pbs,"July 12, 2016",FRONTLINE," The report, from Harvard Kennedy School’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, underscores the role that the press can play in anointing — or sinking — a candidate, as well as keeping voters under-informed by focusing only on the horse race instead of the candidates or relevant issues. It also highlights how the press helped to elevate Trump while contributing to the downfall of rival candidates, and paid relatively little attention to the Democratic nominating contest. For the report, a content analysis firm, Media Tenor, examined statements from CBS, Fox, the Los Angeles Times, NBC,The New York Times, USA Today, The Wall Street Journal, and The Washington Post. “Game-centered reporting has consequences,” the report said. “The media’s tendency to allocate coverage based on winning and losing affects voters’ decisions. The press’s attention to early winners, and its tendency to afford them more positive coverage than their competitors, is not designed to boost their chances, but that’s a predictable effect.” The press doesn’t favor certain candidates because it’s engaged in a vast conspiracy, according to the report. It’s a lot simpler: reporters like a good story. It’s what their business is based on. And this year, Trump’s narrative seemed more novel than that of Clinton or Sanders. This isn’t the first time the press has fallen for a candidate. Barack Obama received “outsized coverage” when he first ran in 2008, as did Sen. John McCain in 2000, when he invited reporters aboard his campaign bus, the “Straight Talk Express.” Trump, the report said, is now on that list. The press’s extensive focus on the horse race also leaves less time for substantive coverage, the report said. It found that mainstream media primary coverage was almost entirely about the competition or the campaign process. By comparison, only 11 percent of the primary coverage focused on the candidates’ policy positions, leadership abilities or personal and professional histories. “Substantive concerns got the least amount of attention,” the report found — on both sides of the aisle. Even before the primaries began, Trump dominated media coverage. For the bulk of the campaign, Trump has received more press attention than any other candidate from either major party, the report found. As he continued to win primaries, his story became about gaining momentum, a narrative that held fast. “Victory for Trump was also his path to positive coverage,” the report said. Sen. Marco Rubio, by contrast, was portrayed as consistently losing ground after he failed to win an early contest. Rubio never had, the report said, “a single week where his positive press outpaced his negative press.” Trump did receive more substantive coverage in the final month of the campaign, when there were no other competitors in the Republican race, the report said. References to his character and policies rose from 10 percent to 19 percent, and the tone was overwhelmingly negative. Ultimately, the report attributed Trump’s candidacy in part to the coverage. “He might have won the Republican nomination in any case, given the confluence of factors working in his favor,” it said. “But one of his assets, certainly, was his press advantage.” On the Democratic side, the candidates generally received coverage on par with their primary results: Clinton received 54 percent of the press attention, versus Sanders’ 46 percent, until the middle stage of the campaign — mid-March to early May — when Clinton pulled ahead. Sanders also received more positive media attention — the largest favorable margin of any candidate, 59 percent good press to 41 percent bad press — until the middle stage of the campaign, the report found. At the same time, reports on Clinton were more critical because as the presumptive nominee, she was expected by the press to dominate the early contests. By the middle stage of the campaign, however, Clinton was eking out more favorable press, 51 percent positive to 49 percent negative. But once she clinched the nomination, she received more criticism, with 49 percent positive statements to 51 percent negative, in part because Trump began to target her in speeches. But no matter what the Democratic candidates did, the Republican contest continued to dominate the press coverage, even when Trump became the presumptive nominee. “Although Trump no longer had active opposition, he received more news coverage in the last month than did either Clinton or Sanders,” the report said, “a development that has no possible explanation other than journalistic bias.” In order to foster a civil and literate discussion that respects all participants, FRONTLINE has the following guidelines for commentary.

pbs,"Oct 7, 2016 2:03 PM EST",Can schools punish students for protesting the national anthem?," How did these protests start? San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, troubled by police treatment of black Americans, began quietly kneeling or sitting during the national anthem in preseason football games this summer. “I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,” he said in an August postgame interview. “To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way.” Kaepernick’s protest stirred support from those frustrated by police shootings of unarmed black men and criticism from others, who said his actions were unpatriotic and disrespectful to military veterans. But other professional athletes joined in and, when school started, high school athletes also started protesting. Many students kneeled, but some took their own approaches. In September, Kaepernick was on the sidelines as players for Castlemont High School in Oakland, California, lay down on the field with their hands up. Other Oakland students, members of the district’s honor band, knelt while playing the anthem before an Oakland A’s game. How are schools reacting to students’ protests? The Oakland school district retweeted supportive messages and news stories about the students’ protests on its official Twitter feed. In other parts of the country, coaches and teachers have joined students in kneeling during the anthem. “Everybody wants to talk about how this is disrespectful to the American flag,” Garfield, Washington, football coach Joey Thomas told the Associated Press. “That’s a smokescreen. How about we talk about the issues people are kneeling and fighting for?” Around the country, dozens of local news stories tell of students taking part in similar protests. While some educational leaders have supported their students’ quiet acts of defiance, others have been more resistant. “Let me be crystal clear: When that anthem is being played, you are to stand and you are to be quiet,” Ryan Nemeth, the principal of Lely High School in Naples, Florida, told students in a video announcement, according to the Miami Herald. Students who don’t stand will be removed from games, the Herald reports. And some school athletic directors have stirred up debate by passing around “reminders” about how student-athletes are to stand quietly during the playing of the national anthem. Can schools discipline students for national-anthem protests? Public schools can’t discipline students for silent acts of political protest that don’t disrupt the operations of a school, like kneeling for the anthem or refusing to say the Pledge of Allegiance, said LoMonte, of the Student Press Law Center. And educational leaders will miss out on learning opportunities if they first seek to end a protest rather than allowing students to learn from it, he said. “The standard should never be: ‘What’s the worst thing we can do to kids and get away with it?'” LoMonte said in an interview. “The standard should be: ‘What’s the healthiest educational practice?’ Schools talk such a great game about wanting to produce civically engaged students…This is something schools should be embracing as a teaching opportunity.” It’s not just a good educational practice to allow silent, unobtrusive acts of student speech; it’s also constitutionally mandated, LoMonte said. While the U.S. Supreme Court has held that “the constitutional rights of students in public school are not automatically coextensive with the rights of adults in other settings,” legal precedents show there are limits on schools’ ability to address speech with discipline. In the 1943 case of West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a school would violate the free-speech rights of its students who were Jehovah’s Witnesses if it forced them to say the Pledge of Allegiance. “To believe that patriotism will not flourish if patriotic ceremonies are voluntary and spontaneous instead of a compulsory routine is to make an unflattering estimate of the appeal of our institutions to free minds,” Justice Robert Jackson wrote in his majority opinion. Schools can’t require students to observe patriotic rituals in the classroom, and their authority to discipline them for such acts diminishes even more at an athletic event, where behavior like shirtless cheering is “a regular occurrence,” LoMonte said. But what about suspending a privilege, like playing on a football team? A school’s authority to discipline students for silent anthem protests isn’t heightened if those students are taking part in a privilege that isn’t granted to all students, like being members of an athletic team or club, LoMonte said. Courts have held that public institutions can’t withhold privileges, like employment at a public agency, if employees exercise free-speech rights, like refusing to recite an anti-communist pledge, LoMonte said. For example, a state’s department of motor vehicles can’t withhold a driver’s license from a blogger who says critical things about its operations, he said, arguing that the same principle is at work when schools seek to suspend students from sports teams for acts of speech. “You can’t condition a privilege on forsaking your constitutional right any more than you can condition a right or a benefit,” LoMonte said. Some school attorneys may point to a 2007 case in which a federal appeals court held that a Kentucky football coach could legally remove four players from his team after they circulated a petition complaining about him. But LoMonte said that situation is different because the coaches were responding not to the players’ speech but to their related actions that “sowed disunity on the football team.” How can schools help students learn from the protests? So, does that mean teachers and coaches can’t tell students why they think it’s important to stand for the national anthem? No, LoMonte said, it just means they can’t suspend students or remove them from a team for choosing to sit or kneel. “That’s a healthy discussion to have, but punishment short-circuits that,” LoMonte said. At a time when schools are increasingly advocating for student voice and calling on students to think critically about current events, educators could use these conversations as a chance to help students grow and learn by asking them to discuss, write, or debate about why one may choose to stand or kneel during the anthem, the underlying racial issues behind the protests, or how the act could be perceived, he said.

pbs,"Jul 28, 2016 11:20 AM EST",Column: Will left vs. right become a fight over ethnic politics?," It was a bit dispiriting to see, in such visual form, that there really are two Americas. The message of the RNC seemed like it was being beamed in from a different country. Meanwhile, under the stewardship of Donald Trump, the Republican Party appears to be morphing into a European-style ethnonationalist party. In a two-party system, this can’t help but affect the Democrats’ own message, since each party comes to define itself, and even understand itself better, in opposition to the other. READ MORE: The thing both conservatives and liberals want but aren’t talking about As powerful as that first night of the DNC was, especially as a member of one of the minorities Trump has so often sought to attack, I couldn’t help but wonder. It was a bit dispiriting to see, in such visual form, that there really are two Americas. The message of the Republican National Convention seemed like it was being beamed in from a different country, at least if your point of reference was growing up in Washington or New York City. It was a dystopian vision of a declining America that was no longer itself. But I could also imagine would-be Trump supporters in “real America” watching the proceedings at the DNC and feeling detached, as if they were watching a country that had moved well beyond them. Here were Democratic politicians, elites and delegates, celebrating diversity in all of its colors and persuasions. I can imagine the emphasis on inclusion seeming, to some, self-satisfied, even condescending, as if we were reminding “angry whites” that they were somehow deficient, and that the responsibility to change their lot was only theirs, and not ours. In my own work in the Middle East, my starting assumption as a researcher has been to suspend my own ideological preferences and to immerse myself in the world of people I don’t agree with and wouldn’t want to live under (namely Islamist movements). I don’t think we do nearly enough of that in our own country. I can imagine the emphasis on inclusion seeming, to some, self-satisfied, even condescending, as if we were reminding “angry whites” that the responsibility to change their lot was only theirs, and not ours. In some sense, it’s almost too obvious. The Democratic National Convention, with its joyous inclusion, is not what America looks like in the more rural expanses of Virginia, where, by chance, I happen to be writing this very piece. One of the towns I passed through, Elkton, Virginia (population 2,762), already seemed like something out of a post-apocalyptic serial, with deserted streets, shuttered general stores, and nothing seemingly happening. Having lived the majority of my adult life abroad, I used to joke with my fellow American expats that I probably knew other countries better than I knew my own. Liberals often complain about rural and working class voters voting against their economic interests. But for a resident of Elkton, I can understand it in reverse. Why wouldn’t they vote for Donald Trump? Hillary Clinton is not promising a break with the past eight years, but a continuation of it. That is part of her appeal – building on and extending Obama’s legacy, at least on domestic policy. But if your experience of the past eight years has been one of economic, social and moral stagnation, or worse, then why would you want something resembling the status quo? I can imagine an Elkton resident watching the Democratic National Convention and not seeing, or hearing, themselves represented. For them, it might as well have been a different country. READ MORE: Column: A first female president? Notable, but not unexpected The risk is that as whites become a smaller majority – and eventually an outright minority – the tendencies toward ethnic politics we’ve witnessed in this election season might very well intensify. The specifics of Hillary Clinton’s policies are almost beside the point. Most Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters will cast their vote for Hillary because it is part of their identity. Liberals and Democrats are not really part of a party, as much as they are part of a new America that looks and thinks differently and has little interest in looking back, wherever that might be. More than a party, it is a lifestyle, a culture and a sensibility, with its own media, institutions, norms and values. Liberals and Democrats are not really part of a party, as much as they are part of a new America that looks and thinks differently and has little interest in looking back. It’s striking that, as Americans sort themselves into various identities, how little Christianity has seemed to factor in, compared to more traditional kinds of ethnic and nationalist markers. These are perhaps our “first real intimations of what a genuinely post-Christian politics might look like,” as Ross Douthat recently put it. From a secular standpoint, this might seem like a good thing in theory, but it’s a bit more complicated in practice. As I discuss in my new book, all states require some unifying set of norms and ideas to bind citizens together (the 14th century historian Ibn Khaldun had a great word for it, asabiyah, which roughly translates as ‘social solidarity’ or ‘group consciousness’). A unifying nationalism is out, since our conceptions of America have apparently become so different. A “moderate Christianity” seems to be out, at least for the time being. Which doesn’t leave us with much. Usually, when I write articles, I try to find a way to end on a positive note. In this case, it’s difficult. Again, I find myself returning to the kind of cross-party civic communitarianism that I sketched out in my previous column. The communitarian instinct is difficult to plot on a traditional left-right spectrum. Some saw communitarian themes in Sen. Cory Booker’s convention address, including his call for a “nation of interdependence” and for a civic virtue of love over tolerance. Whether these divides deepen or retreat will depend on who wins in November and, perhaps just as important, how the losers of the election take their loss. I, however, would more than happily take tolerance right now. We can barely do that much as it is, and perhaps for good reason: quite a lot is at stake. This is perhaps the first election, at least in my lifetime, that sees us, as a country, moving beyond left and right, toward something more inchoate but probably more frightening. But whether these divides deepen or retreat will depend on who wins in November and, perhaps just as important, how the losers of the election take their loss.

pbs,"Nov 14, 2017 6:31 PM EST",House to adopt mandatory sexual harassment training," “Our goal is not only to raise awareness, but also make abundantly clear that harassment in any form has no place in this institution,” Ryan said. “As we work with the Administration, Ethics, and Rules committees to implement mandatory training, we will continue our review to make sure the right policies and resources are in place to prevent and report harassment.” The policy change will happen through legislation. The move comes days after the Senate unanimously approved a measure requiring all senators, staff and interns to be trained on preventing sexual harassment. During a House Administration hearing Tuesday on sexual harassment prevention, Rep. Barbara Comstock, R-Va., said she was recently told about a staffer who quit her job after a lawmaker asked her to bring work material to his house, then exposed himself. “That kind of situation, what are we doing here for women, right now, who are dealing with someone like that?” Comstock asked. Comstock said there should be clear-cut rules about the kinds of relationships and behaviors that are off-limits and create a hostile work environment. WATCH: House committee holds hearing on preventing sexual harassment in Congress Comstock said the name of the lawmaker she mentioned wasn’t disclosed to her, but emphasized that naming names is an important step in promoting accountability and encouraging victims to come forward. At the same hearing, Rep. Jackie Speier said there are two current lawmakers who have been involved in sexual harassment. “In fact there are two members of Congress, Republican and Democrat, who serve right now who have been subject to review, or not been subject to review, that have engaged in sexual harassment,” said Speier. The Democrat from California recently introduced legislation to make training to prevent sexual harassment mandatory for members of Congress after sharing her own story of being sexually assaulted by a male chief of staff. Her bill also includes a survey of the current situation in Congress and an overhaul of the processes by which members and staffers file harassment complaints. The bill gained support from both Democratic and Republican lawmakers. Rep. Gregg Harper, R-Miss., who chairs the House Administration Committee, said in his opening remarks, “I believe we need mandatory training, and probably everyone here would agree.” Speier said since coming forward with her story she’s been inundated with phone calls from staffers eager to share their own accounts of harassment and abuse. A petition calling for Congress to make training mandatory has gained more than 1,500 signatures from former Hill staffers. She did not name the lawmakers mentioned in her testimony, citing the non-disclosure agreements she wants to eliminate. “I’m not at liberty to discuss those cases,” she said, adding that increased transparency is crucial to combatting harassment. One Republican lawmaker, Rodney Davis of Illinois, said addressing the issue of sexual harassment on the Hill is “long overdue” and that Congress must “lead by example.” But he expressed concern that the increasing focus on gender hostility in the workplace could create unintended consequences, including “that some offices may just take a short cut and not hire women as a way to avoid these issues.” Gloria Lett, counsel for the Office of House Employment Counsel, replied that such discrimination is illegal. With each passing day, new revelations of sexual misconduct continue to rock the political sphere. Alabama’s Republican nominee for Senate has come under fire after several women have come forward with accounts of sexually inappropriate behavior or, in at least one case, assault, at Moore’s hand when they were teenagers. In the wake of the allegations, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and other Republicans, including Ryan, have said Moore should step aside. One Republican has suggested that if elected, Moore should be expelled from the Senate. Left:

pbs,N/A,Can Steve Bannon’s revolt against the GOP establishment succeed?," The growing rift over allegations facing Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore. This evening, the NewsHour is confirming word that the Republican National Committee is severing all ties with the Moore campaign. This exposes a growing divide between the so-called GOP establishment and a key player in President Trump’s success, Steve Bannon. John Yang has the story. Roy Moore: I have not been guilty of sexual misconduct with anyone. John Yang: That might be the defense for Roy Moore, the Republican running in Alabama’s special Senate election, but while top establishment Republicans distance themselves from the candidate… Man: I think it would be best if Roy would just step aside. Man: I don’t believe there’d be any place for him in the U.S. Senate. Sen. Mitch Mcconnell: I think he should step aside. John Yang: … the insurgent outsider who’s his champion is doubling down on his support. Steve Bannon: Until I see additional evidence on Judge Moore, I’m standing with him. John Yang: Steve Bannon, the ousted White House adviser who’s looking to send shockwaves through the Republican Party in 2018 and beyond. Bannon is a divisive figure, a political lightning rod as Mr. Trump’s campaign CEO, then a top White House adviser, whose seemingly outsized influence on the president made him a household name. Alec Baldwin: Send in Steve Bannon. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) Actor: Hello, Donald. I have arrived. John Yang: Bannon left the White House in August amid Oval Office tensions and reports he was responsible for the president’s tepid response in denouncing deadly racial violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. President Donald Trump: I think there is blame on both sides, and I have no doubt about it, and you don’t have any doubt about it either. John Yang: Bannon returned to his old job as executive chairman of Breitbart News, a conservative Web site he once dubbed a platform for the alt-right. Now he is chief antagonist for Mr. Trump and his brand of ideology, taking aim at the heart of the Senate GOP and party establishment. Bannon has threatened to identify and support primary challengers against almost every Republican running for reelection next year, except Texas Senator Ted Cruz, and some Democrats. His goal? To load the Senate with insurgents who are loyal to Mr. Trump’s populist ideas and want to buck Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Steve Bannon: There is a time and season for everything. And right now, it is a season of war against the GOP establishment. Michael Steel: It’s an incredibly stupid and a counterproductive idea. John Yang: Michael Steel is a longtime Republican consultant, and a former aide to House Speaker John Boehner and to Jeb Bush’s presidential campaign. Michael Steel: This isn’t a matter of ideology. This is a matter of math. If you have a 52-seat majority in the Senate, where most things in order to move forward requires 60 votes, you need more Republicans, not more pure Republicans. John Yang: Just a year from the 2018 midterms, and Bannon has already claimed credit for upending at least three incumbents, in September, when Moore won the primary against incumbent Senator Luther Strange. Steve Bannon: Every person in this country should get down every night and thank God Donald Trump is president of the United States. John Yang: That same day, Bannon cheered when a moderate Republican from Tennessee announced he wouldn’t run. Steve Bannon: Senator Corker stepped down today. He’s not going to run for reelection. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) John Yang: Then a new height. Sen. Jeff Flake: I am announcing today that my service in the Senate will conclude at the end of my term. John Yang:, Breitbart News, quickly took credit, with a headline flashing: As incumbent senator Jeff Flake of Arizona said he wouldn’t seek reelection either. Bannon’s Web site “Winning: Flake out.” In Arizona, Bannon has endorsed Kelli Ward, a former state legislator. Kelli Ward: I think of myself as an Americanist, and I think that’s what resonates so much with the people in Arizona, and I think that’s what resonated with President Trump across the country. That’s why he’s in the White House, and that’s why I will be in the Senate. John Yang: Ward unsuccessfully ran against Senator John McCain last year. Now she’s casting herself as an American-first conservative insurgent. Kelli Ward: We want a secure border. We want to stop illegal immigration. We want Obamacare out of here. We want the tax code fixed. We want the military to be strong. We want all of those things, and the people who are in Washington, D.C., right now are not delivering. John Yang: At her kickoff party in Scottsdale, Arizona, Bannon made clear it’s him and candidates like Ward vs. the establishment. Steve Bannon: It’s an open revolt, and it should be. These people hold you in total contempt. When they attack a Donald Trump and a Dr. Kelli Ward, it’s not Donald Trump and Kelli Ward they’re trying to shut up. It’s you they’re trying to shut up. John Yang: His message resonated with the crowd. Woman: I am very unhappy with McConnell. I am very unhappy with the Senate. Man: I think they go back to Washington, and they just think they’re set for life there. And they don’t care what the hell the people think about them. Man: Steve Bannon is carrying on with that clear agenda that was promised to us during the Donald Trump campaign. John Yang: For his part, McConnell is already firing back. His super PAC, the Senate Leadership Fund, launched ads linking Ward to a conspiracy theory that the government uses airplanes to spread mind control chemicals. Narrator: Chemtrail Kelly’s got her head in the clouds with crazy ideas. John Yang: He wouldn’t be the first to try and clean House within his own party, says presidential historian Michael Beschloss. Michael Beschloss: Franklin Roosevelt tried that in 1938 with some senators, especially from the South, who were blocking his programs. And he actually would go into the home state of the senator and give speeches against him. It didn’t work. He didn’t get one of them elected. If you’re trying to change the party, that always happens in history over the course of a number of elections. It just doesn’t happen overnight with one election night. And so, when you hear a David Plouffe or a Karl Rove say, I’m not just trying to change the party for this moment, I’m trying to change it for the next generation, that’s very much within the tradition of American history. John Yang: Bannon also says he’s looking for a long-term change. And his first test will be in 2018. For the PBS NewsHour, I’m John Yang.

pbs,"Nov 14, 2017 3:56 PM EST","WATCH: Lawmaker asks Sessions why there’s an FBI report about black ‘extremists,’ but not one about those who are white"," The 12-page FBI intelligence assessment describes “black identity extremist” groups the FBI says are targeting law enforcement after police killings of black men. Foreign Policy first reported on the assessment, which drew outrage from some black lawmakers. Democratic Rep. Karen Bass pressed Sessions on the report during a Tuesday oversight hearing before the House Judiciary Committee. Sessions said he believed there were certain minority groups with the potential for violence. He struggled to answer when asked the same about white groups. He wouldn’t say whether he considers Black Lives Matter an extremist group. It was a tense exchange for Sessions, whose political career has been dogged by questions about race. More: By Erica R.

pbs,"Nov 14, 2017 3:13 PM EST",Senate Republicans may use tax bill to repeal Obamacare individual mandate," Sen. John Cornyn of Texas told reporters on Tuesday: “We’re going to repeal the tax on poor Americans.” Targeting the mandate in the tax legislation would save an estimated $338 billion over a decade that could be used to help pay for the deep cuts in corporate tax rates and other tax benefits under the plan. Without being forced to get coverage, fewer people would sign up for Medicaid or buy federally-subsidized private insurance. GOP senators took up the subject at their weekly lunch meeting, a day after President Donald Trump again prodded Republican lawmakers to include the repeal in their sweeping tax legislation. Left:

pbs,"Nov 14, 2017 12:40 PM EST",Ex-general says nuclear launch order can be refused," Retired Air Force Gen. Robert Kehler told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday the U.S. armed forces are obligated to follow legal orders, not illegal ones. Kehler served as commander of Strategic Command from January 2011 to November 2013. He said the legal principles of military necessity, distinction and proportionality also apply to decisions about the use of nuclear weapons. Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., asked Kehler if that meant the top officer at Strategic Command can deny the president’s order if it fails those tests. Kehler said, “Yes.” But he said that would lead to a “very difficult conversation.” Watch Tuesday’s full Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing:  View two excerpts from the hearing:   Left:

pbs,"Nov 14, 2017 12:40 PM EST",Can Republicans keep Roy Moore out of Congress?," Write-In
One option under consideration would be for Republicans in Alabama to abandon Moore in the Dec. 12 contest and rally around a write-in candidate, perhaps Sen. Luther Strange, who lost to Moore in the primary in September, or even Jeff Sessions, the U.S. attorney general. Sessions, who held the seat until his confirmation earlier this year, is still popular in Alabama. Still, such a candidacy would be an uphill slog, particularly if Moore remains defiant and pulls a sizable vote from his impassioned base of evangelical supporters. With Moore on the ballot, he could siphon votes away from any write-in Republican, potentially swinging the race to Democrat Doug Jones. A Jones victory would narrow the margin of control in the GOP-controlled Senate to 51-49. That’s an outcome Republicans are anxious to avoid. Expulsion
Sen. Cory Gardner, chairman of the Senate GOP’s campaign committee, said Monday that if Moore were to win the election, the Senate might move to expel him, a dramatic step that hasn’t been taken since the Civil War. In that case, GOP Gov. Kay Ivey would appoint another interim senator. The U.S. Constitution says both the House and Senate have the power to “punish its members for disorderly behavior, and, with the concurrence of two-thirds, expel a member.” The Senate has expelled 15 of its members, 14 of whom were supporters of the Confederacy, and hasn’t expelled anyone since 1862. More recently, members such as Bob Packwood, the Oregon Republican who faced charges of sexual misconduct and abuse of power, have resigned rather than face expulsion. In theory, expulsion offers a longshot path for establishment Republicans to reclaim the seat. But Moore would have to win in the first place and do so in the face of a potential write-in candidacy and opposition from state and national Republicans.

pbs,"Nov 14, 2017 12:27 PM EST",Sessions says he has ‘no reason to doubt’ women accusing Senate candidate Moore of sexual misconduct," “I have no reason to doubt these young women,” Sessions told a House committee. His words seemed certain to carry heft in Alabama, where he was a long-time GOP senator until becoming President Donald Trump’s attorney general this year and remains one of that state’s most influential Republican voices. Answering questions before the House Judiciary Committee, Sessions didn’t rule out a federal probe into the charges. “We will evaluate every case as to whether or not it should be investigated,” Sessions said. His remarks came as House Speaker Paul Ryan joined the growing chorus of Washington Republicans calling on Moore to drop out of the race. Republicans fear damage from two potential outcomes should he remain a candidate: Moore wins and GOP senators are tainted by association with a colleague accused of molesting teen-agers, or he loses the Dec. 12 election to a Democrat. “These allegations are credible,” Ryan, R-Wis., told reporters on Tuesday. “If he cares about the values and people he claims to care about then he should step aside.” Senate Republicans face limited options in trying to force out the former state Supreme Court judge and outspoken Christian conservative, whose name remains on the ballot for the special election against Democrat Doug Jones. One option they’ve considered is backing a write-in campaign with another Republican, perhaps Sessions or Sen. Luther Strange, who Moore defeated in a GOP primary in September. Strange told reporters Monday that a write-in candidacy “is highly unlikely.” Moore is showing no sign of quitting, denying allegations by two women that he molested them and sending out fundraising emails emphasizing his stance as a maverick battling establishment politicians. In one sent Tuesday, he referred to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and GOP Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina as “the forces of evil who are attempting to rip and tear apart me and my campaign with their filthy lies and disgusting attacks.” At an abruptly called news conference Monday in Gallant, Alabama, after a woman surfaced with new allegations, Moore said, “I can tell you without hesitation this is absolutely false. I never did what she said I did. I don’t even know the woman.” Moore spoke after a tearful Beverly Young Nelson, now 56, detailed new allegations to reporters in an emotional appearance in New York. One night when she was 16, Moore offered to drive her home from her after-school job at a restaurant in Gadsden, Alabama, she said. Moore, a regular customer, instead parked behind the restaurant and locked the door to keep her inside, squeezing her neck while trying to push her head toward his crotch and trying to pull her shirt off, Nelson said. “I thought that he was going to rape me,” she said. Moore stopped and as she left the car he warned no one would believe her because he was a county prosecutor, Nelson said. She said her neck was “black and blue and purple” the next morning. In Alabama, Jones unveiled a new campaign ad in which state voters, including Republicans, say they can’t vote for Moore. Even before Nelson’s news conference, McConnell took a remarkably personal swipe at Moore, based on last week’s Washington Post reports of other incidents involving Moore and teen-age girls decades ago. “I believe the women,” said McConnell, marking an intensified effort by leaders to ditch Moore. Moore fired back at McConnell on Twitter. “The person who should step aside is @SenateMajLdr Mitch McConnell. He has failed conservatives and must be replaced. #DrainTheSwamp,” Moore wrote. Cory Gardner of Colorado, who heads the Senate GOP’s campaign organization, said if Moore is elected, senators should expel him “because he does not meet the ethical and moral requirements” of the Senate. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said Moore “should not be a United States senator, no matter what it takes.” Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., who’s not seeking re-election after criticizing Trump, said he’d “vote for the Democrat” if he had to choose between Moore and Democrat Jones. Last week, The Washington Post reported that in 1979 when he was 32, Moore had sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl and pursued romantic relationships with three other teenage girls around the same period. The women made their allegations on the record and the Post cited two dozen other sources. Moore denied last week molesting the 14-year-old but didn’t flatly deny he’d dated teenagers, saying in an interview with conservative talk show host Sean Hannity, “It would have been out of my customary behavior.” Nelson said that before the alleged incident that Moore signed her yearbook. A copy of her statement at the news conference included a picture of what she said was his signature and a message saying, “To a sweeter more beautiful girl I could not say, ‘Merry Christmas.’” The tumult comes with Republicans holding a scant 52-48 Senate majority as the GOP rushes to push a massive tax cut through Congress by Christmas.

Moore fired back at McConnell on Twitter. “The person who should step aside is @SenateMajLdr Mitch McConnell. He has failed conservatives and must be replaced. #DrainTheSwamp,” Moore wrote. He also signaled he has no intention of ending his candidacy, writing in a fundraising appeal, “I’d be honored to have you in my corner with me while I slug it out with the forces of evil trying to keep me out of Washington.” The exchange between McConnell and Moore underscored the civil war between establishment Republicans worried that candidates like Moore could cost them their Senate majority and hard-right elements who say McConnell is not conservative enough. Moore has been backed by Steven Bannon, President Donald Trump’s former chief White House adviser who is openly seeking GOP Senate challengers who will pledge to dump McConnell. A political committee linked to McConnell spent huge sums unsuccessfully trying to defeat Moore in the GOP’s September primary, but Moore defeated incumbent GOP Sen. Luther Strange. Republicans have discussed having another Republican like Strange stage a write-in candidacy, but Strange told reporters Monday “a write-in candidacy is highly unlikely.” “I made my case during the election,” Strange said. Cory Gardner of Colorado, who heads the Senate GOP’s campaign organization, said if Moore is elected, senators should expel him “because he does not meet the ethical and moral requirements” of the Senate.

Sessions on Monday left open the possibility that a special counsel could be appointed to look into Clinton Foundation dealings and an Obama-era uranium deal. But before the committee Tuesday, he denied Trump has influenced his decision-making. Sessions says that would be improper. Sessions told the committee: “I have not been improperly influenced and would not be improperly influenced” despite the president’s “bold” comments. More: By Erica R. Hendry Associated Press

pbs,"Nov 14, 2017 11:04 AM EST",Read Jeff Sessions’ prepared House Judiciary testimony on Russia," Sessions said he has “at all times conducted myself honorably and in a manner consistent with the high standards and responsibilities of the Office of Attorney General.” Lawmakers began to question Sessions’ testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in October after ex-Trump aide George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to misleading FBI agents about his contact with Russia. Papadopoulos’ plea in part focused on a March 2016 meeting, which Sessions’ also attended. He told senators he did not have any contact with Russian officials, and “I’m not aware of anyone else that did.” Sessions stood by that testimony on Tuesday, saying “in all of my testimony, I can only do my best to answer all of your questions as I understand them and to the best of my memory. But I will not accept and reject accusations that I have ever lied under oath. That is a lie.” Read his full statement below. And watch the hearing live here. On my first day in this job, I spoke about the “critical role we at the Department play in maintaining and strengthening the rule of law, which forms the foundation for our liberty, our safety, and our prosperity. In this rule of law, we are blessed beyond all nations. And at this Department, we must do all that we can to ensure that it is preserved and advanced. Such ideals transcend politics.” From that day to today, we at the Department of Justice have worked to be faithful to that mission. Let me share some things we have done: The President sent us an order to reduce crime and embrace that mission. The violent crime rate has risen, and the homicide rate has risen by more than 20 percent over the past two years. After careful review, we have established a reinvigorated Project Safe Neighborhood program, as the foundational policy for public safety. It has been proven to get results. In its first seven years, PSN reduced violent crime overall by 4.1 percent, with case studies showing reductions in certain areas of up to 42 percent. We are also focusing on criminals with guns. We have seen a 23 percent increase in gun prosecutions in the second quarter of this fiscal year. And I am honored to lead the superb men and women of the FBI, DEA, ATF, and US Marshals who work together every day with our state and local partners in this core crime fighting mission of the Department. Last year, we saw a staggering 61 percent increase in the number of law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty because of a felony, and on average, more than 150 officers were assaulted every single day. These numbers are unacceptable. Fortunately, we have a President who understands this.  President Trump directed us at the beginning to back our men and women in blue. We are making it clear that we stand with our law enforcement partners 100 percent. They are the solution to crime, not the problem. We have also protected the rule of law in our own Department. We have prohibited so-called third party settlements that were being used to bankroll outside interest groups. We have settled civil cases regarding the Affordable Care Act’s birth control mandate and settled the cases of many groups whose tax-exempt status was significantly and wrongly delayed by the Internal Revenue Service. We have also provided legal counsel to this administration in favor of ending several other unlawful policies. This includes President Trump’s order ending billions in funding for insurance companies that were not appropriated by Congress under the Affordable Care Act. This action, which the House had filed a lawsuit to stop, put an end to one of the most dramatic erosions of the Congressional appropriations power in our history. We put an end to actions by the previous administration to circumvent Congress’s duly passed immigration laws under the DACA policy. That policy gave individuals that were here illegally certificates of lawful status, work permits, and the right to participate in Social Security. We withdrew that unlawful policy, and now the issue is in the hands of Congress where it belongs. We have filed briefs defending properly enacted state voter identification laws, lawful redistricting plans, religious liberty, and free speech on college campuses. In short, it is our mission to restore the American people’s confidence in the Department of Justice by defending the rule of law and enforcing the laws as you have passed them. And it is a mission we are honored to undertake. In response to letters from this committee and others, I have directed senior federal prosecutors to make recommendations as to whether any matters not currently under investigation should be opened, whether any matters currently under investigation require further resources, or whether any matters merit the appointment of a Special Counsel. And, as you are also aware, the Department’s Inspector General has an active review of allegations that FBI policies and procedures were not followed last year in a number of these matters you have raised. And we will make such decisions without regard to politics, ideology, or bias. As many of you know, the Department has a long-standing policy not to confirm or deny the existence of investigations. This policy can be frustrating, especially when there is great public concern or interest about a particular matter.  But it enhances justice when we act under the law and with professional discipline. This policy necessarily precludes any discussion on what cases I may be recused from because to do so would confirm existence of an underlying investigation. To the extent a matter comes to the attention of my office that may warrant consideration of recusal, I review the issue and consult with the appropriate Department ethics officials. Lastly, I would like to address the false charges made about my previous testimony. My answers have never changed. I have always told the truth, and I have answered every question as I understood them and to the best of my recollection, as I will continue to do today. I would like to address recent news reports regarding meetings during the campaign attended by George Papadopoulos and Carter Page, among others. Frankly, I had no recollection of this until I saw these news reports. I do now recall the March 2016 meeting at Trump Hotel that Mr. Papadopoulos attended, but I have no clear recollection of the details of what he said during that meeting. After reading his account, and to the best of my recollection, I believe that I wanted to make clear to him that he was not authorized to represent the campaign with the Russian government, or any other foreign government, for that matter. But I did not recall this event, which occurred 18 months before my testimony of a few weeks ago, and would gladly have reported it. As for Mr. Page, while I do not challenge his recollection, I have no memory of his presence at a dinner at the Capitol Hill Club or any passing conversation he may have had with me as he left. All of you have been in a campaign. But most of you have not participated in a presidential campaign. And none of you had a part in the Trump campaign. It was a brilliant campaign in many ways.  But it was a form of chaos every day from day one. We traveled all the time, sometimes to several places in one day.  Sleep was in short supply. And I was still a full-time Senator keeping a very full schedule during this time. During this year, I have spent close to 20 hours testifying before Congress before today. I have been asked to remember details from a year ago, such as who I saw on what day, in what meeting, and who said what when. In all of my testimony, I can only do my best to answer all of your questions as I understand them and to the best of my memory. But I will not accept and reject accusations that I have ever lied under oath. That is a lie. Let me be clear: I have at all times conducted myself honorably and in a manner consistent with the high standards and responsibilities of the Office of Attorney General. As I said before, my story has never changed. I have always told the truth, and I have answered every question to the best of my recollection as I will continue to do today. With that, I am happy to take your questions. By Erica R. Hendry Erica R. Hendry

pbs,"Nov 14, 2017 10:32 AM EST",Donald Trump Jr. has released his private tweets with WikiLeaks," Donald Trump Jr.’s release of the messages on Twitter came hours after The Atlantic first reported them Monday. In the exchanges — some of them around the time that the website was releasing the stolen emails from Democrat Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman — WikiLeaks praises his father’s positive comments about WikiLeaks and asks Trump Jr. to release his father’s tax returns to the site. The revelations are sure to increase calls in Congress to have Trump Jr. testify publicly as part of several committee probes into Russian interference in the 2016 election. And they add a new element to the investigations that have been probing for months whether Trump’s campaign colluded in any way with the Russian government. In an intelligence assessment released last January, the NSA, CIA and FBI concluded that Russian military intelligence provided hacked information from the DNC and “senior Democratic officials” to WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks has denied that Russia was the source of emails it released, including those from Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta. The private messages released by Trump Jr. show him responding to the WikiLeaks account three times, at one point agreeing to “ask around” about a political action committee WikiLeaks had mentioned. He also asked the site about a rumor about an upcoming leak. The messages began in September 2016 and ran through July. Trump Jr. downplayed the exchanges as he released them. “Here is the entire chain of messages with @wikileaks (with my whopping 3 responses) which one of the congressional committees has chosen to selectively leak,” he tweeted. “How ironic!” Here is the entire chain of messages with @wikileaks (with my whopping 3 responses) which one of the congressional committees has chosen to selectively leak.  How ironic!  1/3 pic.twitter.com/SiwTqWtykA — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) November 14, 2017  2/3 pic.twitter.com/b1B9PBGl5t — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) November 14, 2017  3/3 pic.twitter.com/5FdeNrbg02 — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) November 14, 2017  Trump Jr.’s lawyers had released the exchanges to three congressional committees that have been investigating Russian intervention in the 2016 election and whether there were any links to Trump’s campaign. In a statement, Trump Jr.’s lawyer said thousands of documents had been turned over to the committees. “Putting aside the question as to why or by whom such documents, provided to Congress under promises of confidentiality, have been selectively leaked, we can say with confidence that we have no concerns about these documents and any questions raised about them have been easily answered in the appropriate forum,” said Alan Futerfas. Futerfas didn’t say which forum he was referring to, but Trump Jr. was interviewed behind closed doors by Senate Judiciary Committee staff in September. A person familiar with that meeting said the private Twitter messages were discussed. The person declined to be identified because the transcript of that interview hasn’t been made public. In one message dated Oct. 3, 2016, the WikiLeaks Twitter account sent Trump Jr. an article that included critical comments Clinton had made about WikiLeaks editor Julian Assange and said “it’d be great if you guys could comment on/push this story.” Trump Jr. replied: “Already did that earlier today. It’s amazing what she can get away with.” Two minutes later, Trump Jr. sent another message: “What’s behind this Wednesday leak I keep reading about?” Longtime Trump associate Roger Stone had tweeted the day before that on Wednesday, “Hillary Clinton is done,” referencing WikiLeaks. The WikiLeaks Twitter account never responded, but days later WikiLeaks started rolling out Podesta’s stolen emails. After the emails were released, WikiLeaks sent Trump Jr. a searchable link of the emails. Trump Jr. tweeted that link two days later, on Oct. 14, 2016, The Atlantic noted. The rest of the messages are one-sided, with WikiLeaks sending Trump Jr. messages through July 2017. They include praise for his father for mentioning them on the campaign trail, a plea to release Trump’s taxes to the site and advice on Election Day that Trump should not concede if he lost. One message suggested Trump encourage Australia to appoint Assange as U.S. ambassador. In July, the Twitter account messaged Trump Jr. to ask him to give the site emails surrounding a meeting he and other Trump associates held with Russians during the campaign. Trump Jr. then released them himself. Vice President Mike Pence responded quickly to the revelations, issuing a statement through his press secretary that he knew nothing about the situation. “The vice president was never aware of anyone associated with the campaign being in contact with WikiLeaks,” said spokeswoman Alyssa Farah. “He first learned of this news from a published report earlier tonight.” Assange tweeted after The Atlantic report that he couldn’t confirm the messages but then defended them after Trump Jr. released them. “WikiLeaks appears to beguile some people into transparency by convincing them that it is in their interest,” Assange tweeted. Democrats swiftly reacted to the report, saying Trump Jr. should provide more information. California Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, says it “demonstrates once again a willingness by the highest levels of the Trump campaign to accept foreign assistance.” Schiff also pointed to Cambridge Analytica, a data firm that worked for Trump’s campaign and reached out to WikiLeaks before the election about obtaining emails related to Clinton, according to the company’s CEO. Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said the panel should subpoena the documents and force Trump Jr. to publicly testify. “There seems to be no reasonable explanation for these messages,” Blumenthal said. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley had said he would call Trump Jr. to publicly testify after the private interview in September. But negotiations over witnesses broke down last month amid disagreements with Democrats on the panel. The House and Senate intelligence committees are also expecting to interview Trump Jr., but those interviews are expected to be behind closed doors. Left:

pbs,"Nov 13, 2017 10:02 PM EST",WATCH: Attorney General Sessions testifies on Russia before House committee," Sessions, a key adviser on Mr. Trump’s campaign, came under renewed scrutiny earlier this month after former campaign aide George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to misleading FBI agents about his contact with Russia. Two other campaign officials — former campaign chair Paul Manafort and aide Rick Gates — are also facing charges of money laundering, making false statements to federal authorities and acting as unregistered foreign agents, the first indictments to come from special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. READ MORE: A lot has happened in the Russia investigation. Here’s what you need to know In October, Sessions told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he did not have any contact with Russian officials while he was still a senator and working on Trump’s campaign. “I’m not aware of anyone else that did,” he added. But court documents related to Papadopoulos’ guilty plea indicate that Papadopoulos offered to set up a meeting between Russian president Vladimir Putin and Trump during a March 2016 campaign meeting that Sessions attended. Tuesday’s hearing will likely focus on that meeting as well as Sessions’ other contacts with Papadopoulos, Manafort and Gates. On Twitter, shortly after Papadopoulos’ guilty plea, Trump said the “young, low level volunteer named George” “has already proven to be a liar,” suggesting investigators instead “check the Dems.” Late Monday, the Washington Post and Politico both reported that the Department of Justice also sent a letter to House Republicans that raised the possibility of hiring a second special counsel, this one to investigate possible wrongdoing by the Clinton Foundation. House Judiciary Committee chair Robert W. Goodlatte, R-Va., has twice called for Sessions to investigate a range of his other concerns about the 2016 elections, the Post reported. Sessions recused himself from all investigations related to Russia and the elections in March, shortly after taking office. PBS NewsHour will update this story as it develops.

pbs,"Nov 13, 2017 6:58 PM EST",WATCH: Senate committee holds hearing on president’s ability to authorize nuclear weapons," “This discussion is long overdue,” Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., said in a statement ahead of the hearing, adding it was the first time since 1976 that the Senate or House “have looked specifically at the authority and process for using U.S. nuclear weapons.” The Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on authority to order the use of nuclear weapons will begin around 10 a.m. ET Tuesday. Watch live in the player above. Among those expected to testify are General C. Robert Kehler, former commander of the United States Strategic Command; Peter D. Feaver, a professor at Duke University; and Brian McKeon, former acting undersecretary for policy at the U.S. Department of Defense. “Fire and fury” were among several threats the president and Kim Jong Un exchanged in August over North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs. The country launched several tests in the weeks that followed, including two that sent missiles over Japan. During the United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York in late September, North Korea’s foreign minister said he considered Trump’s tweets to be a declaration of war. Tuesday’s hearing comes as Trump wraps up a 12-day tour of Asia, planned in part to reassure American allies in the region that he could handle growing threats from North Korea — and also that he would not further provoke Kim Jong Un. A North Korean defector told the PBS NewsHour last month that even a limited attack by the U.S. could trigger all-out war. Compared to “fire and fury,” Trump’s remarks about North Korea to South Korea’s assembly were tamer, analysts said. “Do not underestimate us. And do not try us,” Mr. Trump said during last week’s speech. “America does not seek conflict or confrontation, but we will never run from it.” Last month, Corker led a similar hearing on authorization for the use of military force, featuring Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Secretary of Defense James Mattis. Former President George W. Bush signed the military’s current war authorization into law in 2001. “The president’s de facto ability to initiate conflict has grown in an age of advanced technology, including the use of unmanned drones, and war from a distance, where large numbers of boots on the ground are not necessary to conduct a very significant military engagement,” Corker said during that hearing.

pbs,N/A,"GOP candidate Roy Moore faces new allegations, new pressure to quit Senate race"," The Senate's top Republican Mitch McConnell told reporters that he believes the women who have accused Roy Moore of inappropriate actions and that Alabama's GOP candidate must step aside. While the former state chief justice insists he is innocent, McConnell’s condemnation comes as another woman has spoken up. Lisa Desjardins reports that voters appear to have mixed opinions. Judy Woodruff: Alabama’s Republican nominee to the U.S. Senate, Roy Moore, faces new pressure tonight to quit the race, and new allegations of sexual contact decades ago with teenage girls. Lisa Desjardins begins our coverage. Lisa Desjardins: Now 55 years old, Beverly Young Nelson alleges that Senate candidate Roy Moore violently assaulted her when she was 16 after offering her a ride home. Beverly Young Nelson: Mr. Moore reached over and began groping me, him putting his hands on my breasts. I tried fighting him off while yelling at him to stop, but instead of stopping, he began squeezing my neck, attempting to force my head on to his crotch. Lisa Desjardins: Sitting with her high-profile attorney, Gloria Allred, Nelson gave details, including showing that Moore, then district attorney, signed her yearbook a few days before the alleged attack. She says she came forward publicly now after hearing the charges of other women. Beverly Young Nelson: I want Mr. Moore to know that he no longer has any power over me and I no longer live in fear of him. Lisa Desjardins: Her story sparked a new round of reaction. Colorado Senator Cory Gardner, who oversees GOP Senate elections, said the Senate should expel Moore if he win his Senate seat. Hours earlier, the top Republican in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, said Moore should drop out of the race. Sen. Mitch Mcconnell: I think he should step aside. Lisa Desjardins: McConnell added that he believes the accusations from four women in the original The Washington Post story that ran last week. Sen. Mitch Mcconnell: I believe the women, yes. Lisa Desjardins: Moore fired back at McConnell on Twitter, saying the Senate leader is the one who should step aside. Repeatedly, including in Birmingham over the weekend, the former state chief justice has insisted he is innocent. Roy Moore: These attacks involve a minor and they are completely false and untrue. To think that grown women would wait 40 years to come before, right before an election, to bring charges is absolutely unbelievable. Lisa Desjardins: Moore said he will sue The Washington Post over the original story. Those who may decide Moore’s fate, Alabama voters, were mixed following those first accusations, some critical of him. Man: Nothing that he says holds any water with me. Lisa Desjardins: But others taking Moore’s word over his accusers. Man: Yes, right now, I believe him. I surely do. Man: If it was me, if somebody had done me wrong, I would go ahead when the event took place, I would say something then. Why would I wait 30 years? Lisa Desjardins: For now, Moore is set to take on Democrat Doug Jones on December 12. His new accuser says she wants a Senate hearing on her charges within two weeks. For the “PBS NewsHour,” I’m Lisa Desjardins. Judy Woodruff:, two more U.S. senators withdrew their support of Moore: Late today John Cornyn of Texas and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. We will explore the Roy Moore story in greater detail a little later in the program. Watch the Full Episode Nov 13 By PBS NewsHour Support Provided By:

pbs,N/A,How does Trump’s Asia trip affect American trade and security?," President Trump is winding down his 12-day, five-nation trip to Asia by, among other things, meeting with a controversial leader accused of abusing human rights. On the surface, at least, it was all pleasantries between Mr. Trump and his host, Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte. President Donald Trump: We have had a great relationship. This has been very successful. Judy Woodruff:, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said: Up for discussion, trade and fighting terrorism. In public at least, President Trump did not mention Duterte’s bloody crackdown on drug suspects. Philippines officials estimate more than 3,000 people have died. Human rights groups say it is three times that many. Duterte has even boasted of killing men with his own hands when he was younger. After today’s meeting “Human rights briefly came up in the context of the Philippines’ fight against illegal drugs.” A spokesman for Duterte denied that Mr. Trump ever raised the issue. Harry Roque: Well, there was no mention of human rights, there was no mention of extralegal killings. There was only a rather lengthy discussion about the Philippines’ war on drugs. Judy Woodruff: The leaders ignored reporters’ questions. Duterte called them spies, drawing laughter from President Trump. Reactions were sharply different in the streets. Hundreds of people protested the Trump visit, and police beat them back with shields and water cannons. Duterte, though, seemed unfazed. Last night, he even broke into song for his guest of honor. President Rodrigo Duterte: Ladies and gentlemen, I sang, uninvited, a duet with Ms. Pilita Corrales, upon the orders of the commander in chief of the United States. (LAUGHTER) Judy Woodruff: Still, there are differences. Today, Mr. Trump addressed leaders of ASEAN, a bloc of Southeast Asian nations, hoping they will help counter China’s influence. President Duterte is seeking closer ties with China. At a forum yesterday, he called it the number one economic power. President Rodrigo Duterte: The South China Sea is better left untouched. Nobody can afford to go to war. Judy Woodruff, Over the weekend, President Trump drew fire for his embrace of another strongman, Russia’s President Vladimir Putin. They spoke during a summit of Asian-Pacific leaders in Vietnam. Afterward, the president was asked if he pressed Putin on Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election. He answered that, “Every time he sees me he says, ‘I didn’t do that,’ and I really believe that when he tells me that.” Mr. Trump also said U.S. intelligence agency leaders who had confirmed Russian meddling were — quote — “political hacks.” But, on Sunday, he said he was talking about previous agency heads. President Donald Trump: I’m with our agencies, especially as currently constituted with their leadership. I believe in our intel agencies. Judy Woodruff: Tomorrow, the president attends an East Asia summit meeting in Manila, concluding his Asia tour. We take a closer look at the trip and what message Mr. Trump is sending to the region with Richard Haass. He served in Republican administrations on the National Security Council staff and in the State Department. He is now the president of the Council on Foreign Relations. His latest book is “A World in Disarray.” And Michael Pillsbury is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, where he directs the Center for Chinese Strategy. He was also an adviser to the Trump transition. And welcome to both of you. Welcome back to the program. Michael Pillsbury, to you first. What is the main thing the president has accomplished on this trip? Michael Pillsbury: I think there’s two or three things. The main thing is to lay the foundation for his next trip, next year. He has laid the foundation in each of these five countries. He’s taken very seriously the three multilateral organizations that he met with. He’s also integrated trade and security in a very unique way that has not been done for a long time. If you look at his team at some of these meetings, not only has Secretary of State Tillerson — he’s also got Bob Lighthizer from USTR. So it is a unique combination of trade and security put together. It comes out also in some of the bilateral agreements with the five governments. Judy Woodruff: Richard Haass, how do you see the accomplishments on the trip so far? Richard Haass: Well, the principal accomplishment, in the spirit of Woody Allen, was showing up, the fact that the president of the United States went to five countries, spent nearly two weeks, showed up at all these meetings. I think that says that Asia is important to us. This was, however in part undone by his own lack of discipline. You mentioned some of the things in your introduction, the kind treatment of the illiberal, to say the least, president of the Philippines, the statements about Mr. Putin, the trashing of former American intelligence officials. All this detracted from the trip. And where I disagree with Michael Pillsbury fundamentally is the president, rather than integrating security and trade, if anything, divorced the two. And historians will say, I will predict, the principal decision of the trip was to further distance the United States from the dynamism in the region, to keep the United States outside the multilateral trade mechanism, and the principal beneficiary of that is China, as our allies and friends are essentially left to their own devices. Judy Woodruff: Well, let’s take those one at a time, Michael Pillsbury. Michael Pillsbury: Sure. Judy Woodruff: What about his first, Richard Haass’s first point, that the president, with all these comments flattering the strongmen, cozying up to people who have not been seen as friendly to the U.S., that that really hurt the overall effort to get something done? Michael Pillsbury: Human rights was mentioned in the bilateral statement between the Philippines and the United States. So it is a little bit unfair for Richard to say — you know, be as harsh as he is. This is a first time out. And I completely agree with invoking Woody Allen that 90 percent of life just showing up. But it’s more than that. He got some agreements. When I mentioned trade and economics being integrated, I’m talking about the businessmen who showed up in Beijing with a promised $250 billion in deals. Businessmen were part of each of the stops. So it cannot be denied that Trump is trying to integrate trade and investment with security issues. I think also it’s important that he laid out an exit ramp for the leader of North Korea. This is new. Judy Woodruff: Well, let me stop you there. I want to come back to Richard on that point about trade and security, and then we will come back to North Korea. Richard, what about that? Richard Haass: Deals are not the answer. A lot of these deals in part represented previous agreements that then may take five, 10, 15 years to really come to fruition. That is going to then make the size of them quite insignificant. The real economic opportunity was to integrate the United States in the Trans-Pacific Partnership. It would have set very high standards for the region. China is not a part of it. And it would have forced China to make a decision, stay outside the region economically or join it, but join it on term terms that we want, that they have to open up to investment and trade, that they can’t demand certain types of technology transfer, they can’t steal technology. So, we had this mechanism which we helped negotiate, and then Mr. Trump has walked away from it. Judy Woodruff: So, did the U.S. lose ground with regard to China in Asia? Michael Pillsbury: No, I don’t think so. I understand Richard Haass’ criticism of walking away from TPP. I think what the president has in mind is replacing it in two ways. One is some sort of benefit from TPP. It’s not entirely dropped. Some aspects of it can be incorporated in the new framework, which is bilateral agreements with each of these major trading nations. The other thing I need to remind Richard Haass of is an excellent book he once wrote called “Reluctant Sheriff.” It has the concept in that book of a ripeness or ripening, when an issue is ready to be settled. It is a very important thing in geopolitics to know when it is time to do something. Right now, it’s time to move toward more bilateral trade agreements that are fairer to us. It’s also time to talk about North Korea, which he did at every stop, but in a much more measured way than some of the military threats that had been used earlier. In fact, there was very little discussion of sort of an attack on North Korea during the trip. I think that is a good thing. Judy Woodruff: Richard Haass, what about the North Korea point and then about the trade, whether the timing is right? Michael Pillsbury: And about this great book “The Reluctant Sheriff.” (LAUGHTER) Richard Haass: It’s impossible to criticize someone who says nice things about something you have written. (LAUGHTER) Richard Haass: But let me come to North Korea. That’s obviously the most urgent national security threat, not just in the region, but the world. The president, I think, erred by some of his public tweeting and so forth, but, privately, the real question is, over time, did he line up Japan, South Korea and, most important, China to work with us more on putting pressure on North Korea? And even more, I think the question will be, Judy, is the United States now prepared to introduce an element of diplomacy. The choices are essentially living with North Korea with a large missile and nuclear inventory. That is not desirable. Going to war with North Korea, also not desirable. So why not introduce a serious diplomatic dimension? It won’t eliminate the problem, but it could cap and stabilize it and create a baseline. I don’t see that yet. I’m hoping. And, again, this is one trip, I realize. It’s not an entire foreign policy. We will have to look back on it one day. I’m hoping that that ultimately gets introduced. Judy Woodruff: Well, we are going to have an opportunity in the future to look back at this. (LAUGHTER) Judy Woodruff: We want to thank both of you, both the promoter of the book and the author himself. (LAUGHTER) Judy Woodruff: Richard Haass, Michael Pillsbury, thank you both. Michael Pillsbury: Richard is being too harsh on President Trump. That is my final view. (LAUGHTER) Michael Pillsbury: Thank you, Judy. Judy Woodruff: Thank you.

pbs,N/A,What Alabama voters think of the Roy Moore assault allegations," Another woman came forward on Monday to accuse Senate candidate Roy Moore of assaulting her when she was 16, sparking additional political backlash from his own party. But allegations of sexual misconduct against teenage girls haven’t seemed to shake Moore supporters in his home state. Judy Woodruff gets an update from Don Dailey of Alabama Public Television. Judy Woodruff: Now back to the accusations of sexual misconduct against the Republican Party’s Senate candidate in Alabama, Roy Moore. We turn first to Don Dailey. He covers politics for Alabama Public Television, and he joins us now from Birmingham. Don Dailey, welcome back to the program. So, we now have a fifth woman making serious accusations against Judge Moore. What is the reaction there? Don Dailey: Well, we heard today from the head of the Alabama Republican Party in her first public statements since last week’s accusations broke. And she said that it is her interpretation that support for Roy Moore, at least among the party loyal and among his loyal base, seems to be surging. Terry Lathan, who is the chair of the Alabama Republican Party, said today that there are no plans now to seek an alternate candidate or to endorse a write-in candidate in this race. She says anything is possible, but so far the state Republican Party steering committee, which guides her in making decisions, has not decided to meet and discuss this issue. And, again, she is saying, the state Republican Party chair, that Roy Moore’s support seems to be surging. Judy Woodruff: So, Don Dailey, are people there saying they believe these women are simply making all this up? Don Dailey: There are some within the Republican Party, especially those who are very loyal to Roy Moore, his base, who have said they don’t believe these allegations, that they believe he is the victim of a political attack. And they question the timing, obviously, of the allegations released, coming only a month before the election. There are others in Alabama who have said they believe these accusations and that they believe Moore should step aside from the Senate race. They are largely either Democrats or independents or moderates. But Roy Moore’s base, which is fervent and solid here in Alabama — and they have come out and twice supported him in both the primary and run-off elections — by and large seem to be sticking by him so far. Judy Woodruff: And what about the growing number of Republican senators in Washington or from around the country who are saying that he either needs to step aside or they are at the very least withdrawing their endorsement? Don Dailey: I think that is reason for concern among some here in Alabama, even some Republicans here in Alabama. But Roy Moore himself in the last few days has at least wondered aloud in public whether or not establishment Republicans in Washington may have been behind the release of these allegations, Republicans who might be worried about him being a maverick and not necessarily toeing the Republican line. That’s been an open question of debate in this story as it unfolds here in Alabama. But Republicans, by and large, here in Alabama, at least publicly, are saying that they are standing behind Judge Moore for now. Judy Woodruff: And what about the Democrats, Don? What are they saying? Don Dailey: Democrats by and large are expressing a lot of concern about these accusations. They’re saying that they believe these women who have come forward and they believe that the accusations alone are grounds for Roy Moore to step aside. Interestingly, Roy Moore’s Democratic opponent in next month’s general U.S. Senate election here, Doug Jones, has said very little publicly. He has acknowledged the scandal. He has publicly called on Roy Moore to answer these serious charges, as he put it. But his campaign narrative, as he has continued out on the campaign trail in recent days, has been focused more on his core message, things like health care and jobs and the economy, rather than focusing on the allegations against Roy Moore. He seems to be at least sitting back and letting the story unfold on its own. Judy Woodruff: And just quickly, Don, going back to what you said at the very beginning of our conversation, that the head of the Republican Party in Alabama says support for Roy Moore is surging today, are they basing that on polls or anecdotally? Don Dailey: I think it’s probably more anecdotally. You may be aware that a couple of polls have been conducted here in Alabama since these allegations broke. And they have been back and forth on who is the leader of this race. These public polls have suggested that Roy Moore was still ahead. There are others that have suggested that he was tied with Doug Jones. And new reports — or new polls, rather, today went back to suggesting that he is leading by as much as 10 percentage points. Judy Woodruff: All right, Don Dailey with Alabama Public Television, watching it all very closely, we thank you. Don Dailey: Thank you, Judy.

pbs,N/A,How the Roy Moore scandal raises GOP concerns for 2018," Prominent Republicans have called for Roy Moore to abandon his Senate run as another woman comes forward to say he assaulted her as a teen. Can the Alabama candidate weather these accusations of wrongdoing? Amy Walter of The Cook Political Report and Tamara Keith of NPR join Judy Woodruff to discuss this latest GOP rift. Judy Woodruff: And back here in Washington, we’re joined by our Politics Monday team, Amy Walter of The Cook Political Report and Tamara Keith of NPR. Welcome to you both. So, Tamara, we just heard from Alabama, what people are saying down there. What are you hearing here in Washington about this, this new accuser, a woman who came forward today in New York, is from Alabama, but also the senators? Tamara Keith: Yes, so this was — this was different. You know, the past allegations came in a newspaper article. This is live on television video of an accuser who is deeply emotionally distraught and offering very specific details about this event that happened 40 years ago. And, almost immediately, the reaction from senators was prompt. And you have Cory Gardner, who is the head of the NRSC, who is responsible for getting Republicans elected in 2018, saying that Roy Moore should step aside, and, if he doesn’t, expulsion is the direction they would go, trying to expel him from the Senate. And that seems to be the way it’s going. There are a lot of different scenarios that have been gamed out in Washington in recent days. But it seems like Republican senators are starting to consolidate behind that idea. And just moments ago, reporting from the hallways of Capitol Hill, I’m seeing that Luther Strange is out giving interviews. He’s the current Republican senator from Alabama, temporarily, saying that he thinks a write-in candidacy is unlikely at this time. Judy Woodruff: And that is what we were hearing, Amy, from Don Dailey in Birmingham, saying that was what the word is there. It sounds like senators, the Republicans in Washington, now expect that Roy Moore could very well win this race. Amy Walter: Absolutely. Republicans have almost a no-win situation here with Roy Moore. If he wins, they have then the reality in front of them, as Tam pointed out, that many of these senators now calling for his expulsion, or at least one of the most prominent senators there, Senator Cory Gardner, saying, we will expel him from the United States Senate. If he loses, then, of course, they are now down to an only one-seat majority. They’re trying to pass tax reform, which then would be the barest margin, if they don’t pass it by the middle of December. And so this would put so many things in jeopardy. But, as I said, regardless, whether he wins or loses, Republicans are in a very, very difficult place. Judy Woodruff: What kind of territory are we in, Tam, when we are talking about expelling a senator who has just been elected? Do we know yet how that works? Tamara Keith: Yeah, potentially reversing the will of the voters. Judy Woodruff: Exactly. Tamara Keith: There is a process for it. And the reason that these Republican senators are even contemplating this is because this isn’t just about Alabama. This isn’t just about 2017. This is about 2018 and 2020. And if they were to have a fellow senator who is accused of these very serious things serving side by side with them, it would become a campaign issue in every single campaign. Judy Woodruff: So, it may be — it may be that he flies, is acceptable in Alabama, Amy, but their concern is about what this looks like for the rest of the country. Amy Walter: Absolutely. And I think you are already going to see that Democrats are going to try to attach Republican candidates and Republican incumbents to Roy Moore. They’re already asking incumbents and candidates to come out publicly and say what their opinion is of Roy Moore. And so he will become in many ways sort of a poster child for the Republican Party, that is — if you are Republicans, you are worried that you are going to see this person and what he has done in campaign ads all through 2018, even if you have come out and said, I would like to see him gone. Judy Woodruff: Talk about a split Republican Party. Amy Walter: Yes. And this is a bigger challenge, I think, if you just sort of step back for a minute, which is what — the difference between what we are hearing from Alabama in the report you just had before us and what you are hearing in Washington. This has been sort of a constant under the Trump era of the divide in the Republican Party between the so-called establishment here in Washington and Republicans on the ground. The other person that is helping on the ground, of course, is Steve Bannon and Breitbart News, who are encouraging Roy Moore to stay in this race, that are discrediting the women, are trying to find ways… Judy Woodruff: Far-right extremist news site. Amy Walter: Yes. Trying to find ways to discredit the women, discredit The Washington Post. There was a time, Judy, when if a national news organization came in and uncovered serious crimes about a candidate, that would be taken very, very seriously. Now, because it came from The Washington Post, it is discredited. Same with Washington itself. There was a time when a United States senator saying it’s time for to you step down would mean they would step down. Judy Woodruff: Would be the kiss of death. Amy Walter: Absolutely. That matters zero. And so it’s more than just this race, Judy. It goes to show that, whether he comes here or not, there is a new world order that is coming to the way that we do politics. And it is going to reverberate far beyond this race. Judy Woodruff: Well, while all this has been going on, Tam, this has sucked a lot of oxygen out of the room, but there is this tax reform plan the Republicans are trying to get done. There is a House version. There’s a Senate version. What does it look like right now? Tamara Keith: And just to talk about briefly how much oxygen has been sucked out, Mitch McConnell was in Kentucky doing an event about tax reform, when he got asked about Roy Moore and ended up making news about Roy Moore, and no one is talking about taxes. Judy Woodruff: Nobody even knows what he said. Well… Tamara Keith: Well, somebody must know. But that didn’t make the news tonight. So , the House is expected this week to pass their tax bill, and — with Republican votes alone, obviously — and the Senate is working its way through it. They’re marking it up. It is in committee. They — at the moment the House and Senate are on schedule with this very aggressive schedule. But there are a lot of things to work out between now and actually having something that could get to the president’s desk. Judy Woodruff: A lot of things to work out, Amy, but a lot of pressure on Republicans to get this done. Amy Walter: A lot of pressure. When I talk to Republicans, they say, look, this bill may not be the greatest thing in the world, but if we don’t pass it, we are doomed, because we will have completed an entire term with a Republican House and Senate and White House and have absolutely nothing to show for it. It would be a disaster. So, they’re willing to take the risk on a bill that right now, at best, Judy, is polling in the mediocre territory. Voters are pretty ambivalent about it. They would rather take the chance with that than take a chance of not having anything to talk about in 2018. It’s a very difficult place that they’re sitting in right now. Judy Woodruff: And we’re looking at that as we get ready for Thanksgiving. And we will talk about that next week. Amy Walter: Next week, exactly. Judy Woodruff: Amy Walter, Tamara Keith, Politics Monday, thank you. Tamara Keith: You’re welcome. Amy Walter: You’re welcome.

pbs,"Nov 13, 2017 4:38 PM EST",Another woman claims sexual assault by Senate candidate Roy Moore in the 1970s," Even before the news conference by Beverly Young Nelson, Moore’s campaign released a statement saying that attorney Gloria Allred — who’s representing Nelson — “is a sensationalist leading a witch hunt.” It said Moore is innocent and “has never had any sexual misconduct with anyone.” In tears, Nelson said in New York that when she was 16, Moore offered her a ride home from the restaurant where she worked. She accused him of touching her breasts and locking the door to keep her inside his car. She said he squeezed her neck while trying to push her head toward his crotch and tried to pull her shirt off. Moore finally stopped and as she fell or was pushed out of the car, he warned her no one would believe because he was a county district attorney, Nelson said. Before Monday, Moore was already battling allegations reported last week by The Washington Post that he had sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl decades ago when he was in his 30s and pursued romantic relationships with three other teenagers. “I believe the women,” McConnell, R-Ky., said Monday in response to a question at an appearance in Louisville, Kentucky. He said flatly that Moore should step aside for another GOP candidate. When the Post’s story first broke last Thursday, McConnell had said Moore should step aside if the allegations were true. McConnell said a write-in effort by another candidate was a possibility. “That’s an option we’re looking at — whether or not there is someone who can mount a write-in campaign successfully,” McConnell said. Asked specifically about current Sen. Luther Strange, the loser to Moore in a party primary, he said, “We’ll see.” Shortly after McConnell made his remarks Monday, Moore tweeted his response. “The person who should step aside is @SenateMajLdr Mitch McConnell. He has failed conservatives and must be replaced. #DrainTheSwamp,” Moore wrote. The crossfire escalated a GOP civil war over Moore’s Senate candidacy in a Dec. 12 special election, which until last week’s allegations was viewed as an inevitable Republican win in the deep-red state. On the Democratic side, one of the Senate’s moderate members is helping Moore’s challenger raise campaign funds, underscoring the party’s wary approach in an Alabama race that until recently was viewed as a virtually certain win for the GOP. In fact, the fundraising bid by Sen. Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., doesn’t mention allegations about Moore. “Doug’s opponent, Roy Moore, is an extremist with a record of putting political ideology above the rule of law,” Donnelly wrote in a weekend email soliciting contributions for Democrat Doug Jones. Moore and Jones face a Dec. 12 special election to replace Strange, who was appointed to replace Jeff Sessions when Sessions was named U.S. attorney general. In a further indication of Democrats’ caution, the party’s No. 2 Senate leader, Richard Durbin, dodged a question Sunday about what the Senate should do if Moore is elected. He tried to shift the focus back to Republicans. “President Trump is the leader of the Republican Party in America. It’s his responsibility to step forward and say more and do more when it comes to the situation in Alabama,” Durbin, D-Ill., said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” Moore said a lawsuit will be filed over the Post report that detailed the allegations against him. While pressure to quit the race four weeks before Election Day intensified from within the Republican Party, Moore assured supporters Sunday night at a Huntsville, Alabama, gym that the article was “fake news” and “a desperate attempt to stop my political campaign.” Moore said allegations that he was involved with a minor child are “untrue” and said the newspaper “will be sued,” drawing a round of applause. The former judge also questioned why such allegations would be leveled for the first time so close to the special election in spite of his decades in public life. “Why would they come now? Because there are groups that don’t want me in the United States Senate,” he said, naming the Democratic Party and the Republican establishment and accusing them of working together. He added, “We do not plan to let anybody deter us from this race.” Moore, too, has tried to raise money from the controversy, writing in a fundraising pitch that the “vicious and sleazy attacks against me are growing more vicious by the minute.” Even if Moore were to step aside, his name would likely remain on the ballot. And any effort to add Strange as a write-in candidate would threaten to divide the GOP vote in a way that would give the Democratic candidate a greater chance of winning. Moore is an outspoken Christian conservative and former state Supreme Court judge. The situation has stirred concern among anxious GOP officials in Washington in a key race to fill the Senate seat once held by Sessions. Losing the special election to a Democrat would imperil Republicans’ already slim 52-48 majority. But a Moore victory also would pose risks if he were to join the Senate GOP under a cloud of sexual misconduct allegations. Left:

pbs,"Nov 13, 2017 3:38 PM EST","AP fact check: Trump’s statements on the economy, veterans’ health care"," WASHINGTON — Veterans Day prompted President Donald Trump and his administration to take stock of what’s been done to fix health care for those in uniform. They claimed more progress than has been made. That tendency to overreach extended to trade and the economy as Trump visited Japan, South Korea, Japan and then Vietnam, where he told U.S. veterans of the Vietnam War that the Department of Veterans Affairs has made “amazing” strides and already “is a whole new place.” His remarks and a White House account of progress at the VA did not acknowledge old problems that persist. For example, a key effort to improve waiting times by revamping the VA’s electronic medical record system may not be completed for eight more years — when Trump will be out of office. A look at some statements about the VA and other topics arising from his travels and over the past week: WHITE HOUSE: “President Trump signed the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017, taking action to streamline the appeals process for disability compensation claims within the VA. More than 470,000 veterans are awaiting pending decisions regarding their appeals.” THE FACTS: Trump signed the bill in August, part of a bid to reduce a rapidly growing claims backlog, but its immediate impact is overstated, as it will have no effect on the 470,000 pending claims. Under the legislation, veterans will be able to file “express” appeals if they waive their right to a hearing or the ability to submit new evidence. While lawmakers hope the legislation ultimately could reduce average wait times to less than a year, it applies almost entirely to newly filed appeals. Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin has said the VA would need Congress to approve an additional $800 million for “hiring surges” of additional appeals processors if the VA hoped to clear its current backlog within 10 years. READ MORE: Department of Veterans Affairs says money for private health care may run out by year’s end ___ TRUMP: “Right now, our trade with Japan is not fair and it’s not open, but I know it will be, soon. We want free and reciprocal trade, but right now our trade with Japan is not free and it’s not reciprocal.” And: “Many millions of cars are sold by Japan into the United States, whereas virtually no cars go from the United States into Japan.” — remarks to business leaders in Tokyo on Monday. THE FACTS: When Trump calls for reciprocity in Japan-U.S. trade, he might want to be careful what he wishes for. With autos, for example, Japan places no tariff on fully assembled vehicles that are imported. But the U.S. has a 2.5 percent tariff on most imported vehicles — 25 percent on pickup trucks. That imbalance — or lack of reciprocity — favors the U.S. It’s true U.S. vehicle sales in Japan pale in comparison with Japanese sales in the U.S. Detroit has long complained about regulations that stop U.S. carmakers from opening dealerships or selling cars in Japan. But there are other reasons for the disparity in the auto trade, as well. For example, Japan uses right-hand-drive vehicles; the U.S. mainly makes left-hand-drive vehicles in its domestic industry. And Trump’s point about Japanese vehicles pouring into the U.S. is somewhat off the mark. Made-in-Japan vehicles are a distinct minority of the vehicles sold in the U.S. by Japanese automakers. More than half the vehicles sold in the U.S. by Japanese manufacturers are built in the U.S., says the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association. Three-quarters of them are built in North America.

Trump embraces Duterte as Asia trip winds down
By Jonathan Lemire and Jill Colvin, Associated Press



___ WHITE HOUSE statement Thursday: “President Trump announced that the Department of Veterans Affairs will adopt the same Electronic Health Record as the Department of Defense. VA’s adoption … will ultimately result in all patient data residing in one common system, enabling the immediate availability of service members’ medical records and seamless care between the departments.” THE FACTS: While the administration did announce in June that it would overhaul the VA’s aging information technology system, Shulkin admitted to Congress last month that the project to revamp electronic medical records won’t be completed for seven to eight years. The full costs of the project also are not known and have yet to be budgeted. An upgraded IT system is central to the VA’s effort to reduce wait times for medical care as well as to fulfill Trump’s promise of increasing private care options for veterans. Under Shulkin’s plan to expand the Choice private-sector program, the VA would outsource more routine veterans’ care to private providers including MinuteClinics while treating more complex injuries. Success of that plan requires a seamless sharing of medical records not only with the Pentagon but also with private physicians, a capability the VA does not currently have. Shulkin also has yet to negotiate pricing for the no-bid contract with the company that designed the Pentagon’s IT system, estimated to cost at least $16 billion. The big price tag has spurred bills in Congress to require regular updates from the VA on timeliness and cost projections, as well as risks such as breaches to patient privacy. ___ WILBUR ROSS, U.S. commerce secretary: “Today’s signings are a good example of how we can productively build up our bilateral trade.” — remarks Thursday in Beijing. XI JINPING, China’s president: “During this visit, the two sides signed over $250 billion U.S. of commercial deals and two-way investment agreements.” — remarks Thursday in Beijing. THE FACTS: Papers signed in China during Trump’s visit were largely a packaging of previously worked-out deals, tentative investments, statements of intent and extensions of business with existing Chinese customers, with some new orders. They do not point to a turnaround in deep-seated trade tensions between China and the U.S. Such signing ceremonies in China are often just that, ceremonial. They typically represent purchases that Chinese customers already planned to make and held off on announcing. General Motors’ $2.2 billion piece of the package, for example, consists mostly of selling parts to its existing joint venture with the Chinese government. Alaska, however, welcomed an agreement that could spur construction of a long-sought pipeline to ship natural gas from the North Slope to a port for export to Asia. Oil companies backed away from the project, but the agreement with Chinese interests means all parties will work toward a decision by the end of next year on whether to proceed. ___ WHITE HOUSE: “President Trump has ensured continued access to care in the Veterans Choice Program by signing the VA Choice and Quality Employment Act, authorizing $2.1 billion in additional funds for the Veterans Choice Program.” THE FACTS: This statement glosses over one of several budget shortfalls by the VA. Congress was forced in August to approve $2.1 billion in emergency money to keep Choice running after the VA had repeatedly understated costs of the program, assuring lawmakers for much of the year that money would last until January. Shulkin subsequently revealed an emergency shortfall in June that threatened medical care for tens of thousands of veterans. The $2.1 billion was intended to last until February. But weeks after receiving the money, the VA acknowledged that money for Choice would again run out sooner than expected, requiring Congress to approve additional stopgap financing before the end of the year or face disruptions to veterans’ health care. Lawmakers have yet to act, in part as the Trump administration sorts out longer-term costs to the private-sector program. READ MORE: Can President Trump keep his promises to veterans? ___ WHITE HOUSE: “The VA has launched its ‘Access and Quality Tool,’ allowing veterans to see online the wait times at VA locations.” THE FACTS: An effort started by Shulkin when he was VA undersecretary of health in President Barack Obama’s administration, the VA website www.accesstocare.va.gov provides data on wait times as well as on veterans’ satisfaction ratings in getting timely appointments, something that no other health care system in the country does. Still, major veterans groups such as Veterans of Foreign Wars have faulted the data for being misleading and not depicting wait times the way a typical person would view it. The Government Accountability Office, for instance, has noted that the data for returning patients do not include the amount of wait time from when a veteran initially asks for care and when a scheduler reaches out to set an appointment, which it said could be lengthy. In addition, GAO earlier this year continued to find evidence that VA data can be unreliable because of schedulers recording wrong dates or changing dates outright, though the VA says it is implementing new checks and training to help identify “outliers” in scheduling. Veterans of Foreign Wars told Congress last month that its survey found only 67 percent of veterans said they had obtained a VA appointment within 30 days, less than the 93 percent that VA reports. ___ WHITE HOUSE: “The White House has opened a brand new VA Hotline staffed principally by veterans and direct family members of veterans to ensure that no complaint goes unaddressed.” THE FACTS: It opened, but it did not get off to a smooth start. Trump pledged during the presidential campaign to create a “private White House hotline” answered by a real person 24 hours a day to take complaints from veterans, leading the VA to create a hotline beginning in June. Originally scheduled to be fully operational by Aug. 15, it has encountered some delays. In a letter to the VA last month, Sen. Jon Tester, the top Democrat on the Veterans Affairs Committee, complained, “The White House is frequently routing these calls back to local VA offices, which are often understaffed and do not have the ability to address the additional casework in a timely manner.” Tester noted the VA already had several existing options for receiving complaints from veterans and urged better coordination to make sure no one falls through the cracks. ___ TRUMP: “Numbers are phenomenal over the last — since November 8th, Election Day. Our unemployment is at a 17-year low. We’ve gotten almost 2 million more people in the workforce in just that short period of time. I’ve reduced regulations terrifically, frankly, if I do say so myself.” — remarks to business leaders in Tokyo, Monday. Tweet from previous weekend: “Unemployment is down to 4.1%, lowest in 17 years. 1.5 million new jobs created since I took office. Highest stock Market ever, up $5.4 trill.” THE FACTS: His numbers are close to the mark. Trump can rightfully brag about the U.S. economy, but it’s not quite as exceptional as he says, and he can’t yet legitimately claim that his record on job creation is vastly superior to Obama’s. Many of the economic figures he cites are advancing a recovery from the Great Recession that dates back to the middle of 2009. The unemployment rate did slip to 4.1 percent in October. But that was in part because many Americans gave up searching for work — one of the criticisms Trump made of Obama’s record during the 2016 campaign. READ MORE: 6 takeaways from the October jobs report Trump also takes credit for helping create on average 168,500 jobs a month, but Obama in 2016 averaged about 187,000 jobs a month. Of course, hiring should slow as the unemployment rate declines because fewer people are searching for work. When someone stops seeking a job and drops out of the labor force, this person is no longer counted among the officially unemployed. As for the stock market, the Dow Jones Industrial Average returned to its previous peak in March 2013 and has been setting records ever since. The promise of corporate tax cuts by Trump has helped the stock market, but many of the gains rest on the foundations of an economic recovery that saw corporate profits climb.

                                    — Updated on Nov 13, 2017 1:20 PM EST",McConnell says Roy Moore ‘should step aside’," The Kentucky Republican said flatly that Moore should step aside for another GOP candidate days after the Washington Post report that rocked the campaign for what the GOP had considered an inevitable special election win on Dec. 12. When the story first broke last Thursday, McConnell had said Moore should step aside if the allegations were true. McConnell, questioned at a tax event in Louisville, said a write-in effort by another candidate was a possibility. “That’s an option we’re looking at … whether or not there is someone who can mount a write-in campaign successfully,” McConnell said. Asked specifically about current Sen. Luther Strange, the loser to Moore in a party primary, he said, “We’ll see.” On the Democratic side, one of the Senate’s moderate members is helping Moore’s challenger raise campaign funds, underscoring the party’s wary approach in an Alabama race that until recently was viewed as a virtually certain win for the GOP. In fact, the fundraising bid by Sen. Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., doesn’t mention allegations about Moore. “Doug’s opponent, Roy Moore, is an extremist with a record of putting political ideology above the rule of law,” Donnelly wrote in a weekend email soliciting contributions for Democrat Doug Jones. Moore and Jones face a Dec. 12 special election to replace Strange, who was appointed to replace Jeff Sessions when Sessions was named U.S. attorney general. Donnelly’s email also cites Jones’ background as “the son of a steelworker” and a prosecutor who “worked to lock away members of the KKK and terrorists for despicable acts of violence.” Donnelly faces re-election next year in Indiana and is considered one of his party’s most endangered incumbents. In a further indication of Democrats’ caution, the party’s No. 2 Senate leader, Richard Durbin, dodged a question Sunday about what the Senate should do if Moore is elected. He tried to shift the focus back to Republicans. “President Trump is the leader of the Republican Party in America. It’s his responsibility to step forward and say more and do more when it comes to the situation in Alabama,” Durbin, D-Ill., said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” Moore said a lawsuit will be filed over the Post report that detailed the allegations against him. While pressure to quit the race four weeks before Election Day intensified from within the Republican Party, Moore assured supporters Sunday night at a Huntsville, Alabama, gym that the article was “fake news” and “a desperate attempt to stop my political campaign.” Moore said allegations that he was involved with a minor child are “untrue” and said the newspaper “will be sued,” drawing a round of applause. The former judge also questioned why such allegations would be leveled for the first time so close to the special election in spite of his decades in public life. “Why would they come now? Because there are groups that don’t want me in the United States Senate,” he said, naming the Democratic Party and the Republican establishment and accusing them of working together. He added, “We do not plan to let anybody deter us from this race.” The Post story quoted four women by name, including the woman who alleged the sexual contact at 14, and had two dozen other sources. Moore, too, has tried to raise money from the controversy, writing in a fundraising pitch that the “vicious and sleazy attacks against me are growing more vicious by the minute.” Even if Moore were to step aside, his name would likely remain on the ballot. And any effort to add Strange as a write-in candidate would threaten to divide the GOP vote in a way that would give the Democratic candidate a greater chance of winning. Moore is an outspoken Christian conservative and former state Supreme Court judge. While he has called the allegations “completely false and misleading,” in an interview with conservative radio host Sean Hannity he did not wholly rule out dating teenage girls when he was in his early 30s. Asked if that would have been usual for him, Moore said, “Not generally, no.” The situation has stirred concern among anxious GOP officials in Washington in a key race to fill the Senate seat once held by Sessions. Losing the special election to a Democrat would imperil Republicans’ already slim 52-48 majority. But a Moore victory also would pose risks if he were to join the Senate GOP under a cloud of sexual misconduct allegations. Schreiner reported from Louisville, Kentucky.

pbs,"Nov 13, 2017 11:40 AM EST",Trump names former drug executive as new health secretary," The nomination of Alex Azar is unusual because HHS secretaries have tended to come from the ranks of elected officials such as governors, leaders in academia, or top executive branch managers — not industries regulated by the department. “He will be a star for better healthcare and lower drug prices!” Trump tweeted in announcing the nomination Monday morning. Azar, 50, a lawyer by training, has spent most of the last 10 years with pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly, rising to president of its key U.S. affiliate before leaving in January to start his own consulting firm. He’s seen as an expert on government health care regulation. As HHS secretary, Azar would have to scrupulously avoid conflicts with Lilly’s far-reaching interests, from drug approval to Medicare reimbursement. The drugmaker has drawn criticism from patient advocacy groups for price increases to one of its biggest products: insulin. Americans consistently rank the high cost of prescription drugs as one of their top health care priorities, putting it ahead of divisive issues like repealing “Obamacare” in public opinion polls. Trump has been a sharp critic of the industry. “The drug companies, frankly, are getting away with murder,” the president said at a Cabinet meeting this fall. Prices are “out of control” and “have gone through the roof,” Trump said. In the spring, a Trump tweet sent drug stocks tumbling after the president said he was working on a new system that would foster competition and lead to much lower prices. In meetings with industry executives, however, Trump has focused on speeding up drug approvals, a cost-reducing tactic they would back. Professionally, Azar has another set of skills that may be valuable to the president. As a top HHS official during the George W. Bush administration, the Yale law graduate developed an insider’s familiarity with the complex world of federal health care regulation, serving first as the department’s chief lawyer and later as deputy secretary. Frustrated by fruitless efforts to overturn the Affordable Care Act in Congress, Trump might see the regulatory route as his best chance to make a mark on health care. Congressional Democrats are likely to pounce on Azar’s drug ties, reminding Trump of his promise to “drain the swamp” of Washington influence peddling. Azar admirers say his industry experience should be considered an asset, not a liability. “To the extent that the Trump administration has talked about lowering drug prices, here’s a guy who understands how it works,” said Tevi Troy, who served with Azar in the Bush administration and now leads the American Health Policy Institute, a think tank focused on employer health insurance. “Would (Azar) have been better off if he had been meditating in an ashram after serving as deputy secretary?” asked Troy. Azar spent his formative years in Maryland. He got his bachelor’s degree in government and economics from another Ivy League institution, Dartmouth. He once clerked for the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, a revered figure for conservatives. During the Bill Clinton years, he served a stint with independent counsel Kenneth Starr. If confirmed, Azar would be Trump’s second HHS secretary, replacing former Georgia congressman Tom Price, who stepped down after just seven months, when his use of private charter planes for government travel created a public controversy that displeased the president.

pbs,"Nov 13, 2017 10:39 AM EST",Trump embraces Duterte as Asia trip winds down," Trump repeatedly praised Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, calling him by his first name, sharing a joke about the media and even complimenting Manila’s weather. What he did not do was what many predecessors have done before: highlight human rights abuses while overseas. Duterte has overseen a bloody drug war that has featured extrajudicial killings. He has even boasted about killing people with his own hands. But during brief remarks to reporters, Trump said he and Duterte have “had a great relationship” and avoided questions on whether he’d raise human rights issues with the Filipino leaders. The White House later said the two leaders discussed the Islamic State, illegal drugs and trade during the 40 minute meeting. Spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said human rights came up “briefly” in the context of the Philippines’ fight against illegal drugs. She did not say if Trump was critical of Duterte’s program. That appeared to conflict with the Filipino version of the meeting. Harry Roque, a spokesman for Duterte, said “there was no mention of human rights. There was no mention of extralegal killings. There was only a rather lengthy discussion of the Philippine war on drugs with President Duterte doing most of the explaining.” On the sidelines of an international summit, Trump looked to strengthen ties with Pacific Rim allies, aiming to strike bilateral, rather than multinational trade agreements, and increase pressure on North Korea to abandon its nuclear program. He met with India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday and highlighted their two nations’ “deeper and more comprehensive” ties, looking to strengthen a relationship that is vital to the U.S. vision of an Indo-Pacific region that attempts to de-emphasize China’s influence. He jointly met with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, with whom he had a contentious phone call last winter, and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who hosted the president in Tokyo earlier in the trip. Trump raved about his accomplishments on his five-nation journey, particularly on trade and on North Korea, which the White House has suggested may be designated a state sponsor of terror. Trump said he would wait until his return to Washington on Wednesday to elaborate with a “major statement” on those two topics but hinted at progress while in Manila. “We’ve made some very big steps with regard to trade — far bigger than anything you know,” Trump told reporters, pointing to business deals forged between U.S. and foreign companies. “We’ve made a lot of big progress on trade. We have deficits with almost everybody. Those deficits are going to be cut very quickly and very substantially,” Trump said. “Except us,” Turnbull chimed in, to laughs. “You’re the only one,” Trump responded. Trump also said the trip had been “very fruitful” for the United States and pointed to the warm welcomes he had received in capitals like Tokyo, Seoul and Beijing. “It was red carpet like nobody, I think, has probably ever received,” Trump said. “And that really is a sign of respect, perhaps for me a little, but really for our country. And I’m really proud of that.” Trump met privately with Turnbull later Monday. But his interactions with Duterte drew the most scrutiny. Advisers had said that while Trump was always unlikely to publicly chastise Duterte, he might offer criticisms behind closed doors. Trump would hold his tongue in public to avoid embarrassing Duterte, whom he is urging to help pressure North Korea and fight terrorism, and to avoid pushing him into the arms of China. Duterte has seemed less committed to the strategic partnership with the U.S. Duterte’s war on drugs has alarmed human rights advocates around the world who say it has allowed police officers and vigilantes to ignore due process and to take justice into their own hands. Government officials estimate that well over 3,000 people, mostly drug users and dealers, have died in the ongoing crackdown. Human rights groups believe the victim total is far higher, perhaps closer to 9,000. The opening ceremonies of the Association for Southeast Asian Nations conference began with pageantry, including a group photo of the leaders and the summit’s traditional handshake. That cross-body handshake, during which each leader shakes the opposite hands of those next to him or her, briefly baffled Trump, who then laughed as he figured out where to place his arms. Associated Press writers Ken Thomas and Laurie Kellman in Washington contributed to this report. Left:

pbs,"Nov 13, 2017 10:26 AM EST","Roy Moore dismisses sexual allegations in story, says lawsuit to come"," Moore’s condemnation of a Washington Post story during a campaign speech in Huntsville, Alabama, came hours after another fellow Republican, Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, urged him to drop out of a special election for one of Alabama’s Senate seats. Toomey said Moore’s explanations had been inadequate and that Republicans should consider Sen. Luther Strange as a write-in candidate to run against Moore. Strange lost the Republican primary to Moore. Moore tried to raise money from the controversy, writing in a fundraising pitch sent about midafternoon that the “vicious and sleazy attacks against me are growing more vicious by the minute.” He told supporters, “I’m counting on you to stand with me at this critical moment by chipping in a donation to help me bust through the vicious lies and attacks and get the truth out to as many voters as possible before December 12.” The Post story quoted four women by name, including the woman who alleged the sexual contact at 14, and had two dozen other sources. In a Huntsville gym, Moore assured supporters that the Post story was “a desperate attempt to stop my political campaign” and that the allegations that he was “involved with a minor child are completely unfalse and untrue and for which they will be sued,” drawing a round of applause. He also questioned why such allegations would be leveled for the first time just weeks before the special election in spite of his decades in public life. “Why would they come now? Because there are groups that don’t want me in the United States Senate,” he said, naming the Democratic Party and the Republican establishment and accusing them of working together. He added, “We do not plan to let anybody deter us from this race.” Toomey did not rule out the possibility that Senate Republicans might work to unseat Moore if he wins the special election against Democrat Doug Jones. “You know, this is a terrible situation, nearly 40-year-old allegation, we’ll probably never know for sure exactly what happened,” Toomey said on “Meet the Press” on NBC. “But from my point of view, I think the accusations have more credibility than the denial. I think it would be best if Roy would just step aside.” The White House, pointedly noting that President Donald Trump did not back Moore during the primary, said Trump will likely weigh in on the Senate race when he returns from Asia later this week. The White House has already made clear that Moore should step aside if the allegations are proven to be true. “I think there’s a special place in hell for those who actually perpetrate these crimes,” White House legislative aide Marc Short said Sunday. “But, having said that, he hasn’t been proved guilty,” Short added. “We have to afford him the chance to defend himself.” Moore is an outspoken Christian conservative and former state Supreme Court judge. The Post reported last Thursday that he had sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl and pursued three other teenagers decades earlier. While he called the allegations “completely false and misleading,” in an interview with conservative radio host Sean Hannity he did not wholly rule out dating teenage girls when he was in his early 30s. Asked if that would have been usual for him, Moore said, “Not generally, no.” The story stirred concern among anxious GOP officials in Washington in a key race to fill the Senate seat once held by Jeff Sessions, now the U.S. attorney general. Losing the special election to a Democrat would imperil Republicans’ already slim 52-48 majority in the Senate, which is hoping to pass a tax overhaul later this year. But a Moore victory also would pose risks if he were to join the Senate GOP with a cloud of sexual misconduct allegations. In the immediate aftermath of the Post report, a wave of national Republican leaders called for Moore to drop out of the race if the allegations are true. They included the head of the House Freedom Caucus, Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Over the weekend, more Republicans distanced themselves from Moore. “Look, I’m sorry, but even before these reports surfaced, Roy Moore’s nomination was a bridge too far,” tweeted Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., on Saturday. Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., on Sunday said Moore’s denials seemed to raise more questions. “Certainly, the allegations are very, very strong. The denial was not as strong as the allegations,” Scott said. “If the allegations are true, there is no doubt he should step aside. And not for the party, but for the American people. We have to find a way to restore trust and confidence in our elected officials in our government, and this goes in the wrong direction.” Even if Moore were to step aside, his name would likely remain on the ballot. And any effort to add Strange as a write-in candidate would threaten to divide the GOP vote in a way that would give the Democratic candidate a greater chance of winning. Moore beat Strange in the Republican primary in September. Mindful of the stakes, Democrats on Sunday appeared largely content to let Republicans debate whether Moore should be their standard bearer in the race. “Look, we all know that Alabama is a very tough state politically for Democrats, but this is a special situation where we have a great candidate,” said Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. “On the other hand, you have a very, very flawed candidate in Roy Moore, which is why many people are calling upon him to step down, but I’m going to leave this to the people of Alabama. This is their decision,” he said. Toomey and Short appeared on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Scott spoke on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” and Van Hollen was on “Fox News Sunday.” Left:

pbs,N/A,Trump walks back remarks on Russia as GOP faces challenges at home," While the president has focused on foreign policy in Asia there have been developments in domestic politics, from the Democratic sweep in Virginia’s elections last week to accusations of sexual abuse against Roy Moore, a Republican nominee in the Alabama Senate special election scheduled for next month. But taking the long view there may be a bigger political story worth paying attention to NewsHour Weekend special correspondent Jeff Greenfield joins me now from Santa Barbara, California. So it feels to me like this has been a really big week in politics but you say there’s something else me we should be focusing on? Jeff Greenfield: Yeah there’s a less dramatic story but when I think that potentially has much more significance and that is the retirements among House Republican members 25 incumbent Republicans have said they will not seek re-election. That’s a very high number this early in the cycle and a lot of these Republicans come from districts that are the kind of districts filled with voters that helped give the Virginia Democrats their big margin, that is they’re suburban they’re educated, they’re younger. And we should remember that that 23 Republicans in the House represent districts that Hillary Clinton carried. Why does this matter? Because traditionally it’s easier for a party to win an open seat than to defeat an incumbent. And you have to wonder whether or not some of these Republicans have a couple of whom have already been critical of the more militant members of their own party are looking at Virginia and wondering whether it’s time for them to think about their career move. So this could this could be a big story. Twenty-four seats are what stand between Democrats and taking control of the House. Megan Thompson: Okay, so then a lot of open seats up for grabs in the House. How about in the Senate? Jeff Greenfield: It’s night and day for the Democrats. As good as things may be looking right now in the House for Democrats, it’s bleak in the Senate. There are only eight Republicans up in 2018. Only one, Nevada’s Dean Heller, is from a state that Hillary Clinton carried. By contrast, eight Democratic incumbents are running in seats that Trump carried, five in states that Trump carried by anywhere from 19 to 35 points. And a lot of these states have far fewer of the kind of voters we saw turn out in Virginia. So if you’re if you’re a Democrat you may be very pessimistic now. There’s one cautionary note and that’s Judge Moore. If he wins and the Senate can’t figure out a way to not seat him, he will become a poster boy next year in every race in the country other than Alabama. I’ll remind you that in 2012 one Republican nominee Todd Akin made some very ham-handed comments about abortion and that became an issue not just in his race which he lost but in a lot of other Senate races. So if you are Mitch McConnell, the Republican Senate leader, even though you may be risking the loss of a Senate seat the last thing in the world you want is Senator Roy Moore from Alabama to be in your caucus. Megan Thompson: Speaking of Roy Moore a lot of Republicans in Washington kept their distance from him this week but Republicans in Alabama are sticking with him. How do you think that’s going to play out? Jeff Greenfield: Look I think there’s a broader point here and that has to do with how polarized this country has become politically. We’re now at a point where 40 percent of Republicans and a third of Democrats say they’d be really upset if one of their kids married somebody from another political party. And you have actually had in Alabama State Republican official and others saying I’d rather have a pedophile than a Democrat in that seat. And on a slightly less head-shaking note you have had other Republicans and conservatives trying to see well can we postpone this election. So maybe we can have a do over. I mean that is about as unprecedented a thing as you can imagine in the way we do politics. But it just goes to show you that for some people no matter what the allegations apparently if the choice is between say an accused pedophile and a member of the other party, I don’t want that or the party to win that. That’s quite a sea change over the last generation and how we think about partisan politics. Megan Thompson: All right Jeff Greenfield thank you so much for joining us.

He said: “It’s time we wake up and talk about what really matters: 25,000 people dying every day because of pollution.” Schwarzenegger also criticized the environmental community for “missing the point” with its messaging on global warming. He said: “People do not focus as much on 2 degrees energy increases in temperatures or increases in sea levels rising.” Schwarzenegger thinks calling attention to concrete issues, like “so many people having problems with cancer and kids with asthma,” is a better approach.

pbs,"Nov 12, 2017 11:03 AM EST",Allegations against Roy Moore roil U.S. evangelical ranks," Now, as Moore’s Republican U.S. Senate campaign is imperiled by allegations of sexual overtures to a 14-year-old girl when he was in his 30s, there’s an outpouring of impassioned and soul-searching discussion in evangelical ranks. “This is one of those excruciating decision moments for evangelicals,” Albert Mohler, president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, said in a telephone interview. “These allegations, if true, are devastating. If true, this is a very big deal.” Mohler said Alabama voters face a potentially wrenching task of trying to determine if the allegations — Moore has emphatically denied them — are credible. According the Pew Research Center, 49 percent of Alabama adults are evangelical Protestants. For some of them, the Moore allegations echo the quandary they faced last year, wrestling over whether to support Donald Trump in the presidential race despite his crude sexual boasts. The Rev. Robert Franklin, professor of moral leadership at Emory University’s Candler School of Theology in Atlanta, said The Washington Post’s report about the Moore allegations represents a test of “moral consistency” for evangelicals. “Evangelicals are steadily losing their moral authority in the larger public square by intensifying their uncritical loyalty to Donald Trump,” Franklin wrote in an email. “Since this is Roy Moore and not Donald Trump, I think there may be significant disaffection with him, and increased demands for his removal from the ballot.” As for Moore himself, Franklin suggested there were “classic evangelical remedies” such as confession, prayer and remorse and isolation. “Election to higher office is not one of them,” Franklin wrote. Although Trump won 80 percent of the white evangelical vote in his presidential victory, his candidacy exposed and hardened rifts among conservative Christians about partisan politics, the personal character of government leaders and the Gospel. Surveys by the Public Religion Research Institute found that the percentage of white evangelicals who said they still trusted the leadership of a politician who commits an immoral act rose from 30 percent in 2011 to 72 percent last year. Still, a solid minority of conservative Christians adopted the NeverTrump hashtag on social media and joined those outside evangelicalism who said “values voters” had lost their values. Women and black evangelicals especially emerged as critics of Trump’s remarks about women, immigrants, African-Americans and Muslims. Many of these same critics of Trump’s behavior and rhetoric condemned Moore in recent days and bemoaned the fact that some evangelicals were standing by him. “Okay, seriously, we elected a man president who bragged about using his power and authority to sexually assault women,” tweeted Kyle James Howard, an African-American student at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. “Why are we surprised that members of his party would now be defending a party member’s sexual assault of a minor?” One of the Southern Baptist Convention’s leading public policy experts, the Rev. Russell Moore, expressed dismay after the allegations against Judge Moore — no relation — surfaced on Thursday. “Whether in the hills of Hollywood or the halls of power, it doesn’t matter,” the Rev. Moore tweeted. “This is true: sexual assault and child molestation are evil, unjust, satanic.” Roy Moore embraced controversy as he built his evangelical following. He was twice removed from his post as Alabama’s chief justice, once for disobeying a federal court order to remove a Ten Commandments monument from the lobby of the state judicial building, and later for urging probate judges to defy the U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing gay marriage. Among those declining to break with Moore in the wake of the sex allegations was Jerry Falwell Jr., president of evangelical Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia. “It comes down to a question of who is more credible in the eyes of the voters — the candidate or the accuser,” Falwell told Religion News Service. “And I believe the judge is telling the truth.” Mohler, the seminary president, said many evangelical Alabama voters will find themselves facing a difficult choice when ballots are cast in the Dec. 12 special election. “There’s so much at stake,” he said. “Those of us who are pro-life have got to be very concerned about losing even one seat in the U.S. Senate.” The Democratic candidate in the special election, Doug Jones, has said that a decision on whether to have an abortion should generally be left to the woman in question. Abortion policy also was evoked by Ed Cyzewski, a Kentucky-based seminary graduate and author, in a series of Twitter posts Friday questioning why some of his fellow evangelicals would continue to stand by Moore. “Right now there are evangelicals who feel trapped,” Cyzewski wrote. “They think Moore did something reprehensible, but believe abortion is evil.” Katelyn Beaty, an editor at large with the evangelical magazine Christianity Today, suggested that among many of Moore’s evangelical supporters, there’s a “presumption of innocence” because of their mistrust of national media such as The Washington Post. “Many Christian communities have trouble appropriately responding to sex abuse allegations,” Beaty wrote in an email. “There is a default trust in powerful, charismatic male leaders, coupled with a discomfort with women who use their story or voice to challenge the status quo or power structures.” However, Beaty said more moderate evangelicals — notably those critical of Trump — were likely dismayed by the allegations against Moore. “For them, the defense of Moore is another sign that both evangelicalism and the GOP have lost their credibility and their souls in the pursuit of power,” she wrote. AP Religion Writer Rachel Zoll in New York contributed to this report. Left:

pbs,"Nov 12, 2017 9:44 AM EST",Texas governor wants to double state guard in wake of Harvey," The Republican said at a Veteran’s Day rally in Austin that if re-elected next year, he’ll seek to expand the Texas State Guard to 5,000 volunteer members. He said it would make Texas better equipped to handle the next disaster. Expandin the state guard to that size would amount to a major surge in the volunteer unit, which unlike the Texas National Guard, can’t be deployed beyond state lines and doesn’t carry firearms. Abbott, who is up for re-election in 2018, is making a more robust state guard one of his earliest visions of a second term. Few if any U.S. governors are better positioned entering next year’s midterm elections: Abbott has yet to attract a credible challenger, and Democrats seem uneager to take on an incumbent who won by 20 points in 2014 and has $40 million socked away. Harvey killed more than 80 people and has been Abbott’s biggest test as governor. In the days after the Category 4 storm made landfall and dumped a record 50-plus inches of rain on Houston — leaving swaths of the nation’s fourth-largest city underwater — Abbott activated more than 12,000 members combined from the state guard and Texas National Guard. Beefing up the State Guard is part of a broader policy plan surrounding veterans and the military that Abbott is rolling out early in his re-election campaign. It includes plans to reduce homelessness among veterans and more access to mental health services. In 2015, the relatively obscure Texas State Guard received national attention after Abbott drew ridicule for ordering the guard to monitor a U.S. military training exercise known as “Jade Helm 15.” He did so amid Internet-fueled suspicions that the war simulation was really a hostile military takeover of Texas by the federal government. Abbott called the criticism overblown, saying at the time he was merely responding to citizen concerns and not legitimizing conspiracy theories. Left:

pbs,"Nov 11, 2017 4:25 PM EST",Harassment case puts U.S. Senate candidate under spotlight," Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Leon, the Democratic leader of the state Senate, heads the committee in charge of human resources employees who handle workplace complaints. De Leon also rents a room in the Sacramento home of Democratic Sen. Tony Mendoza, the man accused of improper conduct, de Leon spokesman Anthony Reyes said. Mendoza is accused of repeatedly inviting a young woman who worked in his office through a fellowship program to the house, although she never went. Mendoza said in a statement that he would never knowingly abuse his authority, though his statement didn’t address the allegation that he invited her to his home. De Leon said through spokesmen that he did not know about the complaint against Mendoza or his alleged invitations to the young woman. De Leon’s allies have downplayed the two senators’ relationship. But De Leon’s handling of impropriety at the Capitol will likely play a role in his U.S. Senate bid against Sen. Dianne Feinstein, one of California’s most prominent women in politics and a powerful U.S. senator. “It really does feel like we’re at this inflection point with sex harassment allegations where suddenly they’re being taken seriously,” said Kim Nalder, director of the Project for an Informed Electorate at California State University-Sacramento. “It’s hard to imagine that Kevin de Leon’s bid will be completely untarnished by this revelation that someone close to him was accused of this kind of misbehavior.” The latest allegations against Mendoza, which come after nearly 150 women signed a letter three weeks ago calling harassment pervasive in the capital culture, shed further light on the Senate’s murky processes for investigating its own members. After the initial outcry about harassment in mid-October, De Leon and Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon immediately pledged to review the Legislature’s policies. De Leon hired an outside investigator, and the Senate asked women to speak to her. De Leon said at the time that “everyone deserves a workplace free of fear, harassment and sexual misbehavior.” That statement was made before the allegations about Mendoza became public. A month earlier, the Senate began investigating Mendoza, Senate Secretary Danny Alvarez confirmed. A former employee of Mendoza’s complained to the Senate Rules Committee in September that the senator had repeatedly behaved inappropriately toward a young woman who worked for him through the Sacramento State fellows program, said Micha Liberty, a lawyer for the employee. That month, the employee and two others in Mendoza’s office were fired. The Senate and Liberty dispute the timing of the firings relative to the complaint. Mendoza and Alvarez said the firings had nothing to do with the complaints. Liberty, though, said her client made clear she was accusing Mendoza of sexual harassment toward the fellow, and she was forced to sign a confidentiality agreement when she was fired. Liberty would not name her client and did not provide a copy of the confidentiality letter. Mendoza said he did not know about the complaint until the he was contacted by the Sacramento Bee. A spokesman for the university, Brian Blomster, said the university did not know either. The Senate’s policy says the deputy secretary for human resources will meet with people named in complaints or those who may have knowledge, and will attempt to treat investigations as confidential. Alvarez did not directly answer a question about when, if ever, de Leon would be notified about an investigation in his role as head of the Senate Rules Committee. “As the process requires, the Senate will take action once Senate Rules completes their investigation,” he said. De Leon’s spokespeople declined to make him available for an interview with The Associated Press on allegations of Capitol harassment despite repeated requests, including on Friday. They did not answer Friday when asked if de Leon had spoken to Mendoza since news of the allegations against him broke or if he planned to strip Mendoza of his committee chairmanship. Mendoza heads the Senate Banking, Insurance and Financial Institutions Committee and sits on other key committees. De Leon campaign spokesman Roger Salazar pointed to his work on gender equity and fighting campus sexual assault as evidence of his record on women’s issues. “We’re not going to be able to stop people from being shameless in trying to play politics with this issue,” Salazar said. Feinstein’s allies, though, said the allegations at the Capitol will hurt de Leon. “De Leon is challenging a feminist icon,” said Nathan Ballard, a Democratic strategist backing Feinstein. “There is now a dark cloud of impropriety surrounding de Leon that won’t make him very popular with Sen. Feinstein’s base of Democratic women.” It’s hard to discern the full scope of sexual harassment allegations at the Capitol because lawmakers shield investigations from disclosure. The Senate and Assembly both rejected requests for information from the AP about how many sexual harassment investigations resulted in discipline since 2012, citing privacy concerns. The Senate reported that in that time it has investigated at least six sexual harassment complaints, although it’s unclear if that tally includes Mendoza. When complaints are resolved, employees who make them may never get documentation spelling out the results. Instead, the Deputy Secretary for Human Resources “will orally report the findings and conclusions to the employee,” according to the Senate harassment policy. Left:

pbs,"Nov 11, 2017 1:31 PM EST",Charlottesville unrest was a factor for many Virginia voters," The governor’s race was one of Virginia’s most racially charged in recent memory, and voters were peppered with ads that referenced the August violence. A political organization that mounted a months-long black voter outreach campaign surveyed minority voters, and most said they saw their vote as a way to push back against white supremacy. Some voters interviewed this week told The Associated Press the same thing. And in Charlottesville itself, which saw an increased voter turnout, one of the most vocal critics of the local government’s response to the rallies won a City Council seat. “I think folks really decided that it was important to send a message that the divisiveness is not something that Virginia stands for, and we really want to be an inclusive and welcoming state,” said Tram Nguyen, co-executive director of New Virginia Majority, a progressive group that worked on voter outreach in communities of color. However, John Whitbeck, chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia, said Democrats “had a message that we were a bunch of racists, and they just hammered it and hammered it and hammered it.” It will take months of talking with voters and elected officials to have a better understanding of what happened, he said. Democrats swept all three statewide races Tuesday, with Ralph Northam defeating Republican Ed Gillespie in the governor’s race by nearly 9 points. The party also has a shot at retaking control of the House of Delegates after picking up at least 15 seats. Three races that will determine control of the chamber were too close to call Saturday. The Rev. Seth Wispelwey, who was among the clergy facing down the white nationalists during the Aug. 12 protests, said people “had their consciences scandalized by this summer in Virginia.” He noted that in the House, a slew of conservative white men were replaced by “candidates who represent precisely who the white supremacists seek to dehumanize.” Among the new members of the House are at least 11 women, including Virginia’s first Latina and female Asian-American delegates. Danica Roem will be the state’s first transgender lawmaker, and Dawn Adams will be the first openly lesbian member in the House. Charlottesville became a rallying point for white nationalists when city leaders voted earlier this year to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from a local park. After white nationalist rallies in May and July, the biggest event was an August gathering dubbed “Unite the Right.” White nationalist groups and counterprotesters clashed violently in the street, and a car rammed into a crowd of counterprotesters, killing a woman and injuring others. Afterward, Trump asserted there were good people on “both sides” and bemoaned increasing efforts to remove Confederate monuments as an attack on America’s “history and culture.” READ NEXT: White supremacists once wore hoods. Now, an internet mob won’t let them stay anonymous BlackPAC, an organization that works to mobilize black voters, surveyed minority voters shortly after the Charlottesville events. The group says a majority of those surveyed felt “under attack” and wanted to send a message with their vote. The group used the findings to develop scripts for a canvassing program that sent people knocking on over 53,000 doors. The poll also helped shape the group’s ads, which focused on white supremacy, racism and Charlottesville, executive director Adrianne Shropshire said. Derek Gray, who lives in Ashburn and drives for Uber and Lyft, said this week that Trump’s remarks were part of why he voted for Northam. The white nationalist rallies and Trump’s response made him feel like “nobody else had a voice but the right-wing conservatives,” said Gray, who is African-American and gay. Jalane Schmidt, a local activist and associate professor of religious studies at the University of Virginia, said there’s also a clear link between the rallies and the election of Nikuyah Walker to the Charlottesville City Council. Walker, a Charlottesville native and an African American who works for the city’s parks and recreation department, has protested local leaders’ response to the rallies and campaigned in part on increasing government transparency. Turnout was higher than usual in Charlottesville. Preliminary figures showed 57.4 percent of registered voters cast a ballot. The general registrar and director of elections, Rosanna Bencoach, said that was the highest percentage in a nonpresidential election since at least 2000. In the governor’s race, Northam’s TV attacks on Gillespie focused more on his lobbying career than racial issues, but a Northam mailer lumped Gillespie in with the torch-wielding white supremacists at Charlottesville. It said Election Day was a chance to “stand up to hate.” Gillespie strongly condemned the white nationalist rally and pushed back against criticism that his ads were race-baiting. He made preserving Confederate statues a key campaign issue, though. Bruce Smith, a black 62-year-old Navy veteran, said he didn’t like that Gillespie echoed Trump’s position on keeping Confederate monuments, or his stance on issues like immigration. “(Gillespie) was basically talking like Trump. So when I heard that, I realized, this guy right here is a supporter of Trump’s nasty ways and bigoted ways,” said Smith. He voted only for Democrats Tuesday. Left:

pbs,"Nov 11, 2017 9:22 AM EST",Trump opposition inspires Dem focus on statehouse wins," They point to what just happened in Virginia, where Democrats rode a backlash against the president to sweeping victories. The surprise winners in House races include some first-time politicians who vowed never to take contributions from the state’s most powerful corporation. Together with Gov.-elect Ralph Northam’s win over the GOP’s Ed Gillespie, a former corporate lobbyist and Washington insider, and key wins in other state legislatures, the victories have lifted Democratic hopes of even more success in next year’s critical midterm elections. Opposition to Trump has inspired a new breed of independent-minded Democratic candidates, said Carolyn Fiddler, a longtime Democratic operative focused on state legislatures who now works at the liberal blog Daily Kos. “They are going to bring a very public-interest vision to governing, and they don’t have the deep corporate ties that establishment politicians have,” she said. “It’s going to change the way business is done in some of these state capitals.” Virginia’s CEOs, lobbyists, lawmakers and other powerbrokers are still scrambling to make sense of the election’s implications. Democrats won at least 15 seats in the House, all but erasing a business-friendly Republican majority that almost everyone assumed was safe. Democrats may even flip the chamber, depending on the outcome of three races that remained too close to call on Friday. The newly elected Democrats — 11 women among them — include the House’s first openly transgender lawmaker, its first Latina members, and its first female Asian-American. Thirteen of them have taken a pledge to reject any donations from a regulated utility such as Dominion Energy, Virginia’s most influential corporation and largest corporate political donor. The company has cultivated deep relationships with leaders in both parties, securing bipartisan support for laws boosting its bottom line. But critics have long complained that lawmakers are too cozy with the company. “I certainly intend to directly challenge their power over the General Assembly,” said Lee Carter, an IT specialist, Marine veteran and member of the Democratic Socialists of America who won a surprise victory Tuesday. He said Dominion is one of several corporate interests that will “have to get used to a new way of doing things.” Dominion spokesman David Botkins said the company is “looking forward to getting to know the new members and working together” on energy issues. Virginia’s largely unregulated campaign finance system has fostered strong ties between lawmakers in both parties and the businesses they regulate. An examination by The Associated Press in 2016 found a handful of lawmakers, including senior members in both parties, rely almost entirely on business interests and their representatives for campaign contributions. READ NEXT: Democrats dissect election results and find big dose of good news Virginia also doesn’t prohibit lawmakers from spending from their campaign accounts for personal use, and many lawmakers rely on corporate donations to subsidize their official office budgets. Northam has said he wants to limit corporate money in elections and ban personal use of campaign funds. Carter defeated Jackson Miller, a GOP House leader whose list of top donors reads like a who’s who of corporate influence, including Dominion, Realtor groups, bankers, hospitals and car dealers. Many of the other defeated Republicans got their campaign cash from similar sources. Democratic state Sen. Chap Petersen, a fierce Dominion critic, sees a new era at the General Assembly. “We have a new legislature that is reform minded, which is not beholden to the large corporate interests,” he said. Whether that vision gets dashed after the opening of January’s session remains to be seen. Republicans still control the state Senate, and Democratic legislators have yet to resolve many of the tensions over corporate influence on their party that played out between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders in last year’s presidential race. Democratic Senate Minority Leader Dick Saslaw said the General Assembly will remain a place that supports industries of all kinds, regardless of the election outcome. “That’s not going to change, because we’re a pro-business state,” he said.

pbs,N/A,News Wrap: Political fallout continues over Roy Moore report," The firestorm surrounding Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore has grown wider. It stems from allegations published yesterday in The Washington Post that Moore engaged in sexual misconduct with minors. The national Republican Senatorial Committee today moved to end its fund-raising agreement with the candidate, ahead of the December 12 election. When asked in a radio interview whether he remembered dating young girls, Moore said — quote — “Not generally.” He also flatly denied inappropriate interactions with a 14-year-old, as The Post had reported. Roy Moore: It never happened, and I don’t even like hearing it because it never happened. And they’re doing this a month away. They’re bringing it up because it’s political. It’s a direct attack on this campaign. And it involves a 14-year-old girl, which I would have never had any contact with, nothing with her mother, or in a courthouse or anywhere else, would I have done that. Judy Woodruff: The Washington Post reported the accuser has voted Republican in the past few presidential elections. Also today, Alabama’s Republican governor was asked if she found the account of Moore’s female accusers trustworthy. She responded, “Why wouldn’t it be?” Gov. Kay Ivey: These allegations are deeply disturbing. I will withhold judgment until we get the facts. People of Alabama deserve to know the truth. And then they will make their discussions. Judy Woodruff: Also today, Utah’s GOP Senator Mike Lee asked for his image to be removed from Moore’s fund-raising pitches. In another revelation coming in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal, Olympic gymnast Aly Raisman says she is among the young women sexually abused by a former physician with USA Gymnastics. The three-time Olympic gold medalist told “60 Minutes” on CBS she was 15 when she was first treated by Dr. Larry Nassar. He is awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty to child pornography charges. We will take a closer look at the constant drip of sexual misconduct allegations right after the news summary. President Trump again made clear his America first vision at a summit of world leaders in Vietnam today. The president railed against global trade practices that he said have disadvantaged Americans for decades. He said the U.S. won’t enter into any more large trade agreements, and repeated claims that past U.S. leaders were to blame for making bad deals. President Donald Trump: I do not blame China, or any other country, of which there are many, for taking advantage of the United States on trade. If their representatives are able to get away with it, they are just doing their jobs. Judy Woodruff: Later, President Trump came face to face with Russia’s President Vladimir Putin. The two were expected to hold a formal meeting on the sidelines of the summit, but it didn’t happen. Mr. Trump did shake hands and exchange a few words with Putin as they stood side by side for pictures with other leaders. Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi may now be in a town in Eastern Syria. A media outlet linked to the Syrian military says he’s holed up in an area near the Iraqi border that was partly recaptured by government forces this week. Syrian opposition activists denied the claim, and the U.S.-led anti-ISIS coalition says that it had — quote — “no releasable information” on Baghdadi’s whereabouts. There were new questions today about Lebanon’s prime minister, who announced his resignation this week in a televised address from Saudi Arabia. Saad Hariri today denied that he is being held as a prisoner in Riyadh. But the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah disputed that claim, saying that the Saudis forced him to resign. The group’s leader called for Hariri’s return. Hassan Nasrallah: (Through interpreter) Lebanon’s prime minister is detained in Saudi Arabia, and it has to release him. The Lebanese should work to bring him back to Lebanon, and then it is up to him to go wherever. Maybe he wants to go back to Saudi. It is his call. Judy Woodruff: Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said that Hariri should return to Lebanon to make his resignation official. He also said that Lebanon shouldn’t be used as a venue for the region’s proxy conflicts. The special counsel’s Russia investigation is said to be taking aim at possible dealings between ex-National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and Turkey. The Wall Street Journal says that Robert Mueller is probing an alleged plan to give Flynn millions of dollars in exchange for his help in forcibly returning a Muslim cleric from the U.S. to Turkey. Flynn’s lawyer denied the report. It has also been widely reported that Mueller’s team has interviewed White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller. The government says more than 600,000 Americans signed up for health coverage in the first week of this year’s Affordable Care Act open enrollment period. That puts sign-ups at least on track with previous years, despite President Trump’s claims that Obamacare is collapsing. Some 77 percent of those consumers were renewing their coverage. And on Wall Street today, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 39 points to close at 23422. The Nasdaq rose a less than a point, and the S&amp;P 500 dropped two. For the week, all three indices fell a fraction of a percent. Watch the Full Episode Nov 10 By PBS NewsHour Support Provided By:

pbs,N/A,"Shields and Brooks on Roy Moore’s political future, Democrats’ Virginia victory"," Even with President Trump in Asia, there was no shortage of political stories at home, as voters took to polls in several states, an Alabama Senate candidate became embroiled in a sexual scandal, and Republican senators revealed details of a tax plan they see as a must-pass. And to the analysis of Shields and Brooks. That’s syndicated columnist Mark Shields and New York Times columnist David Brooks. Welcome, gentlemen. And what a difference 24 hours makes when it comes to Roy Moore. David Brooks, we didn’t know about this, I guess, a little more than 24 hours ago. Now we do, these accusations that he, as a young man in his early 30s, was with several young women, including one 14 years old. He today is denying all this. He says it’s a political smear, but, just in the last hour, we have learned that two Republicans senators have withdrawn their endorsement, Mike Lee of Utah, Steve Daines of Montana. Can he survive this? David Brooks: I don’t think so, not — I don’t think he can be seated. He can survive. You think you have lost your capacity to be disgusted by what goes on in this country. And this, it should be said first, is a very credible, well-sourced story. The people didn’t come out of the woodwork. The women who are the accusers were pulled out and interviewed and finally consented to give their stories. So, it seems to be quite a credible story. And what’s disgusting is not only his behavior, alleged behavior, in those incidents, but the actual behavior of a lot of Republicans in Alabama these days, who are either casting it off as no big deal, or giving the excuse, well, in the Bible, Joseph and Mary had a relationship, and Mary was a teenager. One doesn’t even know where to begin that kind of excuse. And so, suddenly, this of sort of stuff is tolerated because our party has to win and beat the other party. And so this is the ultimate test of conscience for the Republican Party. Most of the Washington Republican Party — Republicans are passing that test, but, in Alabama, maybe not, and maybe they can keep him in the race. Judy Woodruff: It is the case, Mark, most Alabama Republicans are defending him. Now, the governor, we heard her a few minutes ago. She is saying what these allegations are, they seem credible. Mark Shields: They seem credible. And Richard Shelby, the senior Republican senator from Alabama, uncharacteristically, came to the microphone yesterday to address them as serious charges, and was part of the chorus of Republican senators who were certainly quite serious about the Washington Post story, and treated it seriously, and suggested that Roy Moore would be better leaving. But I think, Judy, when you look at this, it just stands as a stark contrast, what’s happened. David said our team vs. the other team, how deeply that has changed in just six or seven years. There was a congressman from New York named Chris Lee. He was a Republican congressman in a safe Republican district upstate. And he was exposed as showing a bare above-the-waist photo of himself online to a woman he had met on Craigslist, and passing himself off as a 39-year-old divorced lobbyist, instead of a married congressman. One hour later, one hour later, after meeting with John Boehner, he resigned from the Congress. I mean, that was — there was a sense then that that was wrong, it was unacceptable. These same Republicans who are now springing to his defense, especially the conservatives in the press, rightly went after Anthony Weiner for sexting and sending sexual materials online to women, teenagers, inappropriately, illegally, and he’s paying for it. Never once did he allegedly touch any of them or undress any of them or take them to his apartment. And that’s what Roy Moore — these are serious. And, today — we went from fake news yesterday from Roy Moore to, today, didn’t generally, as a 30-something attorney, date teenagers. And, you know, so I just think — I think this thing is headed very south in a big hurry for the Republicans in a bad way. Judy Woodruff: Do you see this as a test somehow for Republicans, David? David Brooks: Yes, I think it’s a test for Republicans, especially in this regard. This is a predicate for what — when — if Bob Mueller comes with charges to Donald Trump, he’s going to say, fake news, fake news, fake news. And that’s more or less what a lot of people in the Trumpian movement are doing. No fact is fact. A fact they don’t like is just fake news. And if The Washington Post, with a very well-sourced story, can’t be can be believed and can be just dismissed as fake news, then everything can be dismissed as fake news, and we have lost all sense of reality, basically. And so I think the party not only to behavior about harassment has to show some spine, but on the basic respect for truth, if we can’t have some basic respect for evidence, we really do not have a democracy. And that’s what’s ultimately at stake here. Judy Woodruff: And that brings up, Mark, what — so much else of what we have seen in the political climate of the last year and more. Mark Shields: No, it does. And the charge — I think David makes a good point and a solid point. I mean, we have to have an agreed-upon — to have any kind of a debate and dialogue in a democracy, we have to agree on facts, and that — and if something comes from a source that I don’t like, I just can’t reject it, if in fact — and this is a well-sourced story by The Washington Post. And it is — you know, it’s serious. Judy Woodruff: And as we — I think we reported a few minutes ago, too, The Post also reported, the woman who made these — one was 14 years old at the time… Mark Shields: Yes. Judy Woodruff: … The Post has reported she voted Republican in the last few elections, voted for Donald Trump. Mark Shields: Yes. Judy Woodruff: So, it’s harder to make the case that this is a Democratic smear. Mark Shields: Yes. Judy Woodruff: So, David, I guess you could argue this has not been a good week for Republicans, looking back to the Tuesday elections across the country, but mainly those governor’s races in New Jersey and especially in Virginia. What’s the lesson are Republicans to take from this, because we’re hearing different analyses of this? David Brooks: Yes, I take attack the maximalist position. When you have an unpopular president, of course, his party is the more likely to lose elections in an off-term election. But this to me is much deeper. We’re in a moment of historical transition. The fundamental tectonics are changing in our politics. And, to me, the two big things that happened in especially the Virginia race was that it used to be, on the outer rings of a lot of suburbs, you had a lot of people who worked in office parks, or worked for corporations, generally pro-capitalist. They tend to be Republican. And this time, those sorts of people voted for the Democrats by tremendous majorities. There’s a county — one of the fastest and richest, growing counties in the country called Loudoun County, which is out past Dulles Airport. That was a pro-Bush county. It went for the Democrats this time 60-40, by landslide proportions. And that’s going to be happen all around the country. And that’s just devastating for Republicans around the country. The second thing that leapt out at me was the youth vote. Young people under 28 voted the Democrats 69-30. That’s a gigantic proportion — 28-44 almost as big a proportion. So, you’re basically losing the future by epic proportions. And what the Republican Party has done, if this continues, is they have basically shrunk their coalition to an unsustainable size in a lot of states. Judy Woodruff: How do you look at the Tuesday results? Mark Shields: Let me just add two things to David’s diagnosis, which I found penetrating and perceptive. (LAUGHTER) Mark Shields: And that… Judy Woodruff: That’s a compliment, I think. Mark Shields: Yes, it is. After eight months, I thought I should give him one. (LAUGHTER) Mark Shields: But, no, I think, Judy, when anybody wins a national election the way Donald Trump did, I mean, it was a unique form — nobody had ever won that way before. And everybody in politics kind of looked, and they were nervous. They said, is this the new form? Do you have to be bombastic? I mean, do you have to use locker room or bar room language and engage in feuds, and you got to be that kind of colorful and dominate the news constantly? The man who won in Virginia was the ultimate non-Trump. Ralph Northam is a physician, eight years, VMI graduate, Virginia Military Institute, eight years in the Army, married to Pam, an elementary school teacher, colorless. Judy Woodruff: Said he voted for George Bush. Mark Shields: Voted for George Bush, nonbombastic, and earnest. And he won a bigger victory, he won by a margin three times larger than Barack Obama carried Virginia. I mean, it was that impressive. And he won across the board. So, I think, when you look at the Virginia results, there is one number that jumps out. Democrats, it has become a blue state. Democrats have not lost a statewide election in Virginia since 2009. That’s across the board, with all the constitutional offices and president and Senate. But Republicans, because they won in 2009 and controlled the redistricting process, drew the legislature seats, gerrymandered, so there were 66 Republican seats and 34 Democrats. On last Tuesday, the Democrats went in, and they won at least 15 and maybe — there’s still three to be decided — they may have won a majority. So they took that many seats away from seats that had been drawn for Republicans. That was because D was next to their name and R was next to the Republican name. That was Trump. That was energy, it was passion and all the rest, and good people. But, I mean, it really reflected that Donald Trump had become an albatross for the Republican candidates. Judy Woodruff: Well, speaking of that, David, the White House and Steve Bannon, their former chief strategist, are saying the mistake that Ed Gillespie, the Republican, made was not embracing Donald Trump enough. That was what the president himself said — He didn’t embrace me enough. So, what’s the message for Republican candidates this year? David Brooks: Yes, well, they weren’t watching the campaign, I believe. They are essentially arguing that Ed Gillespie would have won if he had had even more commercials about the Confederate statues, he would have won college-educated women voters if he emphasized the MS-13 gang even more. It’s just not plausible. He ran a pretty Trumpian campaign. It was all over the press. And in the days when he — in the final days, where he seemed to be gaining, the story from Bannon world was that he was embracing Trump, and it’s totally a winning strategy. So, again, they sort of dump people who are losers pretty fast. I would issue one word of caution. The Republicans are shrinking, but are we necessarily in for an era of Democratic dominance? I think it is worth pointing out that I do think that they had a good candidate, or moderately good candidate, but this wasn’t a victory the Democrats earned. This was the Republicans handing them a big slice of the electorate. And, to me, what’s happened, because of these elections, is the most interesting story in politics is not what the Republicans are doing. It’s how the Democrats react to this opportunity. Do they become a party that extends outward and seizes the ground that the Republicans are seemingly ceding them, or do they retreat and just go back to their base? What you’re seeing around the world is not left-wing dominance. It’s the collapse of all parties. And we could begin to see that too. Judy Woodruff: How do you think Democrats are going to respond? What do we know? Mark Shields: I hope that they don’t start imposing litmus tests. I hope that they believe in coalition politics. If we agree, 80 percent of us, then that’s all you really need to be a political party. You can see the signs from people like Tom Steyer, the billionaire environmentalist, who is imposing, you have to believe this, and if you don’t believe that, or you don’t believe in a universal national payer health insurance… Judy Woodruff: Calling for the impeachment of… (CROSSTALK) Mark Shields: Yes, calling for the impeachment of the presidency, calling that you have to be totally, absolutely pro-choice without any qualms. The fact is, Judy, that the Democrats do have an opportunity. And they had a great victory. The Republicans have retreated. The Republicans in Virginia are on the verge of becoming like the Republicans in California, a party that is unwelcoming and openly hostile to people who aren’t white. And you’re seeing what has happened. But I will say this. There are 9.2 million Americans who voted in 2016 for Donald Trump who had voted for Barack Obama. And the Democrats have to address and speak to these people, to their anxieties, to their economic stagnation, and to their well-being, and not simply play to the people who are disaffected right from Donald Trump right now. Judy Woodruff: And just quickly, David, are Democrats doing that yet? Are they doing it at all? David Brooks: Not so much. I think the party, if you look at the fundamentals, how they think about the world, the Democratic Party has shifted very sharply to the left, in fact, further left than their policies have. So one would expect the shift to the Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren direction to continue. And that will be a challenge for a lot of people who are living in the Loudoun County I mentioned. Judy Woodruff: Democrats doing what you… (CROSSTALK) Mark Shields: I think the test is coming in 2018. In the recruitment of candidates, I would have to say they’re doing a good job. And they did a good job in Virginia to find candidates who match and are comfortable and congenial with the voters they’re seeking to represent. One shout-out. Tom Perriello, who lost the Democratic primary to Ralph Northam, former congressman, was a liberal alternative to Northam in the primary, could have sulked, could have gone away. He spent al his time, effort and energy working with those legislative candidates, recruiting them, helping them. And if the Democrats win a majority, he deserves a little credit. Judy Woodruff: Helping his party. I’m going to give you both a credit. Mark Shields, David Brooks, thank you both.

pbs,"Nov 10, 2017 5:18 PM EST","Moore refuses to quit Alabama Senate race, as GOP sees seat at risk"," Moore, an outspoken Christian conservative and former state Supreme Court judge, attacked a Washington Post report that he had sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl and pursued three other teenagers decades earlier as “completely false and misleading.” In an interview with conservative radio host Sean Hannity, he did not wholly rule out dating teenage girls when he was in his early 30s. Asked if that would have been usual for him, Moore said, “Not generally, no.” He added: “I don’t remember ever dating any girl without the permission of her mother.” As for the encounter with 14-year-old Leigh Corfman, as described by Corfman in Thursday’s Post article, he said, “It never happened.” The story has produced a wave of concern among anxious GOP officials in Washington but little more than a collective shrug from many Republicans in Alabama, which holds a special election on Dec. 12 to fill the seat previously held by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. “Humphrey Bogart started dating Lauren Bacall when she was a teenager,” said state Auditor Jim Ziegler, referring to the then-19-year-old actress. “I’ll always vote for him,” said 28-year-old Erica Richard, of Altoona, Alabama, adding that she wouldn’t change her mind even if the allegations of sexual misconduct are proven true. “He’s a good man. I love him and his family, and they are all good people.” Paul Reynolds, Alabama’s Republican National Committeeman, called it “a firestorm designed to shipwreck a campaign in Alabama. I think it’s sinister.” Despite such support, experienced Republican operatives believe the Alabama Senate seat, held by the GOP for the last 20 years, is now at risk. They fear the controversy could exacerbate the party’s broader Trump-era challenge in appealing to college-educated suburban voters — the same group that fueled a big Democratic victory in the Virginia governor’s race this week. Those familiar with recent polling of the Alabama race suggest it was always going to be close despite the state’s strong Republican leanings — largely because of Moore’s controversial past. In the immediate aftermath of the Post report Thursday, a wave of national Republican leaders called for Moore to drop out of the race if the allegations are true. They included the White House, the head of the House Freedom Caucus Mark Meadows, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. It got worse Friday. The Senate GOP’s campaign arm formally ended its fundraising agreement with Moore. The GOP’s 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney condemned his colleagues’ caveat — only if the allegations are true. “Innocent until proven guilty is for criminal convictions, not elections. I believe Leigh Corfman,” he said of the Alabama woman who said Moore molested her when she was 14. “Her account is too serious to ignore. Moore is unfit for office and should step aside.” Facing a tough re-election, Rep. Barbara Comstock, R-Va., likened Moore to Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, former Rep. Anthony Weiner and former Fox News executive Roger Ailes, all men accused of sexual misconduct. “The defense from some of his supporters is beyond disgusting,” Comstock wrote. “Moore should not serve in the U.S. Senate.” Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, withdrew his endorsement after reading “the detailed description of the incidents, as well as the response from Judge Moore and his campaign.” Having read the detailed description of the incidents, as well as the response from Judge Moore and his campaign, I can no longer endorse his candidacy for the US Senate. — Mike Lee (@SenMikeLee) November 10, 2017  Yet there is no sign Moore is going away quietly. And the Alabama secretary of state’s office reported that it’s too late to remove his name from the ballot. The Republican Party’s options, including the possibility of a write-in campaign, “are all being researched,” said Steven Law, who leads the pro-Republican Senate Leadership Fund. Those who think Moore should be replaced have little hope of that happening. “I don’t think anyone expects Roy Moore to drop out of this race,” Law said. “I think he enjoys being an object of intense controversy. The fact that this has happened may make him even more committed.” Moore was twice removed from his state Supreme Court position, once for disobeying a federal court order to remove a 5,200-pound granite Ten Commandments monument from the lobby of the state judicial building, and later for urging state probate judges to defy the U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized gay marriage. He also previously said homosexuality should be illegal, and last week he refused to back off comments that Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., should not be allowed to serve in Congress because he’s a Muslim. Virtually the entire Republican establishment — including President Donald Trump — opposed Moore’s primary bid in September. In Friday’s radio interview, Moore cast the Post story as an effort by Democrats — “and maybe even establishment Republicans” — to undermine his campaign. He also mentioned an effort to investigate his accusers. “We’re also doing an investigation and we have some evidence of some collusion here, but we’re not ready to put that to the public just yet,” he said without elaboration. Democrats, meanwhile, were quietly stepping up their mobilization efforts in Alabama, though being careful not to publicly ignite partisan backlash by attempting to capitalize on the troubling allegations. Democratic candidate Doug Jones stood to capitalize in places where Moore had shown weakness in past statewide elections. Some Republicans conceded that Moore would likely suffer in the state’s reliably, mainstream-Republican suburbs. In Shelby and Baldwin counties — suburban Birmingham and Mobile — Moore ran more than a dozen percentage points behind Romney in his 2012 bid for the Alabama Supreme Court. “It’s a bad situation,” said Henry Barbour, a Republican National Committeeman from neighboring Mississippi. “Do people find it believable? If they do, he will lose.” Peoples reported from New York. Associated Press writers Alan Fram in Washington, Thomas Beaumont in Des Moines, Iowa, and Brynn Anderson in Altoona contributed to this report. Left:

pbs,"Nov 10, 2017 1:23 PM EST","Deal with Russia on Syria’s future is near, U.S. officials say"," If clinched, the deal could have been announced by President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin after a meeting in Vietnam, U.S. officials said. But White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Friday that they won’t hold a formal meeting due to scheduling conflicts on “both sides.” Still, Sanders said it was possible Trump and Putin could have a less formal encounter while in Vietnam. The United States has been reluctant to hold a formal meeting between the leaders unless they have a substantive agreement to announce. The potential understanding comes as an array of forces are near a final defeat of IS, the extremist group that once controlled vast stretches of both Iraq and Syria. Fighting the group is no longer top priority, shifting the focus back to Syria’s intractable conflict between President Bashar Assad’s government and rebels — and to concerns that foreign powers such as Iran will now dominate the country’s future. The U.S.-Russian agreement being discussed would focus on three elements, officials said: “deconfliction” between the U.S. and Russian militaries, reducing violence in the civil war and reinvigorating U.N.-led peace talks. The officials weren’t authorized to discuss the deliberations and requested anonymity. The U.S. and Russian militaries have maintained a “deconfliction” hotline for years to avoid unintended collisions and even potential confrontations as they each operate in Syria’s crowded skies. A heavy air campaign by Russia has been credited with shoring up the position of Assad, a close ally of Moscow. With IS nearing defeat, the U.S. and Russia are losing their common enemy in Syria and will remain in a proxy battle in which Russia backs Assad and the U.S. lends at least rhetorical support to armed opposition groups fighting the government. That has increased the need for close communication between the two powers about where their forces are operating at any given time, officials said. The agreement also seeks to build on progress in establishing “de-escalation zones” in Syria that have calmed some parts of the country. In July, when Trump held his first meeting with Putin in Germany, the U.S. and Russia announced a deal that included Jordan and established a cease-fire in southwest Syria. The United States has said that cease-fire has largely held and could be replicated elsewhere in the country. A key U.S. concern, shared by close ally Israel, is the presence of Iranian-backed militias in Syria that have exploited the vacuum of power. The United States and Israel have been seeking ways to prevent forces loyal to Iran — Israel’s archenemy — from establishing a permanent presence. One idea hinges on a “buffer zone” along Israel’s border with Syria. A third element of the deal would reaffirm support for the United Nations effort being run out of Geneva to seek a political transition in Syria and resolve the civil war. The United States and Russia have been at odds for years over whether Assad could be allowed to remain in power in a future Syrian government. The U.N. talks, which have come in fits and starts without yielding significant progress, aren’t the only discussions about Syria’s future. Russia, Turkey and Iran have been brokering their own process in Astana, Kazakhstan. The U.S. views those talks warily because of Iran’s involvement, though they’ve led to local cease-fire deals that have reduced violence, too. “We believe that the Geneva process is the right way to go,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said Thursday. “Unfortunately, it is a long way off, but we’re getting a little bit closer.” The U.S.-Russia deal may also seek to expand the mandate of a joint “monitoring center” established this year in Amman, Jordan, to watch for cease-fire violations and other developments on the ground. It has focused on southwest Syria, where the cease-fire is in place, but could be used to monitor broader stretches of the country. Although Moscow has sought a formal meeting between Trump and Putin while both are in Vietnam this week, the U.S. hasn’t committed to such a meeting. Washington’s concern is that it would not serve U.S. interests unless there’s progress between the countries to announce — on Syria or something else. Putin’s aides have said a meeting will likely occur Friday and that the time, place and format are being worked out between the governments. “We have been in contact with them, and the view has been if the two leaders are going to meet, is there something sufficiently substantive to talk about that would warrant a formal meeting?” Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Thursday in Beijing.

But Sanders says: “The president also believes that if these allegations are true, Judge Moore will do the right thing and step aside.” The Washington Post reported Thursday that an Alabama woman said Moore had sexual contact with her when she was 14 and he was a 32-year-old assistant district attorney. The Moore campaign denied the report as “the very definition of fake news and intentional defamation.” Left:

pbs,"Nov 10, 2017 11:29 AM EST",UNESCO chief says U.S. ’empty chair’ can’t last," Following her confirmation Friday as director general, Azoulay acknowledged difficulties in the Paris-based organization that has been rocked by U.S. funding cuts since 2011 over the admission of Palestine as a member. But the 45-year-old former French culture minister told The Associated Press that the Trump administration’s announcement to pull out of the agency is not tenable in the long term. “I obviously regret their departure … but this ’empty chair politics’ is not sustainable because the United States is also affected by everything that UNESCO does,” she said, speaking at the agency’s Paris headquarters. The U.N.’s educational, scientific and cultural agency is best known for its World Heritage program to protect cultural sites and traditions, but it also works to fight violent extremism, improve education for girls, promote Holocaust understanding, defend media freedoms and encourage science on climate change. Azoulay, who will be officially sworn in Monday, said the American withdrawal “did not come as a surprise” given the “critical position” the U.S. has taken recently — a reference to President Donald Trump’s “America First” policies. Azoulay said she will maintain a dialogue with the U.S., which plans to remain as a “permanent observer.” The U.S. stopped funding UNESCO after it voted to include Palestine in 2011, but the State Department has maintained a UNESCO office and sought to weigh in on policy behind the scenes. The U.S. now owes about $550 million in back payments. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that Israel also plans to withdraw from the agency. Israel has been irked by resolutions that diminish its historical connection to the Holy Land and have named ancient Jewish sites as Palestinian heritage sites. Israel told The AP it planned to pull out of the agency this month. There have been hopes that Azoulay, the organization’s first Jewish chief who is also of Moroccan descent, would be able to quell the political tempest inside the organization that was created following World War II to promote peace. “I have multiple identities. An identity built on multiplicity, built on diversity. And I have experienced in my life how much of an opportunity that is — how much in today’s modern world this complexity and diversity is an asset,” she said. She warned against writing UNESCO off. “It’s prejudicial to UNESCO to reduce its scope of work to a few hotbeds of tensions,” she said. “We are always stronger with multilateral dialogue. It’s as true for Israel as it is for other countries.” UNESCO’s Executive Board nominated Azoulay their next chief after an unusually heated election overshadowed by Mideast tensions. The choice was confirmed Friday by the General Conference who voted 131-19 to appoint her. She will be UNESCO’s second female chief after outgoing leader Irina Bokova and its second French chief. While she is Jewish, her father is Moroccan and was an influential adviser to Moroccan kings, so she also has a connection to the Arab world.

pbs,"Nov 10, 2017 11:10 AM EST",WATCH: Trump says U.S. will no longer ‘be taken advantage of anymore’ on trade," “From this day forward we will compete on a fair and equal basis,” Trump told a gathering of CEOs on the sidelines of the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Vietnam. “We are not going to let the United States be taken advantage of anymore. I am always going to put America first. It was a striking change of tone from the day before, in China, where Trump had taken a friendlier approach toward the country as he sought to establish a more balanced trade relationship. At issue during the lead-up of the trip: Whether the president would have a formal sit-down with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump had said it was expected, but the White House later said a formal meeting was not planned due to scheduling conflicts. The two leaders shook hands and greeted each other before a dinner Friday night, according to video of the event. In his speech, Trump told executives gathered in the coastal city of Danang that he was happy to enter into bilateral trading agreements with any of the nations in the Indo-Pacific region — but only if they are reciprocal and fair. “What we will no longer do is enter into large agreements that tie our hands, surrender our sovereignty, and make meaningful enforcement practically impossible,” Trump said. As one of his first acts as president, Trump rejected the far-reaching Pacific Rim trade pact known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, disappointing many nations in the region, including the summit’s host, Vietnam. Leaders of the 11 remaining TPP members, representing roughly 13.5 percent of the global economy, were scheduled to meet on the sidelines of the APEC summit to seek an agreement in principle that would not require U.S. involvement. But the prospects of that deal appeared in doubt Friday, as a meeting of the leaders of 11 countries still involved in the pact was delayed. There was no word on whether they had given up reaching agreement in Danang or were still working toward an agreement on how to move forward without U.S. involvement. Trump also took aim at what he described as abusive trade practices he said had “hurt many people in our country.” He described “jobs, factories and industries” being “stripped out of the United States and out of many countries” as a result. Without singling out China by name, Trump argued the U.S. had adhered to World Trade Organization principles, only to be taken advantage of by counties that had ignored the rules and engaged in harmful practices such as product dumping, currency manipulation and government subsidizing of goods. “We can no longer tolerate these chronic trade abuses and we will not tolerate them,” he said. President Donald Trump is welcomed by his Vietnamese counterpart Tran Dai Quang and his wife Nguyen Thi Hien for the gala dinner of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit in Danang, Vietnam. Photo by  VNA/via Reuters In the speech, Trump said he had spoken “openly and directly” with Chinese President Xi Jinping during his visit about “about China’s unfair trade practices and the enormous trade deficits they have produced with the United States.” Trump said China’s trade surplus, which stood at $223 billion for the first 10 months of the year, was unacceptable, and repeated his language from Thursday when he said he did “not blame China” or any other country “for taking advantage of the United States on trade.” But Trump went on to say that the U.S. would “no longer turn a blind eye to violations, cheating or economic aggression.” “We will no longer tolerate the audacious theft of intellectual property. We will confront the destructive practices of forcing businesses to surrender their technology to the state and forcing them into joint ventures in exchange for market access. We will address the massive subsidizing of industries through colossal state-owned enterprises that put private competitors out of business, all the time,” he said. All are allegations the U.S. has lodged against China. Xi followed Trump to the microphone but in Danang did not directly respond to Trump’s claims of trade unfairness toward the U.S. Trump also continued to talk tough against North Korea and its development of nuclear and ballistic missiles weapons, as he has throughout the trip. “The future of this region and its beautiful people must not be held hostage to a dictator’s twisted fantasies of violent conquest and nuclear blackmail,” he said. APEC is the first of several summits Trump is scheduled to attend on his first official visit to Asia. It will be a change in pace the president, who has spent much of the week basking in elaborate welcome ceremonies and banquets between meetings with the leaders of Japan, South Korea and China.  Just miles from one of the world’s most dangerous borders, President Trump’s tone toward North Korea shifted from long-distance threats to “let’s make a deal,” suggesting at a press conference with the South Korean president that he sees signs that diplomacy could work. John Yang speaks with David Kang of the University of Southern California about the South Korean perception of Trump’s approach. Shortly before Trump landed, the White House announced he would not be having a formal meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, as Trump had said had been expected. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders blamed scheduling conflicts on both sides, but said it was possible the leaders could have a less formal encounter in Danang or at a later regional conference in the Philippines. Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said “there have been contradictory signals and we don’t have full understanding yet,” according to Russian news wires. But he added: “Both presidents are in town, and their paths will cross one way or another.” U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had told reporters in Beijing on Thursday that there was no reason to schedule a meeting if the U.S. and Russia are unable to make significant progress on issues including Syria and Ukraine. Both sides have been working to reach agreement on how they hope to resolve Syria’s civil war once the Islamic State group is defeated. The potential understanding comes as an array of forces are near a final defeat of IS, the extremist group that once controlled vast stretches of both Iraq and Syria. By Erica R. Hendry By Erica R.

pbs,"Nov 10, 2017 10:43 AM EST",Senate GOP proposes to delay major corporate tax cut a year," On the other side of the Capitol on Thursday, the House Ways and Means Committee approved its own version of the legislation on a party-line 24-16 vote, amid intense political pressure on the GOP to push forward on the first major rewrite of the U.S. tax code in three decades. It’s President Donald Trump’s top priority and a goal many Republicans believe has grown even more urgent in the wake of election losses on Tuesday that displayed an energized Democratic electorate. Yet as the Senate Finance Committee unveiled its bill, a few stark differences emerged with the version approved by the House tax-writing committee, underscoring the challenges ahead in getting both chambers to agree on the complex and far-reaching legislation that would affect nearly every American. The Senate measure fails to repeal the estate tax, though it doubles the size of estates exempted from the tax. It makes couples earning up to $1 million eligible for a $1,650 per-child tax credit. It creates a new 38.5 percent tax bracket for couples earning more than $1 million and individuals making more than $500,000 per year. And it takes a different approach to cutting taxes for businesses not organized as corporations that is less generous but applies to more businesses. Democrats are strongly opposed to the GOP rewrite, so the Republicans must find agreement among themselves to have any hope of passage. The Senate bill would fully repeal the state and local deduction claimed by many taxpayers, an idea that has drawn vigorous opposition from House Republicans in New York and New Jersey and resulted in a compromise in the House version of the bill that would allow property taxes to be deducted up to $10,000. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told The Associated Press that the Senate’s total-repeal approach would face tough sledding in his chamber. As for the hard-fought compromise, he said, “I think it’d be difficult not to have it in the final bill.” On the other hand, the House bill would lower the cap on the mortgage interest deduction, an idea that caused intense blowback from the real estate lobby, but the Senate tax measure would leave it unchanged. That means homebuyers would continue to be able to deduct interest payments on loans of up to $1 million as permitted under current law; the House bill would reduce the limit to $500,000 for new home purchases. The feverish efforts by Republicans in both chambers are aimed at fulfilling a self-imposed deadline to get legislation out of the House and Senate before Thanksgiving so the period between then and Christmas can be devoted to reconciling the two versions. But the Senate already seems unlikely to meet that deadline because of complex rules governing how it must consider the tax bill. In one provision sure to cause a major dispute, the Senate measure includes a one-year delay in lowering the corporate tax rate, which is to be cut from 35 percent to 20 percent. Delaying that reduction would lower the cost of the bill to the Treasury, but the delay is opposed by the White House and some Senate Republicans. “The president would like this to go into effect right away,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Thursday on Fox Business Network. Other obstacles remain, among them a band of deficit hawks in the Senate who are unhappy about the $1.5 trillion the legislation would add to the national debt over the coming decade. “I remain concerned over how the current tax reform proposals will grow the already staggering national debt by opting for short-term fixes while ignoring long-term problems,” said Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ala. “We must achieve real tax reform crafted in a fiscally responsible manner.” The House and Senate bills are broadly similar in their outlines. Both would drastically reduce the corporate tax rate and also lower rates for individuals, while eliminating deductions claimed by many people. The House version would collapse the current seven tax brackets into four, while the Senate would retain seven. The House bill would entirely eliminate the estate tax, while the Senate version would retain it while doubling the exemption level. Both versions would retain an adoption tax credit that had initially been eliminated in the House bill, but that adoption advocates fought to restore. Both would increase a child tax credit, though not to levels sought by Sens. Marco Rubio and others, an indication of how individual provisions will need to be negotiated with one lawmaker after another in the weeks to come. House Republicans appear on track to pass their version of the bill next week, but in the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has a slim 52-48 majority that has proven difficult to corral. Democrats are angrily opposed to the GOP rewrite, arguing it’s a giveaway to the rich and corporate America. Republicans contend that the tax reductions will help the middle class, even though some independent analyses have found that the wealthy and corporations benefit disproportionately. The tax bill must deepen federal deficits by no more than $1.5 trillion over the coming decade. If Republicans don’t meet that, the measure would be vulnerable to a bill-killing Senate filibuster by Democrats that GOP senators lack the votes to block. It also cannot add to red ink beyond the first 10 years without facing the same fate. Associated Press writers Alan Fram and Erica Werner contributed to this report. Left:

pbs,"Nov 10, 2017 9:02 AM EST",How sexual allegations against Roy Moore could transform the Alabama Senate race," Yet in the span of a tumultuous afternoon, a low-profile special election became a Republican nightmare that threatens a once-safe Senate seat — and offers a new window into ugly divisions that continue to plague the GOP in the age of President Donald Trump. Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore, a 70-year-old former state Supreme Court justice, defiantly denied allegations of decades-old sexual misconduct with minors published Thursday in a Washington Post story. The revelations, a month before the Dec. 12 special election, triggered a sharp backlash from would-be Republican colleagues on Capitol Hill, who called on Moore to quit the race if the allegations were true. It was a bittersweet moment for some in the Republican establishment who argued that Moore, a Christian culture warrior twice removed from his state’s Supreme Court for judicial misconduct, never should have been the party’s Senate nominee in the first place. Some blamed Steve Bannon, Trump’s former senior strategist, who broke from most GOP leaders — including Trump himself — by cheering Moore’s candidacy earlier in the year. “Dear GOP, send your thank you cards to the Breitbart embassy attn: Steve Bannon,” tweeted a sarcastic Josh Holmes, a former aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Dear GOP, send your thank you cards to the Breitbart embassy attn: Steve Bannon https://t.co/DZ7XmKjK3l — Josh Holmes (@HolmesJosh) November 9, 2017  Moore is the latest soldier in Bannon’s self-described war on the Republican establishment. Frustrated that GOP leaders haven’t quickly executed Trump’s agenda, Bannon has vowed to defeat every Senate Republican up for re-election next year, save for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Bannon referenced Moore only briefly during an appearance Thursday night in New Hampshire, attacking The Washington Post — an “apparatus of the Democratic Party,” he called it — for also being among the first to report the “Access Hollywood” tape that caught Trump using sexual predatory language before the 2016 election. “The Bezos-Amazon-Washington Post that dropped that dime on Donald Trump, is the same Bezos-Amazon-Washington Post that dropped the dime this afternoon on Judge Roy Moore,” Bannon said. “Now is that a coincidence? That’s what I mean when I say ‘opposition party.'” The White House said Trump believes Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore “will do the right thing and step aside” if sexual misconduct allegations against him are true. Press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters traveling with Trump in Asia that the president believes a “mere allegation” — especially one from many years ago — shouldn’t be allowed to destroy a person’s life. But Sanders said: “The president also believes that if these allegations are true, Judge Moore will do the right thing and step aside.” Moore’s challenge in Alabama comes the same week that Republicans suffered sweeping election losses across several states, none more significant than Virginia, where Democrats seized the governor’s office and may have changed the balance of power in the state legislature. Across Washington, the calls from anxious Republicans for Moore to step aside if the allegations proved true grew as the hours passed on Thursday. They included Trump, McConnell and Cruz, House Freedom Caucus Chairman Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., and Alabama’s own senior senator, Richard Shelby. Moore showed no signs of going quietly, vowing in a fundraising message distributed in the midst of Thursday’s chaos to “NEVER GIVE UP the fight!” as he cast his struggle as a “spiritual battle.” It’s too late for Moore’s name to be removed from the ballot before the Dec. 12 special election even if he withdraws from the race, according to John Bennett, a spokesman for the Alabama secretary of state. A write-in campaign remains possible, Bennett added. Sen. Luther Strange, the Trump-backed interim senator who lost to Moore in a September primary contest, wouldn’t immediately say whether he’d re-enter the race. “Well, that’s getting the cart ahead of the horse. But I will have something to say about that. Let me do some more research,” Strange told The Associated Press. On the ground in Alabama, however, many responded with a collective shrug. “Take Joseph and Mary. Mary was a teenager and Joseph was an adult carpenter. They became parents of Jesus,” Alabama state Auditor Jim Ziegler told The Washington Examiner. Alabama resident Becky Ashley dismissed the situation as a ploy by Democratic candidate Doug Jones, a former U.S. attorney. “I don’t believe them at all,” Ashley told the AP. “I believe this is Doug Jones, some of his doings, you know. I just don’t believe Roy Moore would do that.” The disbelief stemmed, in part, from Moore’s reputation as a conservative Christian. He was twice removed from his state Supreme Court position, once for disobeying a federal court order to remove a 5,200-pound granite Ten Commandments monument from the lobby of the state judicial building, and later for urging state probate judges to defy the U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized gay marriage. He said more recently that Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., should not be allowed to serve in Congress because he’s a Muslim. Asked about those comments during a Washington visit last week, Moore said only, “I’ll address that later.” The Post reported that Moore, then a 32-year-old district attorney, approached 14-year-old Leigh Corfman in early 1979 outside a courtroom in Etowah County, Alabama. After phone calls and meetings, he drove her to his home some days later and kissed her, the Post quotes Corfman as saying. On a second visit, he took off her shirt and pants and removed his clothes except for his underwear before touching her over her bra and underpants, Corfman told the Post. He also guided her hand to touch him over his underwear, she said. “I wanted it over with — I wanted out,” she told the Post. “Please just get this over with. Whatever this is, just get it over.” Three other women interviewed by the Post said Moore approached them when they were between the ages of 16 and 18 and he was in his early 30s. All four women spoke on the record to the Post. Jones, Moore’s Democratic opponent, released only an eight-word statement from his campaign: “Roy Moore needs to answer these serious charges.” Associated Press writers Alan Fram and Andrew Taylor in Washington, Robert Ray in Heflin, Alabama, and Michael Casey in Manchester, New Hampshire, contributed to this report.

pbs,N/A,Report that Roy Moore had sexual contact with a teen raises questions about his Senate run," The Republican front-runner for a U.S. Senate seat in Alabama is engulfed in a sexual scandal tonight, one month before a special election. The Washington Post reports that Judge Roy Moore had sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl when he was in his early 30s. Three other women say that Moore also approached them when they were teens. Moore is now 70. His campaign called the claims outlandish attacks. But top Republicans took a dim view, including Alabama’s current U.S. senators, Richard Shelby, and Luther Strange, who lost to Moore in a Republican primary this fall. Sen. Luther Strange: They have just come to light, and I have just read about it. And it’s very, very disturbing what I have read about. Sen. Richard Shelby: It’s a devastating, nasty story. If the revelations, if that’s true, then I don’t believe there’d be any place for him in the us Senate. Judy Woodruff: The Senate’s top Republican, Mitch McConnell, also weighed in with a statement saying, simply, “If these allegations are true, he must step aside.” I spoke a short time ago to one of the reporters who broke this story, Beth Reinhard of The Washington Post, as well as to Don Dailey, who covers politics for Alabama Public Television. We began with how the allegations first surfaced. Beth Reinhard: So The Post was in Alabama reporting an unrelated story and heard that Roy Moore had pursued young girls when he was first a prosecutor. And another reporter and I spent weeks in Alabama chasing these leads and reaching out to a lot of people. And when we did reach the women who are quoted in the story today, none of them initially were willing to speak on the record. They were all very reluctant to share their story publicly, and it was only after multiple interviews with them that they decided to come forward. Judy Woodruff: Well, let me ask you first, Beth Reinhard, about the woman who was youngest, I guess, of all of these when this happened. She was 14 years old at a time when Roy Moore was an assistant district attorney. He was in his early 30s. And what does she say happened? Beth Reinhard: So, she was at the courthouse with her mom for a child custody hearing. And Roy came up and introduced himself and offered to watch her while her mother went into the courtroom. He got her phone number. He called her. He picked her up a few days later around the corner from her house, and took her to his house, which is in a woodsy area about 30 minutes away, gave her alcohol, and then, on one occasion, undressed himself, undressed her and touched her over her bra and underwear, and had her touch him. Judy Woodruff: And you report that she told a friend at the time this happened, and then she told her mother years later? Beth Reinhard: She told a couple of friends at the time, and they were — you know, reacted sort of negatively, like, that’s not a good idea. And so she felt ashamed about it, she felt responsible about it. She just sat with it for many years. She is told her mom when she was an adult, and then, even then, thought about coming forward, but didn’t. She had kids that she was worried about, and it just — it really took a lot of time for her to feel comfortable with her decision. Judy Woodruff: And, Beth, just quickly, the other three women alleged what? Beth Reinhard: So, they were a little bit older. They were between the ages of 16 and 18, and they say that Roy asked them out on dates, and two of the three did go out with him. They say he didn’t force himself on them. But, looking back, they realized it was really inappropriate for him, a man in his 30s, to be asking out teenage girls that he met at the mall or in one case at a high school civics class where he was speaking to her class. Judy Woodruff: Don Dailey, what is Roy Moore saying about all of this? Don Dailey: Roy Moore issued a statement today in which he staunchly denied these allegations. He called them the result of fake news and he said they were designed to attack him politically. Roy Moore has been at odds with The Washington Post for a month or so now. He’s been upset about a previous news story concerning his charitable organization, the Foundation for Moral Law, and The Post’s reporting on that. And that on top of these new allegations has led him to believe that this latest piece is a hit piece. But, again, he has staunchly denied these allegations. Judy Woodruff: And, Don, what does Alabama law say about relations, sexual relations with a minor? Don Dailey: We have been checking this afternoon with various officials about what this might mean. A lot of people are still saying that they’re looking into the consequences of these allegations and the statute of limitations, those sorts of things. And another aspect of the law that’s been debated here in Alabama this afternoon is, could Roy Moore’s name possibly be removed from the ballot, if it came that far? And the secretary of state has said this afternoon that state law says it has to be under 76 days from the election before you can remove a name from the ballot. So, the secretary of state here in Alabama said it is too late to remove Roy Moore’s name, should it come to that. Judy Woodruff: Don Dailey, how are others in Alabama reacting to this, and were there any indications of this before this story? Don Dailey: There were not any indications of this. I think a lot of people were caught by surprise here in Alabama. Some of Roy Moore’s defenders have actually raised the contention, why didn’t this come out a long time ago, why is it now just surfacing? Because Roy Moore has been such a public figure here in Alabama for so long. Why is it just coming out now? But a lot of people are surprised. A lot of people are reacting rather guardedly, saying if these allegations prove to be true, that Roy Moore should step down as a candidate. Others are staunchly defending him, especially his base. Roy Moore enjoys a staunch base of supporters here in Alabama, Republicans, conservatives, evangelical Christians who have stood by him through thick and thin through a lot of controversies that he has weathered here in Alabama over the years. Judy Woodruff: Right. Beth Reinhard, is it fair to say The Post is still reporting on this, continuing to report on this? Beth Reinhard: Sure. I mean, we will obviously be keeping an eye on Roy Moore as a candidate through Election Day and beyond that if he’s elected a senator. Judy Woodruff: And, right now, Don Dailey, what are the polls showing, that Roy Moore is ahead, by how much? Don Dailey: The latest polls have him up by double digits, and he has maintained that sort of lead for the last several weeks, since the Republican runoff election here in Alabama. A lot of people are waiting with bated breath now to see what kind of impact these allegations might have on his poll numbers. But, again, his base of support here has been very strong and those who support him most don’t think that it will have a significant impact because they don’t believe the allegations. Judy Woodruff: And, Don, no hint that he’s prepared step down, back off from running, right? Don Dailey: He has made no indication so far that he plans to step down. Judy Woodruff: Don Dailey with Alabama Public Television, Beth Reinhard with The Washington Post, thank you both. Beth Reinhard: Thank you. Don Dailey: Thank you.

pbs,N/A,GOP gears up for intense tax battle as Senate debuts plan," And now to the tax battle, a centerpiece of President Trump’s economic agenda. Republicans pushed ahead today on two fronts. Lisa Desjardins reports. Lisa Desjardins: At the Capitol, a kind of starting bell, or gavel, for one of the largest fiscal and pocketbook fights in modern U.S. history. Rep. Devin Nunes: This is as close to fixing the tax code as we can possibly get. Lisa Desjardins: As the House Ways and Means Committee passed its sweeping tax overhaul. Rep. Kevin Brady: The bill is passed. The committee is adjourned. Lisa Desjardins: And GOP senators released their outline. Man: Today, we get to make a big difference. Lisa Desjardins: That as Democrats decried the GOP plans as rush jobs. Rep. Sander Levin: You are desperate. You have failed to pass anything of substance, anything. Lisa Desjardins: First, in the House, Republicans have made a few changes — restoring a tax credit for adoptions to please social conservatives, and adding a new tax on large piles of foreign profits held by U.S. companies to help the bill’s bottom line. Democrats stressed the bill would still bring red ink. Rep. Mike Thompson: We know that if this were to become law, our national debt would grow by $2.3 trillion. We know that homeowners in many states across this great nation would lose. Lisa Desjardins: But House Speaker Paul Ryan pushed the GOP mantra, that borrowing for tax cuts is worth it to try to grow the economy. Rep. Paul Ryan: We’re actually letting people keep more of their own money. We’re cleaning up the loopholes in the tax code and having fairer tax system, so we’re going to have faster economic growth, bigger paychecks, fairer taxes. Lisa Desjardins: As the House bill moves forward, though, it faces its next challenge from Republicans in the Senate. Late today, they unveiled their own plan, with some key differences from the House version. For individuals, senators would have seven tax brackets, compared with four in the House bill. And senators wouldn’t fully repeal the estate tax. Instead, they would double the amounts that would be exempt to more than $10 million per individual. Another big one, affecting high-cost states like New York or California. The Senate plan would totally repeal all deductions on state and local taxes. The House would allow a $10,000 property tax break. But the Senate would keep the home mortgage deduction as it is now, helping some new homeowners in those states. Sen. Tim Scott: This is truly a good day. Lisa Desjardins: Most Senate Republicans came out embracing the plan. Sen. Tim Scott: Tax reform is not about numbers. Tax reform is about everyday Americans be able to keep more of their hard-earned money. Lisa Desjardins: But there is some doubt, especially about that red ink. Arizona’s Jeff Flake was asked if the plan helps the middle class. Sen. Jeff Flake: I think it helps. I do. But nobody’s going to be helped if we just balloon the deficit. Lisa Desjardins: And the Senate is going to be the big battle. You know the Senate can only lose two Republican votes, Republicans can, and get this plan passed. But Senator Flake isn’t the only one who raised questions. Today, Senator Ron Johnson told “NewsHour” that his problems with some of the business provisions have still not been revolved. And, in addition, Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski said she’s still looking at the bill. She’s not a yes yet. But, Judy, one thing we know Murkowski probably likes, an addition to the Senate bill, they will include a provision allowing drilling in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge, something Murkowski has wanted, but is highly debated. Judy Woodruff: So, Lisa, given all that, what does it look like? Where does this go from here? Lisa Desjardins: All right, this is a time to really pay attention, because next week we expect the House to take its final vote or its vote on its plan. And then the week after Thanksgiving, the end of November, the Senate is expected to vote. That’s what John Cornyn told me and a few other reporters. So, then those two versions will come together in December in a very intense couple of weeks at the beginning of that month, Judy. Judy Woodruff: So a very fast timetable. Lisa Desjardins: Very fast, that’s right. Judy Woodruff: Lisa Desjardins, reporting from the Capitol, thanks. Watch the Full Episode Nov 09 By PBS NewsHour Nov 09 By PBS NewsHour Support Provided By:

pbs,N/A,Outgoing IRS chief ‘deeply concerned’ about cuts to already strained agency," As Republicans try to pass a tax overhaul, the IRS is once again expected to be in the spotlight. For years, Commissioner John Koskinen has been a lightning rod for Republican lawmakers, who have called for his impeachment and criticized the agency he’s been running since 2013. As one of the last Obama administration holdovers, he will complete his term as the IRS commissioner this Sunday. I sat down with him yesterday, and we talked about the strains on the IRS, his thoughts about the agency, and President Trump’s controversial tax returns. John Koskinen, thank you very much for talking with us. John Koskinen: I’m delighted to be here. Judy Woodruff: So, how do you feel about leaving this job? John Koskinen: It’s a poignant time. I have had, actually, surprisingly enough, a wonderful time at the IRS. It’s a great group of people to work with, and I’m going to miss them. Judy Woodruff: Well, as you know, there are some Republicans in the Congress who have been calling for your head practically since the day you arrived. You came in the midst of this dispute over whether the IRS had been unfairly scrutinizing applications for non — for tax-exempt status on the part of Tea Party groups, and there was a lot of discussion around that. Did you feel you came in almost at a time of being under siege? John Koskinen: It was pretty close to that. In my history as such, I usually get called in when agencies are under great stress, and so this certainly met that criteria. Judy Woodruff: Did you ever feel your job was in jeopardy from this criticism? John Koskinen: Again, I thought there were a lot of very thoughtful, responsible congressmen in both parties who understood that I had not personally created this problem and that I was doing the best anybody could expect getting through it. So, the move to impeach me, I thought, was probably not going to succeed. Judy Woodruff: You had been in several years when President Trump was elected. He came into office. I think some people thought, initially, well, he’s going to make a change at the IRS, but, lo and behold, he didn’t. And it turns out the two of you have known each other a long time. You go back, what, four decades. You knew each other in business. John Koskinen: Correct. I negotiated with him the first transaction he ever did as an individual outside of Brooklyn. Judy Woodruff: What was it like to deal with him? John Koskinen: He was young. He was 29 at the time. I wasn’t much older. We spent several months negotiating the sale of the Penn Central’s Commodore Hotel to him, which is he turned into the Grand Hyatt, which sits on top of Grand Central. And, as I have said, he was energetic, irrepressible. He was a pleasure to deal with. We actually negotiated hard for a long time, but we enjoyed it. Judy Woodruff: Did you stay in touch with him over the years? John Koskinen: I have talked to him, I have seen very occasionally over the time. He’s been kind a couple of times along the way to make positive comments about me, but we haven’t seen each other regularly. Judy Woodruff: This is a president who has not made public his own tax returns. We know or we have read, because you have said so, that they are kept in a certain place inside the IRS facility. Do you know where they are? John Koskinen: I know generally where they are. I haven’t seen — they’re in a locked room in a locked cabinet near my office, but I have actually not seen either the room or the Cabinet. Judy Woodruff: So you haven’t seen the returns? John Koskinen: No, I actually have no authority to see anybody’s returns. We are very careful in the IRS. No one can look at anyone’s return unless they have a specific need to know as part of an audit. Judy Woodruff: Is it normal for a president’s taxes to be kept in a special place? I mean, what — how did they happen to be where they are? John Koskinen: Actually, all the president’s returns are kept in that famous locked cabinet in the locked office. They are separated out, because we feel very strongly they need to be handled separately. They need to be protected. Judy Woodruff: So, as soon as they are elected, this happens automatically? Is that what you’re saying? John Koskinen: Yes. And so, even in this case, a year-and-a-half ago, in the summer of 2016, I asked our people to make sure that, for all the candidates, once the nominees were known, that we protected their existing tax returns, as well as being prepared for the filing of their next tax returns. Judy Woodruff: Do you have an opinion, John Koskinen, about whether President Trump should have made his tax returns public? John Koskinen: I don’t think that’s a position the IRS commissioner should take. I think that’s a decision the president makes on his own. We respect that decision. Our goal is to, in fact, ensure the privacy of everyone’s tax returns and tax information. Judy Woodruff: As you leave — and we have talked to you about this when I have interviewed you in the past — you have expressed concern over the years about how much strain has been placed on the IRS. You have been concerned about budget cuts, about losing employees. How stretched is the Internal Revenue Service right now? John Koskinen: Well, my farewell tour of the Hill over the last four to six weeks has been to advise them or warn them that I am deeply concerned that we have cut the agency far more than it can and should be cut if it is going to continue to function effectively. It’s either its I.T. system is going to fail. And it’s running an antiquated system, out of date in many ways. And we won’t be able to do the processing of filing season. Or, as we continue to do fewer audits, the compliance system will erode, and that will cost the government billions of dollars. Judy Woodruff: Of course, you’re leaving just as the Congress is discussing the president, the Republicans’ proposal to reform the tax code. Again, major — they’re calling for a major overhaul. How do you look on that? John Koskinen: Well, I think and I have always thought that the tax code is far too complicated and far too difficult for taxpayers to navigate their way through. So, we have been clear from the start that, while we don’t have, again, an interest in any of the policy decisions, anything that can be done to simplify the code for taxpayers, we would strongly support. So, in this case, you can’t do significant tax reform without providing the agency the financial resources it needs to actually implement it. But there is no doubt it would be and will be the highest priority of the all of the employees. Judy Woodruff: So, finally, to all those Americans who curse the IRS on April the 15th or at other times of the year, what do you say to them? John Koskinen: Well, first, they have to remember the taxes they pay fund the operations of the government. And the IRS, notwithstanding the views a lot of people have, spends a significant amount of its time trying to help taxpayers figure out how much they owe and how to pay it. I have often said, if you’re having difficulty with your taxes, you don’t have to hire somebody off late-night TV to help you. We’re anxious to help those who want to become compliant. Judy Woodruff: John Koskinen, stepping down as commissioner of the IRS, thank you very much. John Koskinen: Thank you, Judy.

pbs,"Nov 9, 2017 5:58 PM EST",Dawn Adams is first open lesbian in Virginia House," The Associated Press on Thursday declared Democratic candidate Dawn Adams as the winner of a seat representing the Richmond area. She defeated Republican incumbent G.M. “Manoli” Loupassi, who has represented the district for the past 10 years. Adams won by less than 1 percentage point, with a margin of about 325 votes out of nearly 40,000 ballots cast. She claimed victory Wednesday night. Loupassi actually conceded the race on election night Tuesday, but the AP at that point said the race was too close to call. Adams’ victory gives Democrats 49 seats out of 100 in the House of Delegates. READ MORE: Are this week’s Democratic wins the start of an anti-Trump surge? Left:

pbs,"Nov 9, 2017 5:35 PM EST",Are this week’s Democratic wins the start of an anti-Trump surge?," Not so fast, Republicans said Wednesday. But they acknowledged that setbacks in Virginia, New Jersey and elsewhere on Tuesday created new urgency for the GOP to fulfill its list of campaign promises before voters head back to the polls next year. They, along with President Donald Trump, have failed to demolish “Obamacare” and now are straining to approve a far-reaching tax overhaul despite controlling the White House and both houses of Congress. “If anything, this just puts more pressure on making sure we follow through,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said at an event hosted by the Washington Examiner. He added, “I think it simply means we’ve got to deliver.” Whether the president’s party delivers or not, there is clear cause for concern for a Republican Party that would lose its House majority if Democrats gained 24 seats next fall. Tuesday’s results left little doubt that Trump’s dismal approval ratings can drag down Republican allies, particularly those serving in states he lost last November. And even if his ratings show signs of improvement, history suggests that the first midterm elections for any new president often lead to major gains for the opposing party. An early string of Republican retirement announcements in competitive districts across Florida, New Jersey and Arizona adds to the GOP’s challenge. “We’re taking our country back from Donald Trump one election at a time,” Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez said in a Wednesday conference call. “This is not just one night. It is a trend.” Added Schumer, the New York Democrat: “Our Republican friends better look out.” Trump declared that the blame for Tuesday’s losses was not his. “Ed Gillespie worked hard but did not embrace me or what I stand for,” the president tweeted as he toured Asia. Actually, Gillespie, a mainstream Republican who lost the Virginia governor’s race, had taken up Trump-like positions on such issues as Confederate monuments, NFL players’ national anthem demonstrations and the dangers of Hispanic gangs. Trump endorsed him but was not invited to campaign in the state in recent weeks. Republican National Committee Chair Ronna Romney McDaniel had a different view from Trump’s. “I absolutely think any candidate should be embracing the president,” she said, “and I think Ed did.” As for Tuesday’s longer-term significance for the Democrats, both parties’ leaders know that much can change in the year before voters decide the 2018 midterm elections. And Republicans enjoy a redistricting advantage that limits the number of truly competitive House races, thanks in large part to GOP routs during Barack Obama’s eight years in office. Also, Democrats wrestle with their own party strife, pitting the Bernie Sanders’ wing against the more mainstream. The liberal group Democracy for America had abandoned Virginia’s gubernatorial candidate, Ralph Northam, over immigration policy, then celebrated his win days later. “The plus of a tidal wave like this is it washes away the stains of all the campaigns,” Charles Chamberlain, DFA’s executive director, said in an interview. Republican Party leaders also expect their political outlook to improve dramatically once the GOP-led Congress takes action on taxes or health care. Based on Tuesday’s results, they need to act quickly. Governors’ races in Virginia and New Jersey — where Phil Murphy will replace Republican Chris Christie — were perhaps the most consequential, but Democrats also celebrated victories in Maine, where voters slapped the state’s Republican governor, a Trump ally, by backing a measure to expand Medicaid coverage under Obama’s health care law. Manchester, New Hampshire, elected its first Democratic mayor in more than a decade. And Virginia voters sent a large and diverse group of new Democrats to the statehouse, including a transgender heavy metal singer, a member of Democratic Socialists of America and a former news anchor whose journalist girlfriend was fatally shot while on-air in 2015. The results were particularly troubling for Republicans serving in suburban districts in states Trump lost last fall. Schumer singled out by name one of the most vulnerable House Republicans in the nation: Rep. Barbara Comstock, whose northern Virginia district lies just west of Washington. Roughly two of three voters in the counties that primarily make up Comstock’s district backed the Democrat in this week’s governor’s race. Sensing opportunity, more than a half dozen Democrats have already lined up to challenge her. A spokesman for Comstock said Democrats have regularly underestimated the two-term congresswoman. “Barbara has always over-performed and that won’t change in 2018,” said political director Ken Nunnenkamp. Trump’s team concedes the Republican Party’s suburban challenges but predicts voters will bounce back once Congress begins to enact his agenda. Embedded in that diagnosis, however, is a warning for Republican lawmakers that continued inaction could be disastrous. Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina acknowledged the urgency for his party to produce results. “We’ve got to be RINOs,” he said, “Republicans in Need of Outcomes.” AP writers Zeke Miller, Erica Werner and Juliet Linderman in Washington and Nicholas Riccardi in Denver contributed to this report.

pbs,"Nov 9, 2017 11:11 AM EST",Trump’s voter fraud commission is now facing a lawsuit from one of its members," The lawsuit, filed by Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., claims violations of the Federal Advisory Committee Act and seeks to compel the commission to hand over all documents Dunlap has requested along with all future documents prepared for or by the commission. In addition, Dunlap is asking the court to compel the commission to include him in all communications among commissioners and staff and prevent the commission from releasing any final report until he has had a chance to review it. “My goal in filing this lawsuit is to bring the commission into full compliance with FACA, which would allow me and all of my fellow commissioners to fulfill our roles as full, participating members and provide a meaningful report to the President upon concluding our work,” Dunlap said in a statement. Emails seeking comment from the office of Vice President Mike Pence, who chairs the commission; Andrew Kossack, the commission’s executive director; and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who serves as vice chair, were not immediately returned. All three are named defendants, along with the Executive Office of the President, which is staffing the commission and maintaining its records. The lawsuit was filed on Dunlap’s behalf by American Oversight, a watchdog group. The commission has spurred controversy from the moment it was established in May. Its first significant action was to request a wide range of information about all registered voters in every state, including partial Social Security numbers, dates of birth, addresses and voting history. Critics say Trump is using the commission to find support for his unsubstantiated claims of widespread voter fraud that cost him the popular vote during the 2016 election. Democrat Hillary Clinton received 2.8 million more votes nationwide than Trump. After facing strong criticism from both Republican and Democratic state officials, the commission scaled back the request but questions remain over how useful the information will be since 15 states have refused to participate, according to a survey by the Associated Press. Dunlap’s lawsuit said Trump, Pence and Kobach included the four Democrats serving on the 11-member panel “to provide a veneer of legitimacy by making the commission’s membership bipartisan.” Instead, the lawsuit said, “the Commission and its staff have compromised the legitimacy of any findings that may emerge from this process.” While there have been isolated cases of voter fraud in the U.S., there is no evidence of it being a widespread problem. Critics have said the commission is stacked with people who favor voting restrictions, rather than expanding access, and that the commission has a predetermined agenda that will result in recommendations making it more difficult for people to register to vote, remain registered and cast ballots. Last month, the Government Accountability Office accepted a request by a group of U.S. senators to investigate their concerns of a lack of transparency. Democratic senators have filed at least five separate requests for information with the commission since June, and a Sept. 12 follow-up letter noted that none had received a response. The Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law also is suing, alleges the commission is violating federal open meetings and disclosure laws.

Watch the ceremony in the player above. The officers to receive the department’s highest honor are David Bailey and Crystal Griner of the Capitol Police, and Alexandria police officers Nicole Battaglia, Alexander Jensen and Kevin Jobe. A gunman, who later was revealed to have grievances with the GOP, opened fire at the Republican baseball practice in Alexandria, Virginia, in June. Five people, including Scalise, were injured in the attack. The Louisiana congressman returned to Congress in September after months in recovery after bullets struck him in the hip, hitting blood vessels and organs that would require multiple surgeries.

pbs,"Nov 9, 2017 9:11 AM EST","Underwood, Paisley poke fun at politics, President Trump at CMA Awards"," Underwood said producers required this year’s show to be a “politics-free zone.” “Clearly we can’t say or play anything,” she said. Paisley, strapped with his guitar, playfully asked if that meant he’d be barred from performing such songs as “Hold Me Closer, Bernie Sanders” and “Stand By Your Manafort.” He suggested other titles that incorporated the names of Anthony Scaramucci and Hillary Clinton. Underwood and Paisley then proceeded with a parody of her 2005 hit “Before He Cheats,” reconfigured to address the commander in chief. They sang about a gold-plated White House toilet seat, leading into a chorus of “Maybe next time he’ll think before he tweets.” Paisley continued the gag later in the show, mentioning a song called “I’m So Indicted” and a medley of tunes by “Huey Lewis and the Fake News.” ""Maybe next time he'll think before he tweets."" Carrie Underwood and Brad Paisley take aim at Trump at the Country Music Awards. pic.twitter.com/OtLoX5nR6c — NBC News (@NBCNews) November 9, 2017  The Country Music Association initially asked reporters covering the show to refrain from asking musicians about politics or recent shootings. Artists and journalists balked and the restrictions were lifted. Presenters and winners also used their time onstage to talk about unity, if not politics. Presenter Tyler Perry received a standing ovation when he said, “It has never been more important that we all right now come together and find some common ground.” Karen Fairchild of Little Big Town, which was named vocal group of the year, said the CMA Awards should be about harmony. “It should be about what we can do together to change things,” she said. “Kindness is an attractive quality. We actually could change the way things are going, we just have to step out and be together.” READ MORE: Democrats dissect election results and find big dose of good news Left:

pbs,"Nov 9, 2017 9:00 AM EST","After rough election night, top Trump backers differ on path forward"," Appearing in key states Trump carried a year ago, former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer and Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel called on Republicans to come together, while former White House strategist Steve Bannon maintained an aggressive tone toward any in the GOP who would stand in the president’s way. Their remarks in Iowa and Michigan underscored the tension bubbling over in Washington. “Let me tell you, there is a stark difference between the worst Republican and the best Democrat,” Spicer said during the Republican Party of Iowa’s annual Reagan Dinner in Des Moines. Spicer lamented Republicans in Virginia who decided not to vote Tuesday for GOP gubernatorial candidate Ed Gillespie because he didn’t pass their “litmus tests.” Bannon, meanwhile, took aim at veteran Republican lawmakers and entrenched party insiders, whom he has pledged to root out of the Senate next year. He grouped Gillespie — a lobbyist, former RNC chairman and adviser to former President George W. Bush — with the GOP forces of old. Trump needs more outsiders at his side, Bannon said. “He’s had some victories. He’s had some defeats,” Bannon said of Trump. “Most of the defeats are because the Republican establishment cannot execute on the plan.” Judy Woodruff sits down with Amy Walter of the Cook Political Report and Stu Rothenberg of Inside Elections to get a close-up look at Tuesday’s off-year election results and how the “Trump effect” is motivating Democrats. Bannon spoke at a Republican dinner in Macomb County, Michigan, a working-class Detroit suburb which former President Barack Obama carried twice but where Trump handily beat Democrat Hillary Clinton last year. Despite Trump’s low approval ratings — 33 percent in a Gallup poll this week, the lowest of his presidency — McDaniel, who also spoke at the Iowa banquet, painted an optimistic picture of the economy, touted record party fundraising and said, “I feel very confident in the candidates I see running across the country.” “I hope we expand our majority in the Senate so we can get more things done,” she said. However, Bannon has pledged to find primary opponents for virtually every Republican senator standing for re-election next year, arguing they have not adequately defended Trump against attacks from within his own party, chiefly by Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker and Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake. With Corker and Flake having announced plans to not seek re-election, Bannon is gunning for GOP Sen. Dean Heller in Nevada and has even mentioned challenging reliable conservatives such as John Barrasso of Wyoming and Deb Fischer of Nebraska. One of Bannon’s chief goals is ousting Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, whom he blames for not following through on long-promised legislation to undo Obama’s 2010 health care law. “They only understand one thing. You cannot be nice to these guys,” Bannon said, referring to McConnell. “You have to drop the hammer. That’s what he understands.” Eggert reported from Warren, Michigan. Left:

His victory wasn’t announced until Wednesday afternoon, due to the instant-runoff voting system Minneapolis uses. Cunningham is a 29-year-old transgender man. His victory follows one by Andrea Jenkins, a transgender woman who easily won a seat on the City Council Tuesday night. It adds to a banner night for transgender people in public office. Danica Roem became the nation’s first openly transgender state lawmaker by winning a Virginia Statehouse seat. Victory Fund, a group that advocated for LGBT candidates, said Jenkins was the nation’s first openly transgender woman elected to a major city’s governing board. Left:

pbs,N/A,Virginia race set the tone for tide of Democratic victories," Democrats are walking a little taller after Election Day delivered a number of wins -- a far cry from the bitter defeats of 2016. Ralph Northam won a promotion to governor in the state of Virginia, setting the tone for other statewide races carried by Democrats in the Trump era. Judy Woodruff reports. Judy Woodruff: From the White House on down, they are still digesting Tuesday’s election results and analyzing the possible Trump effect. But two things are already clear: Democrats are walking a little taller, and Republicans are licking their wounds. Tom Perez: The Democratic Party is back, my friends! (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) Judy Woodruff: For Democrats, the election night celebrations were a far cry from the bitter defeats one year ago. Virginia set the tone: Lieutenant Governor Ralph Northam won a promotion with his party’s first major victory in the Trump era. The governor-elect and pediatrician said the Old Dominion answered the call. Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam: Virginia has told us to end the divisiveness, that we will not condone hatred and bigotry, and to end the politics that have torn this country apart. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) Judy Woodruff: Northam easily defeated Republican Ed Gillespie, 54 percent to 45 percent, to keep the governor’s mansion Democratic. Gillespie had kept President Trump at arm’s length, but shared his positions, highlighting immigrant crime and defending Confederate monuments. The president did tweet several times in favor of Gillespie, and recorded a late robo-call of support. But from South Korea today, Mr. Trump dished criticism, tweeting that “Gillespie worked hard, but didn’t embrace me or what I stand for.” The Democratic tide in Virginia also carried other statewide races and added 14 seats in the House of Delegates. Democrats need just three more seats with a handful of races yet to be called to retake the chamber for the first time in two decades. One of the winners was Danica Roem, the first openly transgender candidate to win a seat in any state legislature. Danica Roem: We won because I am a transgender woman, because I am a reporter, because I am lifelong resident of Manassas, because of my inherent identifiers, not despite them. I never ran away from them. I championed them. Judy Woodruff: Roem ousted Republican Bob Marshall, one of the state’s most conservative legislators. He had sponsored a bill that would limit the bathrooms used by transgender people. Meanwhile, in New Jersey, Democrat Philip Murphy won the governor’s race, in a pickup for the party. The former Goldman Sachs executive capitalized on deep discontent with Republican Governor Chris Christie, who was term-limited. Philip Murphy: Tonight, we declare the days of division are over. We will move forward together. This is exactly who we are, New Jersey. We have each other’s backs. Judy Woodruff: Across the country, in Washington state, Democrats retook the state Senate. That move solidified the blue wall of Democratic legislative majorities up and down the West Coast. Big city Democratic mayors also won reelection, in New York, Boston and Detroit. All are critics of President Trump. And in another slap at the president’s policies, Maine voted to expand Medicaid under Obamacare. Here in Washington today, Republican senators from West Virginia’s Shelley Moore Capito to Colorado’s Cory Gardner offered differing explanations for the defeat. Sen. Cory Gardner: I think what this shows is that we have to make sure we provide results for the American people. Rep. Shelley Moore Capito: We need to tighten up our message. We really need to come through with what we said we’re going to do. Judy Woodruff: Others in the GOP blamed the losses on candidates not fully backing the president. And we will hear from the head of the Democratic Party, and a top Trump White House official, right after the news summary.

pbs,N/A,News Wrap: GOP tax bill runs into roadblocks over deficit estimate," In the day’s other news: The Republican tax reform bill that emerged from the U.S. House of Representatives ran into new obstacles. The Congressional Budget Office reported that it would add at least $1.7 trillion to deficits over 10 years. That may be more than allowed under budgetary rules. The CBO also said that repealing Obamacare’s mandate that individuals buy health care insurance would save $338 billion over a decade to help finance tax cuts. But that is less than first estimated. Vice President Pence traveled today to the Texas town where a gunman killed more than two dozen people. He was greeted by Governor Greg Abbott in San Antonio, and later met with first-responders and victims’ families in Sutherland Springs. Meanwhile, U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis ordered a review of the Air Force’s failure to enter the gunman’s criminal history into an FBI database. The Trump administration has reinstated restrictions on Americans visiting Cuba, under a new policy announced in June. Individual travel is largely eliminated in favor of organized tour groups run by U.S. companies. And dozens of hotels and other businesses are blacklisted over their links to Cuba’s military, intelligence and security services. President Trump’s nominee for secretary of homeland security, Kirstjen Nielsen, had her confirmation hearing today. She was picked after her boss, Secretary John Kelly, became White House chief of staff. Today, Nielsen echoed Kelly’s position on the president’s call for a wall along the Mexican border. Kirstjen Nielsen: There is no need for a wall from sea to shining sea. What we need to do is work with the operators. Should I be confirmed, I would look forward to speaking with state and local officials, those on the ground, both law enforcement and federal law enforcement, to understand where we need some sort of physical barrier. Judy Woodruff: Nielsen drew heat from Democratic senators when she said it is not clear if humans are the primary cause of climate change. The nominee to be the president’s top environmental adviser faced similar questions at a separate hearing. Kathleen Hartnett White said that she is not persuaded by a new federal finding that manmade carbon emissions are the main cause of global warming. Instead, she repeated her view that carbon dioxide is — quote — “a plant nutrient,” and not a pollutant. The U.S. Air Force Academy now says that an apparent racial incident was a hoax. It turns out that it was a black student who, in September, wrote the racial slurs outside dorm rooms at the academy’s prep school. The initial incident prompted Lieutenant Jay Silveria, the academy’s superintendent, to give a stern speech to cadets condemning racism. Former President Obama will not be serving on a Chicago jury after all. He reported for duty today, only to be dismissed. His appearance caused a stir at Cook County court offices. He went through the standard procedure for prospective jurors, including watching a 20-minute informational video. And on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average gained six points to close at 23563. The Nasdaq rose 21, and the S&amp;P 500 added three. And Pope Francis is urging the faithful, including clergy, to put down their cell phones during public masses at the Vatican and pray instead. The pontiff told the crowd in St. Peter’s Square today that taking pictures during the service is — quote — “an ugly thing.” And he said the mass is not a show. So, remember, no cell phones.

pbs,N/A,"Tom Perez: 2017 wins are a start, but every ZIP code counts"," What led to Democrats’ election success on Tuesday? Democratic National Committee chair Tom Perez joins Judy Woodruff to take stock of the energy coming out of the 2017 victories. Judy Woodruff: We return now to our top story: the Democratic Party’s big victories last night and the message voters sent to Washington. I spoke with Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, about this earlier today and what led to the party’s success. Tom Perez: I think we’re making real progress, Judy. We had a very good night last night. We put our game plan into action. Our game plan is organizing, organizing, organizing, make sure we come together with our unity. We saw that in Virginia, where you had a spirited Democratic primary, where everyone took the high road. We had great turnout in the primary. And that was a bellwether of a general election with record turnout. And the same thing in New Jersey, Phil Murphy. And when we lead with our values and we put those values into action, whether it’s health care for all — that was a big issue in Virginia and New Jersey — talking about education reform. That was another big issue in those areas. When we’re leading with our values and when we’re out there talking to everyone, and when we’re running people up and down the ballot. That was critically important. In Virginia, they — Democrats have not won as many seats as they won last night, the last time that happened was in the 19th century. That’s a real bellwether of the wave that occurred last night in Virginia. Judy Woodruff: That’s true, all true, but you still have Republicans in the majority of governor seats, control of the House, the Senate and the White House. Democrats still have a big hill to climb. Tom Perez: Oh, I couldn’t agree more. Last night was a really remarkable start, but it’s a start. We’re no where near the summit of the mountain. But what we know is what works. We had to get back to basics, organizing, organizing everywhere, recruiting good candidates up and down the ticket. The new mission of the DNC is to help elect Democrats up and down the tickets, from the school board to the Oval Office. We were too focused on simply electing a new president every four years. We have changed that mission, and we’re making sure we are invested everywhere. Judy Woodruff: Let me ask about your message, because some are saying still the Democratic message is too much anti-Donald Trump and not enough something positive. Tom Perez: Well, I will tell you, the candidates that were running yesterday were talking about the issues that people cared about the most. Ralph Northam is a healer, the governor-elect in Virginia. He was talking about health care as a right for all and not a privilege for a few. And, as it turned out, the number one issue for voters in Virginia was health care. They understand that Ralph Northam is going to help them expand Medicaid and not take away their access to health care. Same thing in New Jersey, real concerns on that area. Judy Woodruff: What is your advice, Tom Perez, though, for Democrats running next year? because we know right now, for example, you have got Democrats in the Senate who are talking to President Trump — there was a meeting just yesterday — and his people about tax reform. Should Democrats, especially Democrats in red states, states that Donald Trump won, should they try to work with this president to get things done, or should they oppose him at every step? Tom Perez: Well, listen, if we can work in a bipartisan fashion, we have always been for that. The Affordable Care Act is a great example. Patty Murray and Lamar Alexander right now are working on a bipartisan bill to stabilize the markets. What the Republicans have been trying to do is just repeal with nothing else. We need to amend Obamacare, not end it. And the voters in Virginia especially sent a very clear message to the Republicans that, when you try to take away our health care, we’re going to vote against you. And so, when we can find common ground, we try. But the current tax bill that has been put forth is not reform. It’s a massive giveaway to very, very wealthy people and corporations, at the expense of middle-class families and working people. And it’s not a good bill. Judy Woodruff: So, are you saying Democrats shouldn’t work with the administration to try to shape that at all, or what? Tom Perez: Well, we have a — no, Judy, I’m saying quite the contrary. We have a vision for helping to bring about tax fairness. This is not tax reform, though. The challenge that we have, Judy, is the Republicans don’t want to work with us. This bill is a disaster for so many millions of Americans. Judy Woodruff: Let me… Tom Perez: And they’re just trying to ram it through before people can actually see the fine print. Judy Woodruff: Let me finally ask you, what is the Democratic Party’s message to voters in red states, voters who voted for Donald Trump? Are you — I assume you’re going to say you’re not writing them off. What is your message to them to get them… Tom Perez: Judy, our motto of the new DNC is every zip code counts. We can win everywhere. We won three special elections in Oklahoma earlier this year in the state legislature. And how did we do that? We had great candidates. We delivered a clear message. In Oklahoma, the message was education. Education is the equalizer. And in Oklahoma, they’re engaged in radical right-wing engineering to make public education a shell of what it needs to be. And then boots on the ground. We’re competing everywhere, because I believe that the message of health care as a right for all, and not a privilege for a few, it resonates in rural America, it resonates in urban America, it resonates in Kentucky, it resonates in New York City. And when we lead with those values, we’re fighting for economic opportunity for everyone. We believe in shared prosperity for everyone, not simply prosperity for a few at the top. And we believe in the bold possibilities of this nation. And we want to make sure everybody has the tools to realize their highest and best dreams. We want an America that people can be proud of. Right now, people aren’t proud of what they see this president do day in and day out. He’s a divider. He’s not a uniter. And I think the voters spoke very loudly and clearly about that yesterday. We want uniters. Judy Woodruff: Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic Party, thank you very much. Tom Perez: Pleasure to be with you, Judy.

pbs,N/A,"Republican voter excitement depressed after Obamacare repeal failure, says White House official"," What do Tuesday’s election results favoring Democrats mean for President Trump’s agenda? Marc Short, the White House Director of Legislative Affairs, joins Judy Woodruff to look ahead. Judy Woodruff: And now for the Trump administration’s perspective on last night’s results, and what they may mean for the president’s agenda. With me now, the White House director of legislative affairs, Marc Short. Thank you very much for being with us. So, you just heard, Marc Short, what Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic Party, had to say, that Democrats are recruiting strong candidates everywhere, and this was a strong beginning for them. How do you see it, yesterday’s results? Marc Short: Well, Judy, thanks for having me on first. I think that, as we look over the last year, there’s no doubt the Democrats secured two victories last night in Democrat states, and yet Republicans have won five congressional seats in seats that were open seats. And so, on the federal level, we have continued to add. We have 240 House Republicans now hoping to advance our agenda. And so I think that people can read a lot into each of their things that they want. And the reality is, Virginia continues to shift to the left. Virginia has continued to become a more and more Democrat state. And I don’t think it’s a surprise that they won last night. I think Ed’s a very talented and smart political adviser, but I don’t think we were that surprised by the results. Judy Woodruff: Ed Gillespie. Marc Short: Yes. Judy Woodruff: You’re not surprised. And we noticed, of course, the president — as soon as the results were called in Virginia, the president was pretty critical of Ed Gillespie. He said – He didn’t embrace me enough. What more should Ed Gillespie have done? Marc Short: Well, I think that we were disappointed in Ed’s defeat, for sure, but I think the president is making the point that the president wasn’t invited to come into the state and campaign with Ed. And he feels like certainly the left was animated and rallied. And, unfortunately, I don’t think we activated our base in the same way on the Republican side. And I think that that’s simply the point the president’s making. But, again, we take comfort in the Republican seats we have continued to hold on to. In many cases, special elections in Georgia, people were predicting Democrats were going to take that seat from us, and they didn’t. We have won seats in Kansas and Montana and last night in Utah. Judy Woodruff: I noticed today that the chair of the Republican Party, Ronna McDaniel, said that she thought Ed Gillespie did sufficiently embrace the president in the campaign. Marc Short: I think that — again, I believe that Ed is one of the smartest political people I know. I think he’s won a lot of races for other people. I think, unfortunately, this is a difficult year for him to run. And I think it’s a state that’s become more and more Democrat over the years. Judy Woodruff: What we are seeing, Marc Short, though, in Virginia and other places, where there were races yesterday, is energy on the part of Democrats. Marc Short: Sure. Judy Woodruff: Many of them do seem to be motivated to defeat Republicans, to defeat the president. Marc Short: Yes. Judy Woodruff: How worried are you and others in the White House about that next year in the midterm? Marc Short: I think that next year’s a long way off, Judy. I think the way that we can make sure that our base animated is to ensure that we deliver on the promises we made. I think you look back to when the president was elected, there are several things he campaigned on. He campaigned on the Supreme Court, which he delivered on with Judge Gorsuch. He campaigned on regulatory relief, which he’s delivered on. He campaigned on tax relief, which we’re about to deliver on. I think one of our challenges right now, though, is, one of his other promises was repealing Obamacare. And I think, after six years of campaign promises that Republicans would do that, when given the chance, they didn’t. And I think you saw a lot of depressed excitement among Republicans after the summer, when that effort failed. So, we need to get back to delivering on what we promised we would do. Judy Woodruff: Well, speaking of that, let’s talk about one of the things you’re trying to deliver on. And that is tax reform. Its originated — the plan, proposal has originated in the House, but it’s already running into some headwinds. And then, just today, you have the boy partisan joint committee — congressional Committee on Taxation saying that there’s a problem here, that after a certain number of years — yes, it starts out helping the middle class, but after the year 2027, the percentage of people in the middle class being helped will start to go down. That gets at the very fundamental argument for this, doesn’t it? Marc Short: Let’s keep in mind three things the president said he wanted in tax relief. First is middle-income relief. Second is to provide corporate relief, because, frankly, what’s happened is, our jobs have left America because our corporate tax system is outdated. We need to bring those jobs back and give corporations less reasons to avert. And third is to simplify the tax code and get rid of so much special treatment that is there and special deductions. Go back to your first point on what the Joint Taxation — Joint Committee on Taxation said. They also said it’s a net tax decrease for every income level over the 10 years. Now, what you point out is, individually, in a particular year, the way that some of those specific credits roll out, there could be a bump in a particular year. But you look over the 10 years, and it’s a tax decrease for those families. It’s what we promised and what we’re going to deliver on. Judy Woodruff: But you still have, as I know you know very well, folks out there who have looked on the effect on corporations who are saying, this is a boon to many corporations that already get so many tax breaks. And you have got the Senate, Republicans in the Senate looking at it and saying, wait a minute, we want to delay the corporate tax cuts. How do you and the White House look at that? Marc Short: Well, let’s keep in mind that the relief we’re providing the tax rates is because the international average for developed countries is now 21 percent. In America, it’s 35 percent. It’s the reason that so many companies have left our shores and gone overseas. In fact, it’s one of the reasons we think that Trump won many of the Industrial Midwest states, because that’s where they have been hit the most. What we’re doing, though, is eliminating many of those deductions, Judy, that you mentioned. That is the tradeoff. We think that this tax code shouldn’t be for those who are the wealthiest, who are able to hire lobbyists and protect their special interests. So, we’re cleaning out the tax code and, in exchange, lowering the rates. That’s the objective. Judy Woodruff: What about, though, Marc Short, this notion that the House of Representatives come up with one proposal? It’s pretty clear the Senate Republicans are coming up with a fairly different proposal. Where is the White House going to come down on this? Marc Short: Well, Judy, we have worked for many months together. We had meetings with the speaker and with the leader and with the chairman of Ways and Means, Kevin Brady, as well as with Chairman Hatch, to make sure that we were on the same page. Ultimately, there was a few thing that we couldn’t agree on, but I think that, as you see these two plans roll out, 90 percent will be aligned, and so the process will work. The House will get their bill done. We think they are on schedule tomorrow to get it out of committee and to get it completed in the House before Thanksgiving. The Senate will then have their turn. And the legislative process will work. We will have a conference report to resolve the differences. Judy Woodruff: What about health care? The polls have shown that was at top of mind for many of those who went to the polls, all of those who went to the polls in Virginia. Has the White House given up on getting health care reform passed? Because it’s clearly been moved to the sidelines as you have moved on to tax reform. Marc Short: No, we haven’t given up on that. That’s a promise that we have made, and we’re going to deliver on that promise. I think the reality is that the way that this will work is, we will need to do it on budget reconciliation next year. So, it will likely be a 2018 exercise. I think that what we found during the Graham-Cassidy effort — as you recall, that was an idea to block-grant dollars back to states to give them more flexibility on their health care plans — is that ending up gaining more attention and attraction. But some of the senators who are initially no were concerned about the process, and they want to have a longer process play out. But I think they are more receptive to the concept. So, we think that that has a lot of merit next year. Judy Woodruff: So, you do think it can be resurrected? Marc Short: Oh, we’re — we’re determined to make sure that we deliver on the promises of repealing what we think is crushing the American people and the health care system right now. Judy Woodruff: And, of course, I’m asking because this is something that was originally said this was going to happen right away, as soon as Donald Trump takes office as president, and here we are, nine months later. Marc Short: Well, sure. As I mentioned at the start, I think we were disappointed that that was something that many Republican had promised to do for six years. And they have a president now who is willing to sign it. And so we’re disappointed they didn’t get it done. But we’re not going to stop on our efforts to try. Judy Woodruff: Marc Short, the director of the White House Office of Legislative Affairs, thank you very much. Marc Short: Judy, thanks for having me. Judy Woodruff: We appreciate it.

pbs,N/A,Election 2017 showed Democrats are fired up to vote," Judy Woodruff sits down with Amy Walter of the Cook Political Report and Stu Rothenberg of Inside Elections to get a close-up look at Tuesday’s off-year election results and how the “Trump effect” is motivating Democrats. Judy Woodruff: And now that we have heard from both political parties, from the White House and from the Democratic Party, let’s get a close-up look at yesterday’s results with Amy Walter of The Cook Political Report and Stu Rothenberg of Inside Elections. Welcome back to both of you. Let’s just get a sense from each one of you about, you know, your main takeaway from this election. Across the country, Amy — we know we have been spending a lot of time talking about Virginia. But, across the country, Democrats say, yes, look at this, we’re pretty pleased at what happened. Should they be? Amy Walter: No, they should be. The enthusiasm factor is significant. Their voters are fired up at every level, and they are ready to come out and vote. A lot is organically. I know, Tom Perez, the head of the DNC, talked about organizing. I think that’s important. But I think these are voters who are just incredibly motivated to vote. And that’s the second piece, which is what they are motivated to vote for is not necessarily what’s happening in their district or their state. They’re motivated by Donald Trump. And, clearly, that was happening in Virginia, because it’s not just the governor’s race. When you look down at the state legislative races, Republican legislators who held on to their districts when Hillary Clinton carried their districts in 2016 or when the current governor carried their districts, they lost their seats. So, it is clear that there is a big Trump effect going on right now. It’s a referendum on this president, and that’s what we saw across the country. Judy Woodruff: Stu, what would you say? Stuart Rothenberg: I agree. The Democrats as a party are divided between the Bernie Sanders wing and Hillary Clinton wing, the pragmatists and ideologues. But they have one thing in common. None of them like Donald Trump. And they wanted to turn out to vote, and they did. So, it was — I agree. It was enthusiasm and it was Donald Trump. That’s what defined this election. Judy Woodruff: Well, let’s talked about who turned out and what they cared about, Amy. And I think we have some graphics here to look at that. Part of it was women. Amy Walter: Yes. Judy Woodruff: And looking at women based on their different education levels, women and race, what do we see? Amy Walter: Judy, do you remember, 2016, we talked a lot about white suburban women, especially white suburban women with college degrees? And those were the folks that Hillary Clinton was hoping were going to turn out and support her in big numbers. They didn’t support her in big enough numbers to win in places like Pennsylvania or Wisconsin. And even in Virginia, Ralph Northam outperformed where Hillary Clinton did with women, with married women, with college-educated women. In essence, it was, this election in Virginia was really about the suburban — you can call it a sort of suburban women’s revenge, that they came out at a level that was really pretty amazing for what it gave to Ralph Northam. Judy Woodruff: How much of a surprise was that, Stu? Stuart Rothenberg: Well, there was still a significant gender gap. We have had that for many, many decades. And the Democrats continue to benefit. But we’re seeing the parties change in terms of education and the coalitions. And so what I think we saw last night is just the trend, an ongoing trend where the Republicans are moving more downscale and the Democrats are moving upscale, certainly in terms of education. Amy Walter: And that’s what we saw too, that Ralph Northam didn’t do any better in rural parts of Virginia — the Democrat — didn’t do any better in rural parts of Virginia than Hillary Clinton had. It’s just that he did a lot better in the bluer parts of the state, so in those suburban Washington… (CROSSTALK) Judy Woodruff: They got their vote out. Amy Walter: Absolutely. Judy Woodruff: The Democrats got their vote out. Stuart Rothenberg: But the Republican vote held. The Trump vote held among white evangelicals, rural voters and older working-class voters. Amy Walter: That’s right. That’s right. Judy Woodruff: It’s just that, this time, the Democrats did turn out in numbers that Northam needed. Stuart Rothenberg: That’s right. Judy Woodruff: Stu, what about when you look at the age of the folks who voted? What does that tell us in Virginia? Stuart Rothenberg: Well, again, this is a split that has developed over a number of years. And what you see is younger voters, 18-44, Northam with a huge advantage over Ed Gillespie. These are voters who many of them, the youngest voters, 18 to 29, who didn’t turn out a year ago in the presidential election. And there was some question, I think, whether they would turn out this time. Northam isn’t not exactly Mr. Charisma. There’s the divide within the Democratic Party, as I mentioned, on pragmatism and ideology. But they did turn out in big numbers. Voters 45 and older, the two oldest demographic cohorts, much more than closely divided between the two parties, but with an advantage to Gillespie. And they also, of course, gave an advantage to Donald Trump last year as well. Judy Woodruff: And it made a difference, Amy. I was just looking at this, because the younger, the under 45s were 37 percent of the electorate. They were only more than a third of the electorate, but they were a big enough margin to make a difference. Amy Walter: That’s right, and giving the margins that we didn’t see Hillary Clinton get. In fact, this has been the argument that Democrats have been struggling with since 2008, which is, how do we get that coalition that turned out for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 to come and turn out when Barack Obama’s not on the ballot? And in this case, they gave Ralph Northam, who Stu is exactly right, he’s not the most charismatic, energizing kind of candidate, the kind of margins that they gave Barack Obama. Judy Woodruff: We also saw some interesting — and we reported on this early, Stu — and that is transgender were elected. You had one elected to a state delegate post in Virginia, other transgender candidates around the country. Is that the younger voters coming out? Stuart Rothenberg: I think in part. I think the advantage for the Democrats is that younger voters are more open-minded, more tolerant. They value diversity and multiculturalism. Guys  50-, 60-, 70-year-old white working-class voters are stuck in their ways. Their ways may be fine, but they’re not as receptive to change. And these young voters participating, it’s a huge boost for the Democrats. And, if you think about it, these people are entering the political system now or they have involved in the last 10 years. They are going to continue to vote over the next 20 to 30 years with their values. Amy Walter: Right. Judy Woodruff: Which raises the question everybody has, Amy, what does this mean, if anything, for next year for the big midterm elections? Amy Walter: Yes. So, the enthusiasm factor is significant. We have talked about that a lot on this show, that people who are energized, especially people who are angry, turn out and vote, that you don’t necessarily need to have perfect message — this is for Democrats. They don’t need to have the perfect message. What they do have is Donald Trump. And he is a great motivator to get their voters to the polls. But the next question’s going to come down to structure. Where Democrats did very well last night was in suburban Washington, places that Hillary Clinton had already carried. Can they win in places that Hillary Clinton didn’t win? Can they do better among those white working-class voters, rural voters? And as Stu pointed out, the margins there for the Democrat weren’t any better than they were for Hillary Clinton. Judy Woodruff: And you heard me ask Tom Perez to — what are you doing to appeal to these Trump voters, to these voters in red states and red places? Stuart Rothenberg: Well, in part, we have to see what develops. They’re a year away. These were relatively a handful of races in a handful of states. Judy Woodruff: Right. Stuart Rothenberg: And let’s see what happens with the economy, with foreign policy, with the Mueller investigation. But Democrats have to feel upbeat and enthusiastic right now. And we will see what mistakes or successes the president has. Judy Woodruff: We will let them feel good for a day. (LAUGHTER) Judy Woodruff: Stu Rothenberg, Amy Walter, thank you. Amy Walter: Thank you, Judy. Stuart Rothenberg: Thanks, Judy.

pbs,"Nov 8, 2017 5:25 PM EST",Younger voters drove historic wins on election night," Democrats of all ages and backgrounds went to the polls, motivated in large part by the election of President Donald Trump. But it was the turnout of one group in particular — younger voters — that may have helped propel candidates like Danica Roem in Virginia, who became the first transgender person in the United States to win a state legislative seat. LGBTQ advocates cautioned that it was difficult to read into voters’ motivations in backing Roem and other Democrats, like Andrea Jenkins in Minneapolis, the first African American transgender woman to win a race for a major city council seat. But several said it was likely not a coincidence that enthusiasm seemed up among younger Democrats in an election that reflected a shift in attitudes about gay and transgender people in power. “We are seeing more and more young people who have transgender friends, who have friends whose parents are transgender, or know someone who’s transitioning in their community,” said Rebecca Kling, an official at the National Center for Transgender Equality. Many Americans are “more familiar with trans identity and what it means to be transgender,” Kling added. Tuesday’s elections proved that as a new generation of Americans reaches voting age, the “more support there is for LGBT issues” overall, said James Parrish, the executive director of Equality Virginia, a nonpartisan advocacy group. “It’s a demographic that we’ve been waiting to come of voting age.” Virginia offers a good example of the way these cultural changes are impacting elections. The winner of the state’s closely watched governor’s race, Democrat Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam, received 1.4 million votes, roughly 400,000 more votes than Democrat Gov. Terry McAuliffe got in 2013, according to state turnout figures. Northern Virginia, where Roem beat state Del. Bob Marshall — a veteran Republican incumbent and self-proclaimed “chief homophobe” — saw the biggest jump in Democratic voter turnout from four years ago. And while a detailed breakout of voter turnout by age was not yet available Wednesday, exit polls showed Northam won a larger share of younger voters than Hillary Clinton did in the 2016 presidential race. Northam beat his Republican opponent Ed Gillespie by 39 points among Virginia voters aged 29 and younger, an eight-point increase over Clinton’s showing nationally among younger voters. Democratic candidate for governor Ralph Northam speaks after his election night victory at the campus of George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, November 7, 2017. REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein – HP1EDB80ANU15 Senna Ahmad, 25, a graphic designer from Gainesville, Va., said her number one reason for voting for Roem was the candidate’s support for a proposed mosque in Prince William County. “It resonated to see minorities supporting minorities,” Ahmad said, recalling Roem’s appearance at a public hearing on the project. “Because she showed up for us, I wanted to show up for her.” Ahmad also said she wanted to send a message to Trump, whose divisive rhetoric on race and cultural issues has angered Democrats and Republicans. Since Trump’s election, “you see a lot of hate coming out in the open that wasn’t there before,” Ahmad said. “I think one of the reasons young people came out [on Tuesday was] to show that this is something we’re against.” Angela Vang, a sophomore at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis and St. Paul, cheered Jenkins’ breakthrough election to the Minneapolis city council. “The fact that we elected the first African American trans woman to city council is amazing,” said Vang, 19, who is a member of her university’s Women for Political Change group. But Vang said she thought Jenkins’ race and gender did not define her campaign, especially for younger voters whose primary focus were issues like affordable housing and criminal justice. Sentiments like those reflect a growing sense that younger voters don’t fixate on gender, race and sexual orientation in making their political decisions. They also mirror trends in the public’s acceptance of homosexuality, according to a Pew study on political polarization released last month. The Pew poll found that 83 percent of Americans age 18 to 29 said homosexuality “should be accepted by society,” compared to 58 percent of people age 65 and older who felt the same way. Pew released new data Wednesday showing a significant gap in views on transgender issues between Republicans and Democrats. Yet despite these differences, Kling argued the country was undergoing “a shift from the idea of LGBT identity, or trans identity specifically, being the only thing people care about in candidates or political positions.” Now, Kling said, it’s become “just one part of their political identities.” Roem in Virginia exemplified this approach, said Gregory T. Angelo, the president of Log Cabin Republicans, the nation’s leading conservative LGBT advocacy group. “Her victory was unquestionably historic,” Angelo said. “What’s interesting to me is she made history without even trying.” By focusing on issues like transportation and infrastructure, “she never ran as the trans gender candidate for the Virginia House of Delegates,” he said. Republicans like Marshall, Roem’s vocal anti-LGBTQ opponent, should take notice, he added. “Bob Marshall presents a cautionary tale for the GOP,” Angelo said. “There is very little appetite among the general electorate, and among a growing number of voters in the Republican Party, to endlessly litigate LGBT culture wars.” Saher Khan contributed reporting.

pbs,"Nov 8, 2017 1:43 PM EST",Democrats dissect election results and find big dose of good news," TRUMP RESISTANCE IS REAL After a series of losses in red-state special elections, Democrats finally had the night they needed to prove the much-discussed “Trump resistance” movement can be an electoral force. They notched a showy win in the Virginia governor’s race, where Ralph Northam won by nearly nine points. The New Jersey governor’s race was a Democratic blowout. Maine voters approved a Medicaid expansion that was seen as a referendum on former President Barack Obama’s health care law. And Manchester, New Hampshire, elected its first Democratic mayor in a decade. Activists emboldened by Trump’s victory have long claimed they had the power to change elections. They finally proved it at the ballot box. TRUMPISM WITHOUT TRUMP DIDN’T PAN OUT Just before Election Day, former Trump strategist and Breitbart boss Steve Bannon credited Republican gubernatorial candidate Ed Gillespie of Virginia with rallying behind the president’s agenda, saying a perceived boost in the polls was an indication that “Trumpism without Trump can show the way forward.” But the opposite may be true. Gillespie may not have fully embraced the president, but he did his part to court Trump voters — including embracing the president’s rhetoric on Confederate monuments and kneeling by NFL players during the national anthem. He even received an Election Day boost from Trump himself in the form of robocalls that declared Gillespie “tough on crime and on the border.” But it was all for naught, as the lobbyist and former official in President George W. Bush’s administration was trounced by Northam. LOOK OUT DOWN BALLOT It may not have garnered as much attention, but Democratic gains in state houses could lead to lasting political consequences in Washington. That’s because state governments control redistricting, the once-every-decade process of redrawing congressional districts. The GOP controlled the vast majority of state houses in 2010 and used that edge to create advantageous political maps in many cases. If Tuesday’s results are a harbinger of what’s to come, Democrats may be poised to flip the script. In Virginia, Democrats picked up at least 14 House seats, and the state House majority remained in reach with a handful of races still too close to call. In Washington state, Democrats need to pick up just one seat to control the state Senate. Democratic activists are vowing to redouble their efforts in down-ballot races going forward. TRUMP AND GOP MAY HAVE A SUBURBAN VOTER PROBLEM In Virginia, Gov.-elect Northam more than doubled Hillary Clinton’s margin of victory, and the results can’t be solely attributed to anti-Trump enthusiasm. The GOP is showing signs of struggle in the suburbs, where Trump already had run weaker in 2016. That’s a sign of trouble for the party before the midterms. Take Chesterfield County, Virginia, a reliably conservative suburb of Richmond, where Gillespie underperformed even Trump. It will take weeks to precisely diagnose the drop-off in GOP support. But in recent years, the GOP has relied heavily on suburban votes to maintain safe seats in Congress, as they’ve used redistricting to carve out more favorable districts for the party. An erosion of support in those strongholds could have dire consequences for the party. READ NEXT: Danica Roem wins Virginia race, becomes first trans state legislator TAX REFORM JUST GOT HARDER It was never going to be easy for Trump and his allies in Congress to overhaul the nation’s tax laws. Facing a wall of Democratic opposition, GOP leaders have to persuade virtually every Republican member to support their tax plan. Some members serving in swing districts already were nervous. After Tuesday, it’s hard to imagine that vulnerable Republicans across New York, New Jersey and California are more willing to take a risk on taxes or any major policy that could hurt their constituents. Blue-state Republicans already have raised concerns that the current House tax plan largely wipes away the deduction for state and local taxes, which could be a major problem for residents and business in high-tax states. House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican, said Wednesday that it’s more important than ever for his party to pass a tax bill. For some of his members, it’s also more risky. Miller reported from Washington. Left:

                                    — Updated on Nov 8, 2017 12:47 PM EST",Maine governor says voters wrong to approve Medicaid expansion," Gov. Paul LePage, an opponent of “Obamacare” like his ally and fellow Republican, President Donald Trump, has vetoed five different attempts by the state Legislature to expand the program. But Maine voters decided the issue at the polls Tuesday, approving a Medicaid expansion under former President Barack Obama’s signature Affordable Care Act. LePage said a previous Medicaid expansion in the state created yawning hospital debts and failed to reduce emergency room use. He said he won’t implement the new expansion until it’s fully funded by the state Legislature. “Credit agencies are predicting that this fiscally irresponsible Medicaid expansion will be ruinous to Maine’s budget,” LePage said, adding that he will “not support increasing taxes on Maine families, raiding the rainy day fund or reducing services to our elderly or disabled.” READ NEXT: Why schools are worried about Medicaid cuts hurting special education Tuesday’s vote was the first time since the law took effect that the question of expansion had been put in front of U.S. voters. Maine has now joined 31 other states in expanding Medicaid. Its allot question became a referendum on one of the most important pieces of the Affordable Care Act. Republicans, including Trump, have tried numerous times to repeal the law, failing every time. Democrats in Maine immediately pushed back at LePage’s statement that he will hesitate to implement the will of voters. State Sen. Troy Jackson said Medicaid expansion is now “the law of the land in Maine” and Democrats will fight to implement it fully. Jackson is an ally of 2016 presidential candidate and U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is one of the most vocal proponents of expanding public health care coverage. “Democrats will not give an inch in this fight because it is a matter of life and death,” Jackson said. “We will give no quarter to anyone who tries to take health care away from those hardworking Mainers who have been allowed to fall through the cracks for too long.” Maine voters’ passage of ballot questions hasn’t always immediately led to changes of state law in recent memory. Voters last year approved referendums about school taxes, legalized marijuana, minimum wage and a ballot change that allows voters to rank their candidate choices, and none has been fully implemented a year later. LePage has said many times that he opposes extending Medicaid to able-bodied workers. He has reached the term limit allowed for Maine governor and will leave office at the end of next year. But at least one of the Republicans vying to replace him, former Maine Department of Health and Human Services Commissioner Mary Mayhew, also has expressed skepticism about the wisdom of expanding Medicaid. Mayhew said during a radio appearance Wednesday morning that she doesn’t think state residents were aware of the price tag of expansion. LePage has said he would have to divert $54 million from other programs to pay for the state’s share of the expansion cost. “It does not absolve the Legislature’s and the governor’s responsibility to comprehensively evaluate and do the right thing for Mainers,” she said of passage. Passage of the Medicaid proposal means an estimated 70,000 people in Maine can gain health coverage. About 268,000 people currently receive Medicaid in the state. Medicaid backers in Idaho and Utah have started similar efforts to get the question on their ballots in 2018. About 11 million people in the country have gotten health coverage through the expansion of Medicaid. Left:

                                    — Updated on Nov 8, 2017 1:18 PM EST",New Jersey politician who joked about women’s march defeated," Democrat Ashley Bennett, a first-time candidate who was angered by Republican John Carman’s remarks, defeated him Tuesday as he tried to win a second term as an Atlantic County freeholder. The board oversees government in Atlantic County, a region of about 275,000 people that includes the struggling Atlantic City seaside gambling resort. Bennett was not immediately available for comment Wednesday. But before the election, Bennett talked about how the meme spurred her candidacy. “I was angry about (the Facebook meme), because elected officials shouldn’t be on social media mocking and belittling people who are expressing their concerns about their community and the nation,” said the 32-year-old Bennett, an Egg Harbor Township resident who works as a psychiatric emergency screener in the crisis department at Cape Regional Hospital. Bennett plans to focus on economic development issues, noting the need to help lower- and fixed-income residents who may be struggling to keep their homes and the thousands of people left unemployed as some Atlantic City casinos closed. Carman said the meme was “a bad choice,” but that the women in his life were “strong and confident” enough to not be offended by his joke. He apologized a few days later, saying it was an error in judgment. Carman drew more attention last month for wearing a motorcycle jacket with a patch containing a Confederate flag. He said the patch had been on the jacket for years and didn’t have racial overtones. The 58-year-old Carman apologized to anyone who felt offended. Left:

pbs,"Nov 8, 2017 10:07 AM EST",WATCH: Confirmation hearing for DHS secretary nominee Kirstjen Nielsen," The confirmation hearing for Nielsen is expected to start at about 10 a.m. ET. You can watch live in the player above. Trump surprised many in his administration when he announced his decision to nominate Nielsen to run the sprawling agency, which has been leading the charge on implementing Trump’s aggressive immigration agenda. Nielsen had served as former DHS Secretary John Kelly’s top deputy early in the Trump administration, and she moved with him to the White House when he was elevated to Trump’s chief of staff. She is scheduled to appear before the Senate Homeland Security Committee on Wednesday for her confirmation hearing. It’s been a lightning-fast rise for the 45-year-old, who arrived in Trumpworld only after Trump won the election and joined his transition team, on the recommendation of several former co-workers, to helped guide Kelly through the confirmation process. Nielsen quickly earned the retired general’s trust, impressing him with her work ethic and command of the issues and standing out in a team filled with political appointees. Nielsen’s supporters describe her as a straight shooter, with a relentless work ethic and high standards. “Among an incredibly overburdened and hardworking staff, Kirstjen stood out in the sense that she was indefatigable. She would work long hours, she would never complain, she would stay until it got done,” said Frances Townsend, Nielsen’s boss in President George W. Bush’s administration, where she served as special assistant to the president and senior director for prevention, preparedness and response on the White House Homeland Security Council. “It was extraordinary,” Townsend said. Townsend said Nielsen was always the first to arrive in the morning and the last person to leave at night, and expected those around her to work as hard as she did. Townsend recalled how men would leave their suit jackets on the backs of their chair in the evening so it would appear they’d gone to the restroom instead of home. One woman, she said, would stash her purse in the women’s restroom so that she could sneak out on the sly. “She didn’t want to have her purse on her shoulder,” said Townsend of the Nielsen underling. “As her boss, I absolutely loved her.” It was one of several such stories. Two transition officials recalled how, during the lead-up to Kelly’s confirmation hearings, Nielsen became ill from working too hard and wound up coughing and displacing a rib while suffering from a bronchial cold. Instead of taking time off, however, she was back to work the next day. “No job is too small — or, should I say, no job is too big,” said Blain Rethmeier, who first worked with Nielsen in the Bush White House and is now working on her “sherpa” team. But those same qualities have also chafed some colleagues, both at DHS and the White House, who have been put off by her brusque, no-nonsense style. As she worked with Kelly to impose order in a chaotic and dysfunctional White House that lacked clear lines of command, people inside and outside the White House complained she was controlling access to Kelly, alienating staffers and failing to return phone calls. A constant presence in Kelly’s orbit, Nielsen quickly established herself as the West Wing “enforcer.” Similar concerns extended to the DHS, where current and former staffers recall her canceling other people’s meetings with Kelly if she couldn’t attend. For some at DHS, it was a shock that a person so polarizing and with minimal management experience had been nominated to run a department of 240,000 people that oversees the Federal Emergency Management Agency, immigration policy and the Transportation Security Administration, among other major divisions. When acting DHS Secretary Elaine Duke announced the news to senior department leadership in a hastily arranged conference call, she was met with what one person on the line described as dead silence. The person, like others, spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of angering Nielsen and compromising their job. Her supporters, however, have pushed back at that characterization, dismissing it as jealousy and, perhaps, sexism. “The people who complain, are, in my opinion, people who don’t work as hard,” Townsend said. Nielsen declined an interview request. Nielsen has experience on the Hill and created and managed the Offices of Legislative Policy and Government Affairs at the TSA. After serving in the Bush administration, she worked as general counsel and a president at the Civitas Group consulting firm, before founding her own private consulting firm, Sunesis Consulting, where she advised senior domestic and foreign government officials and senior private sector officials on cyber and preparedness issues. (She is also an avid surfer who played Division I soccer in college.) If confirmed by the Senate, Nielsen will be the first DHS secretary to have previously worked for the department, excluding “acting” secretaries. She’ll also be the first with a cybersecurity background. Frank Cilluffo, a former director of the President’s Homeland Security Advisory Council in the Bush administration, said that when it comes to the department, “she knows it inside and out.” Nielsen, he said, would be able to “parachute in” and speak to various analysts and teams in “the same language that they speak and understand the issues” She’s an “incredibly thoughtful” analyst, he said. “I actually think she’s a wonk at heart.” By PBS NewsHour Jill Colvin, Associated Press

pbs,"Nov 8, 2017 9:32 AM EST",Indicted Pennsylvania mayor elected to fourth term," Allentown Mayor Ed Pawlowski, a Democrat, beat Republican real estate developer Nat Hyman. With 95 percent of precincts reporting, Pawlowski had about 50 percent of the vote and Hyman 43 percent. Pawlowski denied accusations that he accepted more than $150,000 in campaign contributions in exchange for city contracts, asking voters in the heavily Democratic city to return him to an office he’s held since 2006. Hyman said he ran “to try and pull Allentown out from under the cloud of scandal.” “We’ve got a lot of great things on the horizon,” Pawlowski told cheering supporters at a local Lebanese restaurant after election results were announced. “We have a great city that is growing, that is expanding. We’re going to keep moving this city forward.” Pawlowski, a Chicago native, was the city’s economic development director before winning the top job a dozen years ago. He presided over the revitalization of downtown — hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of projects including a new hockey arena, gleaming office buildings and upscale apartments — thanks to a valuable tax incentive program passed by the state Legislature especially for Allentown. Pawlowski won re-election in 2009 and again in 2013. READ NEXT: Democrat Phil Murphy wins New Jersey governor’s race It was during unsuccessful runs for governor in 2013 and the U.S. Senate in 2015 that prosecutors say he abused the power of his office, making it clear to vendors that he expected campaign contributions in return for contracts. Following a two-year investigation of City Hall, prosecutors in July charged him with 56 counts, including bribery, conspiracy, fraud, extortion and lying to the FBI. Pawlowski pleaded not guilty and resisted calls to step down, insisting: “I know I’m innocent. I know I did nothing wrong.” His lawyer called the charges “outrageous.” A trial is scheduled for January. Hyman, his opponent, is an Allentown native who started the Landau chain of jewelry retailers as well as the large real estate firm that bears his name and has developed more than 1 million square feet in the city. Two other candidates ran as independents. Allentown’s Democratic city council president, Ray O’Connell, waged a write-in campaign. Left:

pbs,"Nov 8, 2017 8:09 AM EST",Democrats come close to retaking Virginia House," Democrats picked up at least 13 of the 17 seats on Tuesday they would need to retake the chamber for the first time in two decades. “It really is an unprecedented result we’re seeing,” House Democratic Caucus Leader David Toscano said. The last time Democrats picked up more than five seats was 1975, according to Toscano. This election season, with all 100 seats up for grabs, saw Democrats make their most energetic push in years to gain ground against Republicans. Sixty of the seats were contested by candidates of both major parties, more than in any year for at least two decades. The House gains were part of a stellar night for Democrats, who swept all three statewide races. Democrat Ralph Northam beat Republican Ed Gillespie in the governor’s race by nearly 9 points. Together, Tuesday’s electoral outcomes will be seen as an overwhelming victory for those opposed to President Donald Trump and as a potential predictor for next year’s midterm election, when control of Congress and many more statehouses will be up for grabs. READ NEXT: Maine voters approve measure to expand Medicaid In the run-up to Tuesday’s balloting, Democrats said they were confident, but many analysts had expected them to pick up no more than a handful of seats. Republicans maintained during the campaign that they would retain their majority. Their years in power helped them build up a significant cash advantage, and they argued that voters in local races care about local issues — not what’s going on in Washington. “Obviously, tonight was a difficult night and the outcome is not what anyone expected,” Matt Moran, spokesman for the House Republican Caucus, said in a statement Tuesday night. The shift in power could have far reaching policy and political implications. It will change the makeup of committees, and Republicans may no longer be able to block Medicaid expansion. Democrats in Virginia also will have greater leverage when drawing new congressional and legislative boundaries during the next redistricting. “I told Ralph I am jealous” of the legislature he will get to work with, said Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who fought the General Assembly unsuccessfully on Medicaid expansion for four years. It wasn’t immediately clear how long it would be before the full results are known. Seven seats were too close to call early Wednesday. Many of those could be subject to recounts if candidates choose to request them. In one race, only 12 votes separated Republican Del. David Yancey and Democratic challenger Shelly Simonds. Among the Democrats’ influx of candidates this year were a record 43 women, many of whom said they were inspired by Hillary Clinton’s defeat to jump into politics for the first time. At least nine of the new seats will be filled by women. Among those will be Danica Roem, who is transgender. A former journalist, she unseated Bob Marshall, one of the chamber’s longest-serving and most conservative members. Earlier this year, Marshall sponsored a bill that would have limited the bathrooms transgender people can use. Roem will be Virginia’s first openly transgender lawmaker. She will also make history as the first openly transgender person elected and seated in a state legislature, according to the Victory Fund, a political action committee that works to get openly LGBTQ people elected. Several other Democratic women also made history Tuesday night: Hala Ayala and Elizabeth Guzman — who both ousted Republican incumbents — will be the chamber’s first Latina members, and Kathy Tran will be its first female Asian-American member. In the Blacksburg area, Chris Hurst, a former Virginia news anchor whose journalist girlfriend was fatally shot during a live broadcast in 2015, defeated a Republican incumbent. After the shooting, Hurst became the public face of the grieving Roanoke station. Associated Press writers Matthew Barakat in Fairfax, Virginia, and Alan Suderman in Richmond contributed to this report. Left:

pbs,"Nov 7, 2017 11:17 PM EST","At Northam victory party, Democrats breathe a sigh of relief"," “The Democratic Party is back,” Tom Perez, the Democratic National Committee chairman, told a crowd of supporters at George Mason University, where the Northam campaign held its Election Night party. Party officials and activists also rejoiced in Washington, just two dozen miles away, as it became clear that Northam, the state’s lieutenant governor, had defeated his Republican opponent Ed Gillespie in a race that became a referendum on President Donald Trump. “Democrats can sleep easy tonight, wake up tomorrow and get right back to work,” said Morgan Finkelstein, the communications director for the Center for American Progress and a former Virginia Democratic operative. The Associated Press called the race for Northam at 8:12 p.m., hours before many expected a final outcome, a person close to the campaign said. The auditorium where Northam gave his victory speech was not yet full when the results came in. As the race was called, several supporters looked at their phones, then at each other in visible disbelief. The crowd erupted when Northam stepped on stage to deliver his victory speech around 10:30 p.m. “We will put the people of Virginia before politics, before party and before ideology,” Northam said. Gillespie struck a conciliatory tone in his concession speech, saying that he wished Northam “nothing but the best success.” Republican candidate for Virginia governor Ed Gillespie speaks to supporters after conceding the race to Democrat Ralph Northam in Richmond, Virginia, on November 7, 2017. Photo by REUTERS/Julia Rendleman The race had tightened in recent weeks, though Northam enjoyed a slight lead over Gillespie since the general election campaign began in June. In the final weeks of the campaign, Gillespie, a former Republican National Committee chairman, adopted Trump’s stances on controversial issues like preserving Confederate statues and railing against NFL players kneeling during the national anthem. But Trump never campaigned with Gillespie. And shortly after the results came in, the president tweeted that “Ed Gillespie worked hard but did not embrace me or what I stand for.” Northam won by seizing on anti-Trump sentiment and a strong state economy. His victory strengthened the Commonwealth’s status as a reliably blue state. No Republican has won statewide election there since 2009. Northam’s victory was fueled by increased turnout in Northern Virginia, the state’s most liberal region. The turnout signaled a high level of enthusiasm among liberal voters, something party leaders are hoping will carry over to House and Senate races in 2018. In Fairfax County, for example, Northam earned 44,696 more votes than Democrat Gov. Terry McAuliffe in 2013. Gillespie was hurt by low turnout in some conservative, southwestern Virginia counties that overwhelmingly supported Trump in 2016. He also faced criticism across the state for divisive campaign tactics. Democrats said Northam’s victory was a  rejection of Gillespie’s racially-charged rhetoric. Northam stood “up against hatred and bigotry,” said Virginia Democrats chairwoman Susan Swecker. The party’s success extended down the ballot as well. Democrats flipped several state seats, including several high-profile races. Democrat Danica Boem ousted incumbent Republican Bob Marshall to become the first open transgender woman to be elected to the House of Delegates. In Southwest Virginia, Democrat Chris Hurst also flipped a red district blue. The former television anchor became a vocal advocate for gun reform after his girlfriend, also a T.V. anchor, was shot at work. Left:

pbs,"Nov 7, 2017 10:45 PM EST",7 takeaways from Tuesday’s big night for Democrats," It was a big night for Democrats, who also captured the governor’s mansion in New Jersey and added a historic down-ballot win in Virginia, where Danica Rome became the first openly transgender person elected. Here are some early takeaways from the night’s contests, and a look at how the races might shape the 2018 midterm elections.  Democrats finally win After losing a handful of House races earlier this year, the Democratic candidate won what was arguably the year’s biggest contest — a governor’s election in a key (if left-leaning) swing state. Northam’s victory wasn’t unexpected, as he led in the polls going into Tuesday. But his win brought a measure of relief for a party that has struggled at the ballot box since Trump took office. Democrat Phil Murphy won the New Jersey governor’s race as well, giving the party two victories heading into the 2018 midterm elections. Can Northam’s centrist strategy work in 2018? Northam, Virginia’s lieutenant governor, ran as a moderate Democrat while also reaching out to progressives — a sign of how powerful the Bernie Sanders aligned wing of the party has become since the 2016 election. The approach worked, though some liberal groups were frustrated with Northam’s balancing act. Still, it’s unclear if Northam’s strategy will work for other Democrats. Virginia may be trending blue, but it’s still a swing state with plenty of very conservative pockets. Democrats running in more liberal states next year could run into trouble if they try to replicate Northam’s playbook. Embracing Trump has its limits As the campaign wore on, Gillespie moved closer to Trump, embracing the president’s policies and positions on issues like immigration and the debate over Confederate statues. He also ran divisive campaign ads aimed at energizing the conservative base. At the same time, Gillespie kept his distance from Trump on the campaign trail, reportedly never asking the president to stump in Virginia on his behalf. It’s impossible to know what would have worked best: embracing Trump even more, or running a more moderate and less inflammatory campaign. But one thing is clear: Gillespie’s attempt to split the difference failed. Identifying closely with Trump likely helped with conservative voters, but it also seemed to alienate some moderate Republicans, independents or Democrats. A blow to Trump Gillespie’s loss represented an indirect rebuke for Trump, the first by voters since he won the White House one year ago. Though Trump didn’t actively campaign for Gillespie, he weighed in with support for the GOP candidate as recently as early Tuesday morning. In a tweet sent at 2:56  a.m. Trump said that Gillespie would “totally turn around the high crime and poor economic performance of” Virginia.  By the evening, as early results indicated that Northam might win, Trump quickly distanced himself from Gillespie. At 8:40 p.m., Trump tweeted: “Ed Gillespie worked hard but did not embrace me or what I stand for.”  A state divided The early exit polls in Virginia mirrored the national exit polls from the 2016 presidential election. Northam won among non-white voters by 58 points (Clinton was plus 53 points with that group last year), and won the female vote by 19 points (Clinton was plus 13 among women). Likewise, Northam carried voters aged 18 to 44 by 26 points (Clinton was plus 14 with voters aged 44 and younger), and also outperformed Gillespie among voters earning $50,000 a year and less and also won among college-educated voters. What do all the numbers amount to? Democrats remain the party of young people, minorities, women, and college-educated voters. And despite the narrative that Trump rekindled the GOP’s standing with working- class voters, the Virginia race underscored that poorer voters also tend to back Democrats as well. It’s a portrait of a nation divided along class, gender and racial lines. Dems score down ballot successes – and make political history While most attention in Virginia focused on the governor’s race, Democrats also won several races for state legislative seats. Democrat Danica Roem defeated conservative Republican incumbent Bob Marshall, becoming the first openly transgender person to join a state legislature. Marshall called himself Virginia’s “chief homophobe” and was known for introducing the failed “bathroom bill.” Roem’s victory and other Democratic flips at the state were good signs for the party heading into the 2018 midterm. Christie era is (almost) over Murphy’s win in New Jersey officially made Gov. Chris Christie a lame duck. The term-limited Christie will leave office with low approval ratings, and tied to a president who is unpopular in the state. It’s not the ending many predicted for Christie when he cruised to reelection in 2013 and emerged as a rising Republican star. Then again, this may not mark the end of Christie’s political career after all. He appeared to fall out of favor with Trump after losing his role running the transition team at the start of the year. But once he leaves office, Christie might angle for a job with the Trump administration, and he could be rewarded. Left:

                                    — Updated on Nov 7, 2017 10:41 PM EST",Maine voters approve measure to expand Medicaid," The referendum represented the first time since the law took effect that the question of expansion had been put in front of U.S. voters. Some 11 million people in the country have gotten coverage through the expansion of Medicaid, a health insurance program for low income people. The vote in Maine was a rebuke of Republican Gov. Paul LePage, who vetoed five different attempts by the state Legislature to expand the program. It follows repeated failures by President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans in Congress to repeal Obama’s law. “This is an exciting night in Maine, but also an exciting night for the country,” said David Farmer, spokesman for pro-expansion Mainers For Health Care. “Voters have made it clear they want more health care, not less.” For supporters and opponents of “Obamacare,” Maine’s question took on the form of a referendum on one of the most important pieces of the Affordable Care Act. And it was taking place in a politically charged atmosphere with GOP efforts to undermine, or repeal, the health overhaul. Here in the nation’s Northeast corner, the issue was personal to many in a rural state that has the nation’s oldest population and the region’s lowest wages. Passage of the proposal would mean an estimated 70,000 people in Maine would gain health coverage. About 268,000 people currently receive Medicaid in the state. Maine’s governor blamed an earlier Medicaid expansion for increasing state hospital debt, and he opposes giving able-bodied people more access to Medicaid. LePage often summarizes his argument by saying: “Free is expensive to somebody.” He also warned that he would have to divert $54 million from other programs — for the elderly, disabled and children — to pay for the state’s share of the expansion once it’s fully implemented. LePage’s office didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Mainers For Health Care touted the proposal as a “common sense move” to ensure health care coverage for more people. Maine’s hospitals also supported the Medicaid expansion and say charity care costs them over $100 million annually. The initiative’s supporters have reported spending about $2 million on their campaign, with hundreds of thousands of dollars coming from out-of-state groups. By comparison, the lead political action committee established to oppose the measure has spent a bit less than $300,000. This may not be the last state vote. Backers of Medicaid expansion in Idaho and Utah have started similar efforts to get the question on the 2018 ballots in their own states. If it passes in Maine, some 70,000 people would gain health coverage. Left:

                                    — Updated on Nov 8, 2017 7:13 AM EST","Danica Roem wins Virginia race, becomes first trans state legislator"," Democrat Danica Roem, a former journalist, is set to make history as the first openly transgender person elected and seated in a state legislature in the United States. She unseated Republican Del. Bob Marshall, one of the state’s longest serving and most socially conservative lawmakers. The race was one of the year’s most high profile, drawing international attention and big money to the northern Virginia House of Delegates district outside the nation’s capital. “It’s historic. … It sends a message to politicians everywhere that the politics of bigotry is over,” Democratic House Caucus Chair Charniele Herring said. Roem will be the first transgender member of the House of Delegates and will become the first out transgender person to win and serve in a state legislature, according to the Victory Fund, a political action committee that works to get openly LGBTQ people elected and has supported Roem. Roem, who couldn’t immediately be reached for an interview Tuesday night, openly discussed her gender identity during her campaign, but it was far from her focus. Instead, she focused on jobs, schools and, with particular fervor, northern Virginia’s traffic congestion. She started pursuing therapy to begin her gender transition when she was 28, and said in an interview with The Associated Press during the campaign that politics should be inclusive of all. “No matter what you look like, where you come from, how you worship or who you love, if you have good public policy ideas, if you’re qualified for office, you have every right to bring your ideas to the table,” she said. She also argued that Marshall, who has served in the House since 1992, has spent too much time on social policy. MORE: Democrat Northam wins Virginia governor’s race. Here’s who turned out to vote A lightning rod for controversy, Marshall often drew the ire of even his own party. In addition to this year’s bathroom bill, Marshall was also the author of a now-void constitutional amendment that defined marriage as between one man and one woman, and sponsored a bill banning gay people from openly serving in the Virginia National Guard. On the campaign trail, Marshall and other Republicans repeatedly misidentified Roem’s gender. In a statement posted on his Facebook page, Marshall said: “For 26 years I’ve been proud to fight for you, and fight for our future. Though we all wish tonight would have turned out differently, I am deeply grateful for your support and effort over the years.” Roem, who sings in a metal band in her spare time, said she learned to listen to different perspectives and digest complicated policy as a reporter for the Gainesville Times and Prince William Times, skills she would bring to bear as a delegate. Roem wasn’t the only transgender candidate elected Tuesday. Tyler Titus, who is openly transgender, won a seat on a western Pennsylvania school board, The Erie Times-News reported. “2017 will be remembered as the year of the trans candidate – and Danica’s heroic run for office the centerpiece of that national movement,” Aisha C. Moodie-Mills, president &amp; CEO of Victory Fund, said in a statement. Associated Press writer Matthew Barakat in Fairfax contributed to this report. Left:

In New Jersey front-running Democrat Phil Murphy topped Republican Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno on Tuesday to succeed Republican Gov. Chris Christie. Northam rode to victory in part by tapping into voters’ regret at Trump’s victory in last year’s national election. Murphy had an easier pathway in New Jersey, where Guadagno contended with Trump’s and Christie’s unpopularity. Democrats were eager to show they could harness anti-Trump energy into success at the polls, while Republicans hoped to prove they could put together a winning blueprint in blue-leaning states.

pbs,"Nov 7, 2017 8:19 PM EST",Democrat Ralph Northam wins Virginia governor’s race," In Virginia’s hard-fought contest, Democratic Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam defeated Republican Ed Gillespie. In New Jersey front-running Democrat Phil Murphy overcame Republican Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno to succeed unpopular GOP Gov. Chris Christie. The wins in Virginia and New Jersey are a morale boost to Democrats who had so far been unable to channel anti-Trump energy into success at the ballot box in a major election this year. Roseann Petropoulos said her opposition to Trump led her out in the cold rain to cast her ballot for Murphy in New Jersey. “Trump was huge,” she said. “Because back in the 70s when we got civil rights for people, women’s rights, we have a chance for that to be reversed. It’s scary.” Northam rode to victory in part by tapping into voters’ regret at Trump’s victory in last year’s national election. Murphy had an easier pathway in New Jersey, where Guadagno contended with both Trump’s and Christie’s unpopularity. Northam, the state’s lieutenant governor, repeatedly tried to tie Gillespie to the president. His victory was in large part due to a surge in anti-Trump energy since the president took office. Democrats said they had record levels of enthusiasm heading into the race in Virginia, a swing-state and the only Southern state that Trump lost last year. Gillespie kept Trump at a distance throughout the campaign but tried to rally the president’s supporters with hard-edge attack ads focused on illegal immigration and preserving Confederate statues. The strategy was criticized by Democrats and some Republicans as race baiting, but drew praise from former Trump strategist Steve Bannon and others as a canny way to win a state that voted for Hillary Clinton last year. After Tuesday’s loss though, Trump suggested that Gillespie hurt himself by not more closely aligning himself with the president. “Ed Gillespie worked hard but did not embrace me or what I stand for,” Trump said, before pointing out that Republicans have won every special election to the U.S. House since he was elected. In Virginia, Northam’s victory is another sign of the state’s shift toward a more liberal electorate. Democrats have won every statewide election since 2009 and now have won four out of the last five gubernatorial contests. Northam banked heavily during the campaign on his near-perfect political resume and tried to cast himself as the low-key doctor with a strong southern drawl as the antidote to Trump. “We need comfort food, Ralph is comfort food,” Del. John Bell told volunteer canvassers at a rally over the weekend. A pediatric neurologist and Army doctor, Northam made health care reform a centerpiece of his political career and current campaign, winning key allies along the way. He was a leading opponent of a Republican effort to mandate ultrasounds before abortions in 2012, winning him strong support from well-funded abortion-rights groups. As a state senator he was a leading opponent of a Republican effort to mandate ultrasounds before abortions in 2012, winning him strong support from well-funded abortion-rights groups. Northam’s victory is a blow to Republicans, who were hoping that Gillespie could provide a possible roadmap for moderate Republicans to follow in next year’s midterm elections. Several Republicans have announced plans to retire next year instead of seeking re-election. Left:

pbs,"Nov 7, 2017 8:00 PM EST",Two longtime House Republicans announce their retirements," Twelve-term Rep. Frank LoBiondo of New Jersey declared in a statement that “our nation is now consumed by increasing political polarization” and “there is no longer middle ground.” The 71-year-old became the latest moderate Republican to leave Congress and open up a seat that will be ripe for Democrats to pick up as they fight to retake control of the House next year. Then, several hours later, seven-term Rep. Ted Poe of Texas, a conservative, announced that he too plans to retire rather than seek re-election to another term next year. Poe, 69, whose district covers parts of Houston and northern suburbs, said in a statement that “Thanks to the lord, I’m in good health, but it’s time for the next step.” He added that he was looking forward to spending more time with his grandkids. Poe’s district is solidly Republican and would be a struggle for Democrats to win. With the announcements from LoBiondo and Poe, the list of Republicans who’ve announced plans to retire rather than seek re-election is now near two dozen, compared to fewer than half-a-dozen Democrats. Although only a handful of the GOP seats opening up are highly competitive for the Democrats, the many retirements nonetheless are adding up to an increasingly rosy scenario for Democrats, who must pick up two dozen seats to win back the House. LoBiondo said the time is right for him to leave anyway because of term limits on his service on the Intelligence Committee and as chairman of the Transportation Committee’s subcommittee on aviation. But he also delivered an indictment of the current political climate. “As some of my closest colleagues have also come to realize, those of us who came to Congress to change Washington for the better through good governance are now the outliers,” LoBiondo wrote. “In legislating, we previously fought against allowing the perfect to become the enemy of the good. Today a vocal and obstinate minority within both parties has hijacked good legislation in pursuit of no legislation.” LoBiondo joins several other House GOP moderates, including Reps. Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, who have decided not to seek re-election in next year’s midterms. Also Tuesday, Arizona Republicans confirmed that another establishment-friendly House Republican, Rep. Martha McSally, plans to run for Senate for the seat being vacated by GOP Sen. Jeff Flake. Taken together, the departures of GOP moderates could result in an even more polarized House than exists today. In years past large blocs of moderate Blue Dog Democrats and centrist Republicans could sway outcomes on legislation, but the ranks of the Blue Dogs have already been decimated while the GOP moderates are dwindling fast.

pbs,"Nov 7, 2017 6:51 PM EST","Trump a graver threat to American democracy than Russian meddling, Schiff says"," WASHINGTON  — The House’s top Democrat investigating Russia’s election meddling on Tuesday declared that in many ways President Donald Trump is “far more grave a threat” to American democracy than the Kremlin. Rep. Adam Schiff cited a litany of actions by Trump, from appointing Cabinet officers with “direct conflicts of interest” and goals of dismantling their agencies to limiting Muslim immigration and discrediting federal judges. As for the president’s own possible jeopardy, Schiff said Trump is trying to disparage the credibility of special counsel Robert Mueller and the congressional panels that are investigating possible coordination between his campaign and Russia in the election that put him in the White House. “So no matter what is produced, he can say it’s a fake,” the California congressman said in an interview with The Associated Press. “I do feel our democracy is under threat,” Schiff said. Trump’s approach to governing, he said, “is a serious problem and in many respects far more grave a threat than anything coming from outside the country.” The interview came as Trump jetted across the global stage on his first official trip to Asia. But back in Washington, FBI and congressional probes continued to churn. Trump has insisted that the FBI investigation, including the federal indictments of former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and the guilty plea of former adviser George Papadopoulos, have nothing to do with him. “It’s disappointing, though hardly surprising, that Adam Schiff would make hysterical and demonstrably false comments about the president, and then claim to be objective in his oversight duties,” said Raj Shah, White House principal deputy press secretary. Schiff also had sharp words for Facebook, Twitter and Alphabet — Google’s parent company — who he said were stonewalling investigators about sharing data that could possibly link the Trump campaign to Russian interference. Among the questions Schiff said the social media companies could help resolve is whether Americans were surreptitiously targeted by the Russians in ways that were “sufficiently specific and overlapping” that they would have required input directly from the Trump campaign. When the companies were asked for such information, Schiff said: “They were noncommittal, but we will continue to press them.” Schiff, the senior Democrat on the House intelligence committee, also suggested that Russian contacts with Trump campaign aides George Papadopoulos and Carter Page were part of a larger Russian effort to infiltrate the Trump campaign and that WikiLeaks served as a Russian proxy to leak damaging information about Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton without involving Trump campaign aides directly. Asked if his House panel was investigating the president personally, Schiff said it was not focused on specific people. But he also said the probe could focus on Trump himself. “No one is off the table,” Schiff said. As House Democrats have pursued their focus on Trump and his campaign, House Republicans, urged on by Trump, have launched their own investigation of Clinton and her role when she was secretary of state in the sale of a uranium mine to Russia. Schiff accused House Speaker Paul Ryan of giving his “blessing” to a coordinated effort to handicap the Russia probe. “I think the speaker, ultimately the buck stops with him. And whatever he is allowing, he is blessing. And in this case what he is blessing is an effort that I think was orchestrated by the White House and its external allies to distract from the Russia probe,” Schiff said. He also said it will be difficult to stave off efforts by the Russians — or others — to interfere with the next presidential election as long if the White House doesn’t help get to the bottom of 2016 and Trump still denies there was interference to help him. In the meantime, he said, the time for clarity about the 2016 election is now. “We don’t wait until there’s a constitutional crisis. We need the White House to get the message now that there will be a dramatic pushback should he try to fire Bob Mueller,” Schiff said. “I think we’re all going to be held to account one day for what we did when our democracy was under threat.” Left:

pbs,N/A,"Closing gun background check loopholes may be ‘common cause’ for Democrats and Republicans, says Sen. Chris Murphy"," As more becomes known about the alleged shooter’s troubled past, lawmakers are looking at ways to address what some critics call a broken background check system. Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, has been one of the most vocal critics for reforming gun laws following the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School in his home state in 2012. We spoke a short time ago, and I started by asking him what needs to happen now. Sen. Chris Murphy: Well, it’s an open secret that the existing background check system is broken. And people are waking up to the knowledge now that the Department of Defense has not been uploading lots and lots of records of people who shouldn’t be able to get guns into the system. But the fact of the matter is, there are many states that upload almost no records to the background check system, leaving the FBI to go out and try to get those records through other means. That means there are hundreds of thousands of people who shouldn’t buy weapons who are either seriously mentally ill or who have been convicted of serious crimes who walk into gun stores and are able to walk out with weapons, like the shooter in Texas. Hopefully, this may be one of the few areas of common cause. I talked today with Senator John Cornyn, one of the biggest NRA proponents in the Senate, and we committed to try to work together on tightening up the existing background check system. This guy should have never gotten a gun, and, hopefully, Republicans and Democrats can do something about that. Judy Woodruff: So, Senator, you’re suggesting that the loopholes in the background system were well known. If that’s the case, why wasn’t it brought to the public’s attention before now? Sen. Chris Murphy: Well, it has been brought to the public’s attention. We have had legislation in Congress for multiple sessions to improve and strengthen the background check system. The House of Representatives passed funding a few years ago to give states more money to upload records to NICS. The Republicans in Congress have never been willing to move this legislation, have never been willing to fund states in order to put records online. In fact, they have been moving the opposite direction. Earlier this year, Republicans passed legislation that was signed by President Trump that took 75,000 people with serious mental illness off the list of people who are prohibited from buying weapons. It seems that, maybe in light of this tragedy, there is some willingness to finally close these loopholes and make sure that the background check system works, but everybody has known about this and many of us have been trying to fix it for years. Judy Woodruff: So do you think there is a genuine change of view on the other side? Sen. Chris Murphy: Well, I know that Senator Cornyn has been the strongest opponent of many of the commonsense gun safety changes, like universal background checks, that we have tried the make. And, today, he and I talked seriously about working together to try the make sure that states are uploading this information about criminals and people with serious mental illness into the database. And that’s not sufficient in order to protect Americans, in part because that only applies if you buy your gun at a gun store. If you buy it at a gun show or online, even if you’re on the prohibited list, you will still walk out with a weapon. But it’s a step in the right direction, if you can work together on this. Judy Woodruff: And you’re prepared to work with Senator Cornyn and others on this? Sen. Chris Murphy: I think you have the crawl before you can walk. And I am willing to do anything to try to show the American public that we are not just going to sit idly by and allow shooting after shooting to happen. I think, if Republicans can flex that muscle a little bit and tighten up our gun laws, maybe show a little bit of resistance to the gun lobby, they will find out that it’s not that hard and they actually get a lot of applause from a cross-section of their constituents back home. Judy Woodruff: But, just to clarify, the Air Force acknowledging that there was an error, you’re suggesting it’s more than just a single error? Sen. Chris Murphy: It is much more than a single error. The data that I have seen suggests that, while the military is uploading information relative to people who have been given dishonorable discharges, those that have been bad conduct discharges are very often not put into the system. It doesn’t look to me like this was an individual act of oversight. It looks to me like there’s a much bigger systematic problem that we need to fix. Judy Woodruff: President Trump, for the second day in a row now, he has commented on the shooting. Today, he is arguing again that it’s fortunate that someone had a gun and was able to use it on the shooter outside the church. He’s gone on to say more gun restrictions might have prevented this neighbor from doing what he did. Sen. Chris Murphy: Yes, I don’t know if anybody has told the president that 26 people died inside that church and that he was only pursued by civilians once he had murdered 26 people, including children and seniors. And despite the fact that Texas allows you to carry a concealed weapon almost anywhere, explicitly inside churches, this shooter, by using a military-style assault weapon, was able to engage in one of the worst mass shootings in American history. So, clearly, a good guy with a gun didn’t stop a bad guy with a gun this weekend in Texas. It is part of this absurd mythology that the gun industry has tried to perpetuate in this country, which is never, ever true. Plenty of places that have lots of good guys with guns have mass shootings that are not stopped in that manner. Judy Woodruff: I’m sure you know, Senator, even some Democrats have this view. On the “NewsHour” last night, there was a Democratic congressman, Henry Cuellar, who pointed out that people with guns could help prevent things like this. Sen. Chris Murphy: It’s just not what the data shows. And it’s not what the anecdotal evidence shows. There were plenty of people in Dallas with weapons when a sniper started firing from above the scene. There’s the ability in Nevada to carry weapons in public spaces. They didn’t stop that sniper. And, similarly, in Texas, some of the loosest gun laws in the world didn’t stop him. If you own a gun, whether you like it or not, the data tells you that that gun is much more likely to be used to kill you than it is to be used by you to kill an assailant or an intruder. That’s not my opinion. That’s the facts. Judy Woodruff: And, finally, Senator, the question of bump stocks, they got a lot of attention after the Las Vegas shooting. Where does that stand right now? Sen. Chris Murphy: Well, Republicans say that they want to work on it, but we have not seen any willingness to put legislation forward. The problem is the existing statute is truly ambiguous. It is not clear-cut that the ATF has the ability to ban these after-market modifications by themselves. And they have told us that. Thus, it’s up to Congress to make clear what we have always agreed upon, that people shouldn’t have automatic weapons. The ATF likely can’t do this by themselves. Congress has to do it. But Republicans who say they’re open to it don’t seem willing to actually put forward the legislation. We’re going to try to hold them to it in the coming days and weeks. Judy Woodruff: Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, thank you very much. Sen. Chris Murphy: Thanks. Watch the Full Episode Nov 07 By PBS NewsHour Nov 07 By PBS NewsHour Support Provided By:

pbs,N/A,How the Virginia governor’s race may test Trump’s popularity," Today marks the first statewide elections since 2016. The results matter, of course, to the local constituents. But races like the one in Virginia for governor are taking the spotlight for what they say about the national political landscape under a Trump presidency. We are going to break down now what is at stake in Virginia with Stuart Rothenberg of Inside Elections. Welcome back to the program. Stuart Rothenberg: Thanks, Judy. Judy Woodruff: So, Stu, why is this Virginia governor’s race getting so much attention? Stuart Rothenberg: Because, as you say, people are looking to this race as an indication of the mood, and is it changing? Are attitudes toward Donald Trump filtering down to the electorate and going to have an effect on this race? And could they possibly then tell us something about 2018? Judy Woodruff: So, you have a Democratic governor stepping down in Terry McAuliffe. And the candidates running, Democrat Ralph Northam, the lieutenant governor… Stuart Rothenberg: Right. Judy Woodruff: … running against Republican Ed Gillespie. What kind of races have they been running? Stuart Rothenberg: Well, Gillespie — it’s funny. Gillespie’s background is as an establishment Republican. He chaired the RNC. He was close to George Bush. He was on — he was an adviser to the Romney campaign. Yet, the more he’s run, the more he’s sounded like Donald Trump, talking about cultural issues, football players kneeling, Confederate statues and things like that. And so his campaign, even though Ed has a reputation as being an establishment guy, he’s running as a Trump candidate. Northam is raising the issue of Trump somewhat. He’s also trying to present himself as a reasonable governor, as not a lunatic left-winger. He’s a doctor. He knows people. He’s spent his whole life helping people. He’s running that kind of campaign and I think trying not to alienate voters along the way. Judy Woodruff: So, which groups of voters are we looking at? There is so much conversation about how Northern Virginia votes more Democratic, Southern, Western Virginia votes more Republican. Stuart Rothenberg: Yes. Judy Woodruff: What are you looking at? Stuart Rothenberg: Well, we’re looking at two things. We’re looking at the makeup of the electorate and how individual groups vote. Those are two slightly different things. If the electorate is significantly younger, that would be good for Northam, because younger voters tend to be more liberal, tend to be more Democratic. If the electorate is whiter than we expect, then that would be good for Gillespie, because that’s been the Republican strength and that’s his strength. So we’re looking to see which groups participate, and then how well the Northam and Gillespie do with each groups? So it’s one thing to say, yes, they’re a younger group, younger voters are voting, but are they voting more overwhelmingly for Northam, for example, than we would expect? So, it’s the number who are participating, but also how the groups are voting. Judy Woodruff: And in the polling that’s been done, what have voters been saying about what’s affecting their vote? Stuart Rothenberg: Well, we have some numbers right now, this evening. The early numbers have been released on some preliminary exits, just preliminary. Judy Woodruff: But on their opinion, not on how they voted. Stuart Rothenberg: Right. Right. This is just on — this is the exit poll on attitudes. And people — half the voters in Virginia, half the voters in Virginia are saying that Donald Trump is a factor, not the factor, not the only factor, but a factor in how they voted. And, by 2-1, those people tend to not be voting for Donald Trump. You know, candidates run campaigns. They talk about the issues they want to talk about. They emphasize their backgrounds. But even when they’re not specifically talking about Donald Trump, he’s there, he’s the cloud hanging over this campaign. And so I think he’s going to be a factor no matter what. Judy Woodruff: So, he’s obviously been tweeting about the race. Vice President Pence has been in the state campaigning for him. Former President Obama was in there competing for Northam. These candidates have gone in, but for the parties to try to influence. Stuart Rothenberg: The parties are spending lots of money, the Republican and Democratic governors association, interest groups, environmental groups on the Democratic side. So, yes, to some extent, the race has been nationalized, and also it’s Virginia. Half of the state is in the metropolitan D.C. area. So there’s no doubt that there’s something more here than simply two candidates. Judy Woodruff: We should say this is a state that — or you have said this — is trending Democratic over time. Stuart Rothenberg: Right. Judy Woodruff: Hillary Clinton won Virginia by, what, I guess six… Stuart Rothenberg: Five — by five points. Yes, 30 years ago, we used to think of this as a leaning-Republican state. And now I think we think of it as either a toss-up state or probably, probably slightly leaning Democratic. Judy Woodruff: So, for all those who are saying, aha, whatever happens in Virginia means this is what is going to happen next year, what do you say? (LAUGHTER) Stuart Rothenberg: I would say, hold on here. We are going to get some information tonight about how various groups voted or didn’t vote, participated or didn’t. We are going to learn something about how people feel about Donald Trump and about particular issues. It’s going to inform us over the next year. But, look, this is one contest, one election. Let’s not over-read from it. I think there are going to be some lessons, but be cautious. Judy Woodruff: Now, New Jersey is the one other state having a governor’s race today. The difference there is the Democrat has been running well ahead and is expected to win. Stuart Rothenberg: Right. Phil Murphy, former ambassador to Germany. It’s a Democratic state. The outgoing public governor, Chris Christie, is wildly unpopular. Nobody is looking for New Jersey to have any lessons here. Donald Trump didn’t win the state. So, no, if you’re interested in something in New Jersey, I will give it to you, Judy. Judy Woodruff: I’m always interested in New Jersey. Stuart Rothenberg: New Jersey 2, Frank LoBiondo, a pragmatic Republican, announced today he’s retiring. That’s another open seat. Trump won the district by about 4, 4.5 points last year, but Obama won it by eight points twice in 2008 and 2012. That’s a district I would look at. I think that’s more interesting than the governor’s race. Judy Woodruff: Ah. And I think I just read that Chris Christie got into an argument with a voter today somewhere in New Jersey. Stuart Rothenberg: He did? Surprise, surprise. Judy Woodruff: What a surprise. (LAUGHTER) Judy Woodruff: Stu Rothenberg, thanks. Stuart Rothenberg: Sure. Judy Woodruff: And you will be back later on as we update the West Coast. Stuart Rothenberg: I will. I will. Yes. Judy Woodruff: Thank you very much.

                                    — Updated on Nov 7, 2017 6:11 PM EST",WATCH: Senators introduce bill to stop those convicted of domestic violence from buying guns," The shooter in that attack, Devin Patrick Kelley, was convicted of domestic abuse by a military court in 2012. After Sunday’s attack, which killed at least 26 people and injured 20 more, the Air Force said it did not communicate those charges with the FBI, which means they were never entered into the federal database used to screen those purchasing firearms. Currently, civilians convicted of domestic violence are reported to the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), preventing them from buying a gun. Critics, including Donald Trump Jr., the president’s son, went after Flake on Twitter, saying such a law is already on the books and that the law was simply not followed by the Air Force. “Govt employees, like you, failed to do their job. He did a year for abuse &amp; fracturing his kids skull. Should not have had a gun!” Trump Jr. wrote. But Heinrich and Flake, who has announced he will not seek re-election in 2018, said only one domestic violence charge has been reported by the military to the NICS since 2007, indicating “a problem deeper than just the law not being followed.” (A ProPublica analysis  of Pentagon data this week also suggests the military is not reporting such charges from their courts to the FBI.)  The problem is with how domestic violence convictions are being labeled and how they are recorded, the senators said. The Domestic Violence Loophole Closure Act offers a framework to fix that problem and also creates formal oversight of how military convictions are reported, including an audit by the Office of the Inspector General, the senators said at the news conference Tuesday. “We need a clear procedure for looking at these convictions and reporting them in a timely and accurate fashion so that they end up in the NICS database, and that is not too much to ask,” Heinrich said. Republican Sen. John McCain, Flake’s colleague from Arizona, said in a separate statement this week that the Senate Armed Services Committee, which he chairs, would also conduct an investigation into the Air Force’s failure to report Kelley’s conviction to the FBI.

pbs,"Nov 7, 2017 1:45 PM EST","U.S. ends temporary residency permits for Nicaraguans, defers on Hondurans"," The administration is also postponing a decision until next July on how to deal with a similar program for 86,000 residents from Honduras. Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine Duke said Monday that the program, known as Temporary Protected Status, is no longer necessary for Nicaraguans in the U.S. Duke said temporary residents living under that permit would be allowed 12 months to allow for an orderly transition for their return and for their Central American homeland. Duke postponed a final decision in the case of Honduras in order to learn more information, automatically extending the current temporary permits for Hondurans in the U.S. for six months, until July 5, 2018. The department’s announcement came 60 days before the programs for both countries were slated to expire on January 5, 2018. The TPS program currently covers 435,000 people from 9 countries ravaged by natural disasters or war and who came to the U.S. —legally or otherwise— during the period their countries were covered by the presidential decree. While the status was meant to be temporary, it was repeatedly renewed by the Bush and Obama administrations over concerns that the countries could not cope with the repatriation of so many people former residents. Since taking office, Trump has ended the temporary permit program for Sudan and issued a shorter-than-usual renewal for nearly 60,000 Haitians, who were designated for temporary permits after the devastating 2010 earthquake. Immigrants from Honduras and Nicaragua have been able to renew their temporary permits every 18 months since 1999, when both countries were given TPS status by the Clinton administration due to destruction from Hurricane Mitch a year earlier. The Congressional Research Service said this month that only 57,000 people from Honduras and 2,550 from Nicaragua were expected to renew their TPS status. Left:

                                    — Updated on Nov 7, 2017 11:17 AM EST",A look at the top U.S. races on Election Day," Here is a rundown of the top races on Tuesday’s ballot: TWO GOVERNORS Voters in two states are choosing replacements for their term-limited governors — Democrat Terry McAuliffe in Virginia and Republican Chris Christie in New Jersey — in contests seen as an early referendum on the presidency of Donald Trump. In swing-state Virginia, most polls show a close race between Republican Ed Gillespie and Democratic Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam. In New Jersey, Democrat Phil Murphy holds a double-digit lead in the polls over Republican Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno.  Virginia voters head to the polls Tuesday for a hotly contested, off-year gubernatorial election. President Trump’s involvement in the race has been limited to four tweets, but polling suggests he is casting a very long shadow over how voters relate to the Republican candidate, Ed Gillespie, who’s embraced some of Mr. Trump’s signature issues. John Yang reports on the president’s role. The stakes are high as both parties seek momentum ahead of next year’s mid-term elections. Democrats haven’t won any special elections for Congress this year and the next Virginia governor will have a major say in the state’s next round of redistricting, when Congressional lines are drawn. Republicans are looking for a boost as their party is beset by intraparty turmoil between Trump and key Republicans in Congress. BIG-CITY MAYORS New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, made political missteps in his first term but is expected to easily defeat a younger Republican challenger from Staten Island, Nicole Malliotakis, and the private detective and TV commentator Bo Dietl. In Boston, Mayor Marty Walsh asks voters to give him a second four-year term. Challenger Tito Jackson, a member of the City Council, would be the city’s first black mayor. Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan is seeking a second four-year term against state Sen. Coleman Young II, whose father was the city’s first black mayor. Duggan was first elected after a state-appointed manager filed for Detroit’s historic bankruptcy. Nearly a dozen candidates are competing to succeed term-limited Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed. If the top vote-getter doesn’t win more than 50 percent, the race would require a runoff on Dec. 5. Two women — 54-year-old urban planner Cary Moon and 59-year-old former U.S. Attorney Jenny Durkan — are vying to lead Seattle, a city dealing with the benefits and problems of an economy booming for some more than others. Former Mayor Ed Murray dropped his re-election efforts — and then resigned — amid accusations of sexual abuse by multiple men. Charlotte, North Carolina, will be getting its sixth mayor since 2009. Mayor Pro Tem Vi Lyles, a Democrat, and Republican City Councilman Kenny Smith are running to replace Mayor Jennifer Roberts, who lost in the Democratic primary. MEDICAID Maine residents vote in the nation’s first statewide referendum on whether to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, a vote viewed as a referendum on “Obamacare.” Thirty-one other states have joined the expansion, but this is the first time it has been put before voters. The ballot measure comes after Maine’s Republican governor vetoed five attempts to expand the program. UTAH’S CONGRESSIONAL SEAT Utah voters are choosing a replacement for U.S. Rep. Jason Chaffetz after the Republican’s surprise resignation earlier this year. John Curtis, the Republican mayor of the Mormon stronghold of Provo, is expected to sail to victory in a congressional district where Republicans outnumber Democrats 5-to-1. He is challenged by Democrat Kathryn Allen and third-party candidate Jim Bennett. PHILADELPHIA DISTRICT ATTORNEY Voters in Philadelphia are picking a new district attorney to replace Seth Williams, who was sentenced to prison last month for accepting a bribe. Larry Krasner, a liberal Democrat who vows to end mass incarceration and the death penalty, is favored to win in the heavily Democratic city. His opponent, Republican Beth Grossman, has gotten a boost with endorsements from The Philadelphia Inquirer and the local police union. CONTROL OF WASHINGTON Voters in the Seattle suburbs will determine whether the Washington state Senate will remain the only Republican-led legislative chamber on the West Coast. If the seat flips to Democrats in a special election, Washington will join Oregon and California with total Democratic rule in both legislative chambers and the governor’s office.

pbs,"Nov 7, 2017 10:43 AM EST",NYC votes on whether to give Bill de Blasio a second term," The Democrat is facing a crowded field Tuesday, and polls show he is far ahead. De Blasio has campaigned on efforts to increase affordable housing and address his city’s high cost of living. He’s also cited low crime rates and touted his administration’s rollout of universal pre-K for four-year-olds. The mayor’s first term was dogged by feuds with Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo, and investigations into campaign donations and pay-to-play politics. De Blasio’s toughest challenger is Republican state Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis of Staten Island, who has called the mayor ineffective. He also faces several third-party candidates.

pbs,"Nov 7, 2017 10:39 AM EST",What’s at stake for the governor’s races in Virginia and New Jersey," In New Jersey, Democrat Phil Murphy, a former Goldman Sachs executive and Obama administration ambassador to Germany, holds a double-digit lead in most polls over Republican Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno. The Garden State is reliably Democratic, but has twice elected Republican Gov. Chris Christie. The race in swing state Virginia is much closer, with most polls showing a tight contest between Democratic Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam and Republican Ed Gillespie. It was the only Southern state Trump lost last year. A closer look: THE TRUMP EFFECT Unlike other high-profile elections this year, Trump has kept out of both races except for a few tweets in support of Gillespie. But he’s still been a dominant factor in the race. Democrats have tried to cast both gubernatorial contests as a way for voters to send a message against Trump. Northam has dubbed Gillespie, a former Washington lobbyist and Republican National Committee chairman, as “Trump’s lobbyist.” Murphy has promised to appoint an attorney general who’d fight the White House over immigration policy and called on voters to elect him as a check on Trump. On the Republican side, both Gillespie and Guadagno have kept Trump at an arm’s distance while mimicking his policies on certain social issues. In particular, both have pledged tougher policies for immigrants in the country illegally and blasted their Democratic opponents for support of so-called sanctuary cities. Gillespie has criticized Northam for favoring the removal of the state’s Confederate monuments. WHAT’S AT STAKE FOR REPUBLICANS A Republican sweep or even very strong showings would be a huge morale boost for a party whose officials have openly fretted about their electoral prospects next year. Former Trump strategist Steve Bannon has cheered Gillespie’s embrace of the Trump agenda, saying it shows a way for Republicans to succeed in future elections. Other Republicans have been highly critical of Gillespie’s campaign, accusing him of abandoning his big-tent principals. Gillespie’s performance could heavily influence how other establishment Republicans campaign next year, either as a model to emulate or avoid. A Guadagno loss in New Jersey means the GOP will drop from controlling 34 to 33 governorships. It would also leave Republicans totally out of control in state government, with the Legislature expected to remain in Democrats’ hands. WHAT’S AT STAKE FOR DEMOCRATS Democrats are also looking for a positive turn as they struggled with continuing recriminations about last year’s presidential election. Democrats have also been unable to win any of the congressional special elections held this year, despite heavy spending in some of those contests. Losses Tuesday would likely demoralize the party and lead to greater friction. Northam has already faced criticism from a variety of liberal activists for his campaign, with complaints often saying his minority outreach effort hasn’t been as effective as it should have been. A loss in New Jersey would be particularly devastating, as the party has nearly 900,000 more registered voters than the GOP and Christie is historically unpopular. WHAT ELSE IS AT STAKE? The next Virginia governor will have a key say during the redistricting, when the state redraws its congressional and legislative boundaries. Republicans currently control both chambers of the General Assembly, and a Gillespie victory would give the GOP significant leverage when drawing the lines. New Jersey’s governor is one of the most powerful in the country, appointing the entire state Cabinet, prosecutors, judges and a host of commission officials including state’s transit and turnpike agencies. There’s also the chance that the next governor could appoint an interim U.S. senator if Democrat Bob Menendez’s seat becomes vacant as part of the corruption trial against him. A Murphy victory could also entail legalized marijuana, which he has promised and the Legislature has indicated it supports. Catalini reported from Trenton, New Jersey. Left:

pbs,"Nov 7, 2017 10:26 AM EST",Democrats try to look forward but are still haunted by 2016," On Election Day 2016, Democrats suffered a devastating and shocking loss. A year later, they’re still sorting through the wreckage. The infighting, the divisive personalities and the questions about how it happened are still front and center, threatening to hold the party back in elections on Tuesday and into next year’s midterms. Hillary Clinton is on a tour promoting her book on last year’s campaign, entitled “What Happened.” The man she defeated in the party’s presidential primaries, Bernie Sanders, and former Vice President Joe Biden are the two top possible presidential contenders in 2020. And just in time for a crucial race for Virginia governor, the Democratic National Committee’s former chairwoman, Donna Brazile, last week reopened the wounds over whether the party tilted the primary in Clinton’s favor. “2016 may be the first year on record that is actually 23 months long,” said Jesse Ferguson, a former Clinton campaign aide. Ferguson, like many Democrats, is aware of the danger in dwelling on the past. He noted that, after Republicans failed to defeat Barack Obama in 2012, the GOP commissioned an “autopsy” that argued the party should moderate its stands on immigration to win growing minority communities. Really? Trump promptly won the next presidential election on a hardline immigration platform. “The biggest mistake we’d make is figuring out how we would have succeeded in 2016 rather than how we can succeed in 2018 and 2020,” Ferguson said. Trump isn’t making moving on easy. During the campaign, he gleefully stoked the Sanders-Clinton division, touting hacked DNC emails that purported to show how party leaders tilted the primary toward Clinton. He hasn’t let up much, now arguing that federal prosecutors should be investigating this collusion rather than his own campaign’s possible coordination with Russia, whom intelligence officials blame for the DNC hack. The president is pouring salt in what may be the party’s deepest wound. Sanders supporters pushed their own candidate to lead the DNC this winter, but Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota was narrowly defeated by former Labor Secretary Tom Perez and now is Perez’s deputy. Perez’s predecessor was Brazile, who is now is promoting her own book about last year’s election — and her take on the race is rattling Democrats. She claims she thought about trying to replace Clinton with Biden after the Democratic nominee fainted in September. And Brazile says a fundraising agreement between the Clinton campaign and the DNC gave the candidate too much control over party resources. Some Democrats were dismayed to see this division re-emerge just days before a critical race for Virginia governor where the party’s candidate is in a tight race. “We have a president who his dismantling every institution that we hold dear,” said Robert Becker, a senior adviser to Sanders’ presidential race, who was not critical of Brazile’s timing but wants recriminations to end. “It’s time to bury this hatchet. We need to get into the business of winning some elections here.” The party has several big choices to make. Some argue for a greater focus on white voters who didn’t graduate from college, a demographic that swung sharply to Trump, especially in the Rust Belt states that handed the president his Electoral College margin of victory. Others contend the party has to reach out to more affluent, college-educated whites who may lean conservative but are disgusted by Trump. Still others call for an intense focus on young, black and Latino voters to turbocharge the base of the party. “We’re only talking about 2016 in a way that will help us in 2018,” said Rebecca Katz, a New York-based Democratic strategist who has advocated for the party bringing in more liberal voters. “If we’re going to win in 2018, we have to get our base out to the polls.” There have been some promising signs on that front. Democrats have a shot at capturing the House majority next year, thanks to GOP retirements and solid recruitment of candidates in competitive seats. The Democrats need to flip 24 seats to win control of the House, and their top targets are the 23 districts where Clinton prevailed over Trump last year. The Senate poses a greater challenge, with 10 Democrats seeking re-election in states Trump won. The party is awash in new candidates and money is pouring in for its House races. According to an analysis by the publication Roll Call, 16 Democratic challengers outraised Republican incumbents in the most recent quarter. Meanwhile, the Republicans are engaged in their own brutal infighting. Two retiring senators have warned that Trump is a danger. Former presidential counselor Steve Bannon is seeking primary challengers to other GOP senators. The Republicans’ legislative agenda is at risk of complete collapse, and speculation swirls that prominent Republicans like Ohio Gov. John Kasich could take Trump on in 2020. The Democrats have dozens of elected officials thinking about the presidential race, but two party elders loom over the field — Sanders, 76, and Biden, 74. Still, Democrats argue that, unlike last election, no candidate has an obvious advantage with the party establishment. “No one is freezing the field this time around,” strategist Jim Manley said. Jeff Weaver, who was Sanders’ 2016 campaign manager, argues that the splits in the party are just the latest version of a battle that’s been raging ever since the 1990s between liberal activists and a more centrist establishment. “It keeps bubbling up, and until that’s addressed it’s going to keep bubbling up and continue to affect elections,” Weaver said. Associated Press writer Thomas Beaumont in Des Moines, Iowa, contributed to this report. Left:

pbs,"Nov 6, 2017 9:34 PM EST",Judge denies North Carolina’s request to drop election software from company targeted by Russian hackers," Lawyers for the state elections board said the Election Day poll book software that VR Systems provides to nearly 30 of North Carolina’s 100 counties hasn’t been officially certified. VR Systems persuaded an administrative law judge last Friday to side with the Florida-based company, which says the software remains approved under the original certification it obtained eight years ago, in October 2009. Superior Court Judge Paul Ridgeway declined to intervene, deferring to Administrative Law Judge Don Overby’s ongoing oversight of the case, including a proposed hearing set for next spring. The elections board formally asked the state Court of Appeals late Monday to delay the enforcement of Overby’s restraining order and preliminary injunction. The election board’s staff is still investigating what they call the malfunctioning of the e-books at five Durham County precincts in November 2016, which led officials to abandon the electronic system, issue paper ballots and extend voting hours. It’s unknown how many voters may have given up. State election officials also became worried after federal officials warned that Russian spies tried to target VR Systems and send malicious emails that seemed to come from the company to more than 100 local election officials across the country. State officials said none of the 21 counties that used the software in North Carolina last year received suspected phishing emails, but the problems haven’t been fully investigated. Lawyers for VR Systems wrote in court filings that a consultant hired by the Durham County attorney ultimately determined that the software didn’t fail or malfunction, instead blaming county elections workers for failing to prepare equipment properly to work with the software. Michael Weisel, one of the company’s attorneys, downplayed any Russia connection, and argued that the company has been trying to comply with a 2015 law directing that only certified poll books could be used. VR Systems had tried repeatedly to work with the state board without success, according to briefs, meaning the company can’t meet contractual obligations with the counties. “The record is replete with attempts to do that since 2015,” Weisel told Ridgeway, adding “this has nothing to do with changing the rules of elections, or hacking, or anything else.” Recent certification delays also are attributed to there being no board members to officially sanction the software, said Alec Peters, a state lawyer who represented the board. There’s litigation between Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper and Republican legislative leaders over the board’s composition. But Peters said the current software is very different from what was first approved eight years ago. The chances for errors Tuesday could increase if counties shift back to using VR Systems’ software rather than paper poll books or the state’s poll book software, the state’s lawyers wrote in briefs. It simply can’t be that an administrative law judge can alter election administration rules now, and that “there is no way that a court can review that,” Peters said. Ridgeway, in acknowledging the board’s request to intervene, wrote in his decision that that he lacked jurisdiction to consider an appeal when the VR Systems’ case was not fully resolved by Overby. In a statement, a company executive said it was pleased with Ridgeway’s ruling. Mecklenburg and Cumberland counties, where mayoral races in Charlotte and Fayetteville will be held Tuesday, have used VR Systems e-poll books in the past. In Durham County, the state elections board took possession three months ago of laptops used in the November 2016 election and started analyzing them as part of their continuing investigation, state board spokesman Pat Gannon said.

pbs,"Nov 6, 2017 6:33 PM EST",Debate over these bills could lead to a government shutdown," Most of Washington is focused on overhauling the nation’s tax code, but lawmakers face a combustible mix of must-do and could-do items, with the current government spending bill set to expire Dec. 8. On the list are immigration and a U.S.-Mexico border wall; an impasse over children’s health care; pent-up demand for budget increases for the Pentagon and domestic agencies; and tens of billions of dollars in hurricane aid. There’s plenty at stake for Republicans controlling Washington. Politically, there’s an urgency to avoid a debilitating shutdown just as the GOP hopes to wrap up an overhaul of the tax code that’s its top priority. And legions of GOP defense hawks are adamant that the Pentagon receive a huge 2018 budget hike approaching $80-90 billion. Trump and many followers want the U.S.-Mexico wall. Democrats retain considerable power in the endgame — their votes are needed — and are pressing demands of their own. They want protections for immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally as young children. They also demand budget increases for domestic agencies. “I think we’re headed in a good direction on the spending caps,” Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., said Monday. “I don’t know that will get to immigration this year but that’s a pretty easy thing to settle if the Democrats will give the president some of what he wants. I think he would be willing to be pretty forward-leaning on kids who were brought to the country illegally.” For his part, Trump tends to waver depending on the situation — siding with Democrats on a debt deal in September, promising Republicans last week that the controversial immigration issue won’t be part of the year-end spending measure. Meanwhile, the tax debate is taking up energy, time and political capital, and GOP leaders seem reluctant to issue controversial decisions that might harm its chances. Here’s a rundown of non-tax issues facing Congress and Trump: ___ SPENDING Ideally, top leaders in both parties would like to agree on new spending levels and pass a catchall bill by the Dec. 8 deadline. That’s looking increasingly unlikely. Another temporary funding bill would be needed to avert a government shutdown, but many Democrats say they won’t be able to support any measure that doesn’t include help for so-called “Dreamer” immigrants facing deportation. That increases the odds of a shutdown. Congressional leaders are conducting secret talks on raising the spending levels and say they are optimistic of a deal. But there’s no sign of one yet. A possible agreement could add perhaps $100 billion to the budget for the current year alone, which is sure to cause sticker shock among the GOP’s fiscal conservatives. Trump’s demands for the border wall — a nonstarter with Democrats — could spark a shutdown battle. Then there’s aid to areas devastated by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. The White House promises to submit a request later this month for “several tens of billions of dollars” aimed mostly at helping Texas and Florida. That’s likely to bring the total appropriated since September for hurricane relief to more than $100 billion, which is likely to rankle deficit hawks. ___ IMMIGRATION Trump announced in September that he is ending temporary deportation protections granted by the Obama administration to young immigrants known as “Dreamers” who were illegally brought into the U.S. and often have known no other home. But he gave Congress until March to come up with a fix and promised top Democratic leaders he would sign legislation protecting them, so long as he wins billions for border security. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus and Senate Democrats, such as California Sen. Kamala Harris, are demanding the immigration issue be addressed as soon as possible and won’t vote for any spending bill that fails to include a solution. That could doom the spending bill as Republicans need Democratic votes to pass the measure. Top Democrats such as Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York are keeping their powder dry in hopes that negotiations, which presently appear stalled, pick up steam. ___ CHILDREN’S HEALTH The reauthorization of an expired children’s health program is becoming more urgent as the lapse in the program will mean a cutoff in services in Arizona, California, Minnesota, Ohio and other states by late December or January. There’s a bipartisan desire to extend the program, but negotiations over how to pay for the measure have yet to produce a breakthrough. A compromise ultimately appears likely, and the measure is a candidate to be coupled with other items in December. ___ DEFENSE House and Senate negotiators are putting the final touches on an annual defense policy bill for the 2018 fiscal year that’s expected to increase the Pentagon’s core budget by billions of dollars more than the $603 billion Trump requested. There’s some urgency to the talks since Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., is battling an aggressive form of brain cancer. The defense policy bill is expected to expand U.S. missile defenses in response to North Korea’s advancing nuclear weapons programs. Lawmakers also are trying to resolve a long simmering debate over the creation of a new branch that would be in charge of the U.S. military’s space assets. Left:

pbs,N/A,It’s been a year since Trump’s win. What have both parties learned?," It’s been a year since Donald Trump won the White House. What lessons have Democrats and Republicans learned since that divisive 2016 election? For answers, it’s time for Politics Monday with Tamara Keith of NPR and Amy Walter of The Cook Political Report. Tam, Amy, welcome to you both. The big story, the headline tonight, of course, is this horrible shooting in Texas. Five weeks ago was the horrible shooting in Las Vegas. Tam, is anything going to happen? Tamara Keith: I’m pretty sure that Amy and I were here on this set a month and a week ago saying probably not. And, really, not much has changed since that shooting in Las Vegas. There was some talk, very briefly, about looking at bump stocks, which was this modification that was made to the weapon in Las Vegas. That talk has pretty much gone away. Now it’s another mass shooting, and in this one, there are a lot of children, and it’s tragic, it’s in a place of worship, but the conversation really doesn’t change. It sort of follows this cycle, and it seems to speed up, where almost immediately it’s either gun control or mental health, and people go into their corners, and they are very much in their corners already. John Yang: Amy? Amy Walter: Yes. One thing I would say, too, is that while we may not be seeing any change in the way the politics of this play out, I don’t think we should discount the way in which these events, which seem to be happening with really painful regulatory, are chipping away at Americans’ sense of safety and security, raising anxiety. When these shootings are taking place in places that should be places of safety — they are churches, they are schools, they are cinemas, they are concerts — you know, I think it really underscores the sense of instability and anxiety that so many Americans are feeling now just about the state of the world in general, but when they look at home, the feeling that they can’t quite be sure at anytime, anywhere, that they will be safe, and that the ground seems to be shifting constantly underneath them on so many issues, this issue of safety prime among them. John Yang: Instability, anxiety, shifting ground takes us to our next topic very likely, on a much sort of less threatening scale. It was a year ago this week that, Tam, you and I were in the Javits Center in New York, and the entire political world shifted, when both parties, I think it’s fair to say, were confronted with an election result that neither one really anticipated. A year later, where are the Republicans and the Democrats in trying to get their footing, get their — sort of reoriented in this world? Tamara Keith: Well, it turns out that winning for the Republicans didn’t paper over all of the problems. There are definitely divisions within the Republican Party, much the same divisions that we were discussing in 2016. As for the Democrats, losing didn’t prompt like a miraculous overnight rethinking and vision and thinking, like, oh, now we no how to proceed. I was talking to some women who had voted for Hillary Clinton, had volunteered for her campaign in the Cleveland area, and they actually said that they weren’t surprised by the election results. All three of them had predicted, they said, that she would lose before she lost. But as for what the next steps are, they are pretty frustrated with the Democratic Party. They are like, we thought by now the party would have figured this out. And there’s a sense that party hasn’t figured it out. John Yang: Amy, what — tomorrow, we have a big election in Virginia, the governor’s race. Is that going to give us a clue about where the parties are and where they are heading? Amy Walter: Well, we will read probably read too much into the results, as we always do, of one race. But let’s just look at a couple of things. The first is that the two candidates, the Democrat and the Republican, are not exactly fitting into the sort of traditional post-Trump stereotypes. The Republican candidate, Ed Gillespie is a longtime Republican, establishment Republican, moderate Republican, worked in the Bush White House. He doesn’t fit the stereotype of the outsider, brash kind of candidate that Trump is. On the Democratic side, you have, in Ralph Northam, another longtime establishment candidate. He’s got a Southern drawl. He comes from a part of the state that’s not the sort of fast-growing, urban Northern Virginia suburbs. He doesn’t act or speak like Bernie Sanders. And what both candidates are finding in this Virginia race is that there are sections of their party that want them to be more like the insurgents that they saw in 2016. Both of them are trying to thread the needle there, and we will find out in the next 24 hours or so which one was successful. We are also going to get our first real sense of whether there is a real enthusiasm gap between Democrats, who still are frustrated and furious about the results of 2016, and Republicans who, as you pointed out, John, were even surprised themselves that Donald Trump won. We saw in special elections in this last year and House races that Democrats did have something of an enthusiasm advantage. Is it going to translate into a state like Virginia, which is, unlike those special elections, it is more Democratic-leaning and it’s a state that Hillary Clinton carried? Tamara Keith: Yes, Democrats are under a lot more pressure with this Virginia race than the Republicans are, because Democrats have an edge. As Amy said, Hillary Clinton won the state. So, if Democrats lose, that’s going to be a really, really big story. If the Republican loses, well, you know, often that happens in Virginia, that the opposing party of the president ends up winning. And so, there’s more to lose for Democrats here. John Yang: And, Tam, we had more sort of — more fallout from 2016 over the weekend with Donna Brazile’s new book talking about having — sort of airing her complaints about the Hillary Clinton campaign, about the fund-raising agreement her campaign had with the Democratic National Committee. What do you make of all this? Why is Donna doing this? Tamara Keith: And then Donald Trump, President Trump, jumps in and tweets and says, look, it really was rigged against Bernie. That’s what I have been saying all along, because 2016 will never end. Donna Brazile has — is trying to sell books, for one thing, and so why do the juiciest parts come out? Because she’s trying to sell books. And also she has some real grievous from the way the 2016 campaign was handled and, you know, how the WikiLeaks affected her life and existence and what she thought she would be doing with her life. John Yang: Amy, is this division, this sort of fissure between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders wings that is now from 2016, is that going to animate the party through 2020, do you think? Amy Walter: Yes, I think the division that Democrats are facing is not so much between the Bernie and Hillary wing, but it is a general sense of where their strategy is, it’s more tactical, and it’s more fundamental to the kinds of voters that they want to see turn up and vote for Democrats. Barack Obama, when he ran for office, there was something called the Obama coalition, these younger voters, more diverse voters, who came and turned out in record numbers to support him. Since that election in 2008, those voters have turned out for nobody else other than Barack Obama. They didn’t turn out in midterm elections. They didn’t turn out for Hillary Clinton. So, there’s a group of Democrats saying, we have got to find a way to get those voters out and animated without Barack Obama on the ballot. There’s another group of Democrats, though, that say, our real challenge is that we lost white working-class voters by a bigger percentage than we should have in 2016. We need to win those voters back. They have got to figure out how to bring those two groups together under one banner and one message. John Yang: Not an easy task, it sounds like. Amy Walter, Tamara Keith, that’s Politics Monday. Thanks for joining us. Tamara Keith: You’re welcome. Amy Walter: You’re welcome.

pbs,"Nov 6, 2017 4:03 PM EST",What to watch in the Virginia governor’s race," The Virginia race has emerged in large part as a referendum on President Donald Trump’s divisive brand of politics, and the outcome Tuesday could shape how both parties’ approach the 2018 midterm election. Here are some issues to watch in Virginia ahead of Tuesday’s election. Keeping Trump (but not his policies) at arms length Trump’s presidency has loomed over the race in Virginia, forcing Gillespie to figure out how to run as a Republican in a left-leaning swing state that voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016. Gillespie, a former Republican National Committee chairman, reportedly never asked Trump to stump for him — and Trump stayed away from Virginia (and the New Jersey race as well). But while Gillespie never appeared with Trump in person, he embraced many of the president’s policies, as well as some of Trump’s positions on controversial cultural issues. Gillespie vowed to protect Virginia’s Confederate statues and criticized NFL players for refusing to stand during the national anthem. Gillespie also took a hardline position on immigration, in effect running on Trump’s platform without publicly receiving a White House seal of approval. A possible GOP template — or a cautionary tale? Will the strategy work? If it does and Gillespie pulls off an upset — he was trailing Northam by less than five points in most polls heading into the final week — his campaign could become the GOP template next year. If Gillespie loses, however, Republicans running in moderate states in 2018 may decide they can’t afford to shy away from Trump. The Democratic divide continues Virginia’s contest proved the Democrats’ internal divisions remain unresolved, one year after Trump’s surprise victory exposed the deep rift between the moderate and far-left wings of the party. On issues like sanctuary cities, Northam tried staking out a middle ground that appealed to moderate Democrats and progressives alike. The approach was somewhat of a gamble in an off-year election where base voters on both sides will determine the outcome. If Northam loses, he’ll face criticism that he didn’t do enough to energize the liberal wing of the party. It would also fuel the perception that Democrats remain disorganized and haven’t found a message beyond simply opposing Trump. Regardless of the outcome, the race has served as a reminder of the battle raging inside the Democratic Party. Riling up the base Democrats were hoping to enter the governor’s races having built some momentum with earlier victories in 2017. But Republicans dominated the special elections that took place after Trump won last November. Democrats now have a chance to bounce back Tuesday, and the results in Virginia, in particular, will signal just how motivated Democrats are to send Trump a message. A large Democratic turnout in the state’s more liberal northern suburbs would be a welcome sign for the party; a low turnout there would be cause for alarm. On the right, a strong showing by Gillespie in the southern Virginia counties that voted for Trump last year would reaffirm Trump’s popularity with his base. That would let Republicans breathe a little easier heading into the midterms (even if Gillespie loses). If conservative voters stay home, however, it would be a major warning sign. Left:

pbs,"Nov 6, 2017 3:18 PM EST","Republicans, Democrats spar over whether GOP tax plan would help the middle class"," Republicans focused on findings by Congress’ nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation that the bill would lower taxes across all income levels over the next several years. “Clearly this is helping real people. It’s helping teachers, it’s helping students, it’s helping struggling families that are living paycheck to paycheck,” said GOP Rep. Erik Paulsen of Minnesota. Democrats returned repeatedly to a section of the analysis showing taxes would actually go up beginning in 2023 for some 38 million taxpayers or families making $20,000 to $40,000 a year. “There are a lot of people expecting a tax cut who would be big losers under this bill,” proclaimed Democratic Rep. Bill Pascrell of New Jersey. “This is a joke and you’ve got to face up to it.” At stake is whether the GOP will succeed in passing the most sweeping rewrite of the tax code in decades, which would be a major achievement for congressional Republicans and Trump after a year largely devoid of legislative wins. And looking ahead to 2018 midterms where Democrats will aim to wrest back control of the House from the GOP, each side is trying to win the political debate over who is truly looking out for middle-class Americans. The legislation adds $1.5 trillion to the ballooning national debt, delivers a major tax cut to corporations, and repeals the estate tax, which would benefit a tiny percentage of the wealthiest families in the country. It also simplifies the loophole-ridden tax code by collapsing today’s seven personal income tax brackets into four, nearly doubles the standard deduction used by people who don’t itemize, and increases the child tax credit, an element championed by first daughter Ivanka Trump. Although several analyses have found that the bulk of the legislation’s benefits goes to corporations and the wealthy, Republicans argued vociferously that the legislation is targeted toward the middle class. “It’s about making America’s economy stronger than ever by delivering more jobs, fairer taxes and bigger paychecks across the nation,” said Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas. Brady is aiming to push the legislation through committee and to the full House later this week, and GOP leaders are aiming for House passage before Thanksgiving. The committee’s top Democrat, Richard Neal of Massachusetts, countered that the bill “puts the well-connected first while forcing millions of American families to watch while their taxes go up.” He complained that Republicans crafted it in private without input from Democrats. The tax proposal is the first major rewrite of the U.S. tax code in three decades. After embarrassing failures to make good on years of promises to repeal “Obamacare,” the tax bill is enthusiastically backed by Trump, House GOP leaders and many rank-and-file Republicans, who are promising a simpler IRS code, a more globally competitive business tax structure, and tax cuts for the middle class and families with children. But there’s considerable trepidation as well. In addition to the overall increases in later years for lower-income Americans, many earners in the upper-middle class, especially those from high-tax states, are facing tax increases. That’s because the measure would no longer permit taxpayers to deduct state income taxes from their federal taxes. Powerful lobbyists are fighting to protect favored deductions, while a few well-financed interest groups, including the National Association of Homebuilders, have already vowed to oppose the legislation. The homebuilders group has voiced concerns over Republicans’ decision to lower the mortgage interest deduction from $1 million to $500,000. Left:

pbs,"Nov 6, 2017 2:24 PM EST",Top deputy tries to distance herself from Chris Christie in New Jersey governor’s race," Gov. Chris Christie, the man she spent the last eight years running New Jersey’s government with, was nowhere to be seen. Guadagno has done whatever she could to create distance from a Republican colleague whose popularity has hovered in the teens and low 20s for the last year as voters have tired of his “tell-it-like-it-is” style and in the aftermath of the George Washington Bridge lane-closing scandal. With Democratic front-runner Phil Murphy spending millions to air ads highlighting the “Chrisite-Guadagno years,” Guadagno has struggled to get Democratic and independent voters to instead focus on her main campaign issues, including addressing property taxes. “She’s got the worst of both worlds,” said former Democratic Gov. Jim Florio. “The alignment with the (Christie) administration is inevitable. The overall impression of the administration is it’s not good.” In one recent Quinnipiac University poll, about half the respondents said Guadagno’s service as Christie’s top deputy was a negative factor for them. The poll surveyed 1,049 voters and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.2 points. Murphy, a former Goldman Sachs executive and Obama administration ambassador to Germany, has double-digit leads in surveys and a 5-to-1 cash advantage late in the contest. Christie swept to national fame after he was elected in 2009 as a plainspoken, charismatic reformer who went on late-night TV and made dad jokes at his own expense. He and Guadagno won re-election in 2013 by a wide margin, but the bridge scandal — originally launched as a revenge plot against a Democratic mayor who wouldn’t endorse him in 2013 — changed things. Voters also were upset with Christie at the amount of time he spent out of the state during his failed 2016 presidential campaign. In trying to escape his shadow, Guadagno hasn’t hesitated to pile on, comparing Christie’s $300 million plan to renovate the statehouse to the Palace of Versailles, mocking his use of a state police helicopter and opposing a gas tax he signed as part of transportation deal. “Anybody who knows me knows I’m not Chris Christie,” Guadagno said. Christie himself has kept a mostly low profile, saying that he hasn’t been asked to campaign by Guadagno. Guadagno, the state’s first lieutenant governor, says simply that she’s on the ballot, not Christie. She adds that she has disagreed a lot with Christie, but privately, which she says is the proper avenue for a deputy. Her candidacy has mostly focused on how to reduce property taxes and on banning sanctuary cities, but it comes as President Donald Trump’s administration makes national headlines daily. The one-two punch of Christie and Trump’s low levels of support in Democrat-leaning New Jersey could prove decisive. Democrats have 880,000 more registered voters than Republicans. “I think the electoral lines have really been drawn not by the candidates but by the incumbents, by Chris Christie who’s himself very unpopular and by President Trump who is also deeply unpopular in New Jersey,” said Fairleigh Dickinson University political science Professor Peter Woolley. Not everyone views the race through the Christie-Trump lens. Former GOP Gov. Tom Kean Sr., who campaigned with Guadagno this weekend along with former Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, said the public should get more credit for actually examining the candidates and the issues in the race, not just how they compare to Christie or Trump. “People are smarter than that,” he said. “If they’re paying attention, they look at the candidates.” Left:

pbs,"Nov 6, 2017 12:00 PM EST","Judge keeps Manafort, Gates under house arrest — for now"," Lawyers for Paul Manafort, who led Trump’s campaign for several months last year, and his business associate Rick Gates said in court that they were still working with prosecutors on a financial pledge that would guarantee their appearance at future court dates while allowing them to be removed from home confinement. But the lawyers said they had not made final plans yet, and U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson declined to take them off home detention until additional details about their personal wealth are disclosed, along with their commitment to forfeit millions of dollars in assets if they fail to show up for future court appearances. That means the men remain at least for now on home confinement, a condition imposed last week following their indictment. Jackson did indicate that she was leaning in favor of easing that condition while planning to impose certain restrictions, such as a bar on international travrl. Manafort and Rick Gates surrendered last week to face charges brought by special counsel Robert Mueller. The men are accused of laundering the profits of foreign consulting work performed on behalf of a Ukrainian political party and concealing those assets from the U.S. government. They have pleaded not guilty. In court papers, Manafort has pledged $12.5 million in assets to guarantee that he’ll show up for future court appearances. Left:

pbs,"Nov 6, 2017 10:47 AM EST",Trump says U.S. will arm Japan to knock down North Korea missiles," In his first stop of an extended trip in Asia, Trump stood with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at a news conference and suggested the United States will arm Japan, much as the United States has done with allies in the Middle East like Saudi Arabia. He did not deny reports that he has expressed frustration that Japan did not shoot down a ballistic missile North Korea recently fired over its territory. “He will shoot ’em out of the sky when he completes the purchase of lots of additional military equipment from the United States,” Trump said of Abe. “He will easily shoot them out of the sky.” Japan, under its war-renouncing Constitution, can shoot down a missile only when it is aimed at the country or in case debris are falling on to its territory. Some hawkish members of Abe’s Liberal Democratic Party say that it may be possible to shoot down a missile headed toward Guam in case it causes existential threat to the U.S. as Japan’s ally, but experts say that is questionable. Trump’s trip abroad comes amid dismal ratings among voters for the first-time president and questions about whether he can handle the nuclear standoff with North Korea. Standing in an Asia capital in range of North Korea’s missiles, Trump defended his fiery language, declaring Pyongyang “a threat to the civilized world.” “Some people say my rhetoric is very strong but look what has happened with very weak rhetoric in the last 25 years,” said Trump with Abe at the news conference. Abe, who has taken a more hawkish view on North Korea than some of his predecessors, agreed with Trump’s assessment that “all options are on the table” when dealing with Kim Jong Un and announced new sanctions against several dozen North Korea individuals. Japan is already seeking money to purchase upgraded SM3 interceptors with greater accuracy and range, as well as other advanced missile defense systems such as land-based Aegis Ashore interceptors or the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, a U.S. mobile anti-missile system installed in South Korea. An installment of THAAD in Japan would further escalate reaction from Beijing, which has already balked at the installment of THAAD in South Korea, saying its advanced radar system can monitor deep into China. Trump and Abe have struck a strong friendship, forged in meetings, phone calls and on the golf course — a friendship that was on display at a Monday evening banquet that was the final event of Trump’s visit. Abe called Trump his “dear friend” and hailed the benefits of what he called “golf diplomacy.” The two men on Monday also put a face on the threat posed by the North, earlier standing with anguished families of Japanese citizens snatched by Pyongyang’s agents. Trump and first lady Melania Trump stood with nearly two dozen relatives, some of whom held photos of the missing. Seeking to increase pressure on North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Trump pledged to work to return the missing to their families, saying “it’s a very, very sad number of stories that we’ve heard.” North Korea has acknowledged apprehending 13 Japanese in the 1970s and 1980s, but claims they all died or have been released. But in Japan, where grieving relatives of the abducted have become a symbol of heartbreak on the scale of American POW families, the government insists many more were taken — and that some may still be alive. Though Trump and Abe repeatedly touted their friendship, looming disagreements on trade could strain the friendship. Trump complained Monday that Japan had been “winning” for decades and rebuked the current relationship, saying the trade deals were “not fair and not open.” He told a group of American and Japanese business leaders: the United States was open for business, but he wanted to reshape the nations’ trade relationship, though he did not say how he would cut the trade deficit with Japan, which totaled nearly $70 billion last year. He also downplayed the potentially contentious nature of the negotiations, though the Japanese government has not shown much appetite for striking a new bilateral trade agreement. Tokyo had pushed to preserve the Trans- Pacific Partnership, which Trump has abandoned. “We will have more trade than anybody ever thought under TPP. That I can tell you,” Trump said. He said the multinational agreement was not the right deal for the United States and that while “probably some of you in this room disagree … ultimately I’ll be proven to be right.” Abe, for his part, publicly deflected questions about trade. Japan orchestrated a lavish formal welcome for the Trumps, complete with military honor guard and an audience with Japan’s Emperor Akihito and his wife, Empress Michiko, at the Imperial Palace. As part of the pageantry, Trump and Abe took part in a traditional feeding of koi in a pond Monday. At first, both leaders spooned out small amounts of feed into the pond below. Abe then lightly tossed the remainder of his box into the pond below, while Trump more theatrically dumped the rest of his box down to the fish. Abe laughed. Left:

pbs,"Nov 6, 2017 10:25 AM EST","Trump says south Texas mass shooting is about mental health, not guns"," Devin Kelley, the man authorities have identified as the gunman, was discharged from the Air Force several years ago for allegedly assaulting his spouse and a child, according to an Air Force spokeswoman. While no officials have publicly questioned Kelley’s mental health, Trump said that “is your problem here.” He offered no details. “This was a very, based on preliminary reports, a very deranged individual. A lot of problems over a long period of time,” Trump said when asked about the shooting as he and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe held a joint news conference in Tokyo during Trump’s first official visit to Asia. “We have a lot of mental health problems in our country, as do other countries. But this isn’t a guns situation,” the president said. The attack happened Sunday morning when a man dressed in black tactical-style gear and armed with an assault rifle opened fire inside a Baptist church in a small South Texas community, killing 26 people and wounding at least 16 others in what the governor said is the deadliest mass shooting in state history. Trump first tweeted that he was monitoring the situation from Japan. He later described the shooting as an “act of evil” during remarks to a gathering of American and Japanese business executives. Abe also offered condolences. Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek said Sunday that Devin Kelley served 12 months’ confinement after a 2012 court-martial. He ultimately received a bad conduct discharge and reduction in rank. Stefanek said Kelley served in Logistics Readiness at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico from 2010 until his discharge in 2014. He was responsible for moving passengers, cargo and personal property in military transportation. As Kelley left the scene, authorities said he was confronted by an armed resident who engaged the suspect, who later was found dead in his vehicle. Trump said “fortunately somebody else had a gun that was shooting in the opposite direction otherwise it (wouldn’t) have been as bad as it was. It would have been much worse.” “But this is a mental health problem at the highest level. It’s a very, very sad event.” The shooting comes just over a month after a gunman opened fire on an outdoor music festival on the Las Vegas Strip from the 32nd floor of a hotel-casino, killing 58 people and wounding more than 500. Trump visited Las Vegas soon after to meet with families of victims and first responders. In the days after the Las Vegas shooting, Trump and his aides declined to discuss possible changes to gun laws, saying it was too soon after the tragedy to discuss policy. Trump on Monday ignored shouted questions about whether the U.S. needs to consider tightening gun laws. Associated Press writers Catherine Lucey and Darlene Superville in Washington contributed to this report. Left:

pbs,"Nov 5, 2017 5:38 PM EST","One year after the presidential election, New Yorkers on how it changed their lives"," Afterward, as a number of pollsters, political pundits and journalists took stock of their disconnect with the country’s electorate, some communities celebrated while others across the country grew anxious about their future. New York City, which for the first time had hosted both Democratic and Republican election rallies and had heavily voted for Clinton, saw crowds take to the street in protest. Now, as the nation remains politically polarized and the Trump presidency makes headlines for an investigation into his campaign’s alleged collusion with Russia, the memory of election night remains vivid on both sides of the political aisle. As the investigation continues and communities organize for solidarity, New Yorkers from a range of political backgrounds reflected on their electoral choices and the year that was. Shahrin Azim appears at a community center in Brooklyn, New York. Photo by Pavni Mittal Shahrin Azim, student I have become more aware of my identity and how I appear. Every single day I have to prove to people I am not a threat, and we aren’t violent or trying to convert people or bring Sharia law. When the Vegas shooting happened, or any such incident, I am always thinking, “Please let it not be a Muslim person.” There’s always a double standard between white bodies and black and brown bodies. As a community we are back to square one [after a terrorist attack in New York]. They will use it against us. We live in New York and pride ourselves on our diversity, but we don’t stick to that. Lazer Zinger appears at his store in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Photo by Pavni Mittal Lazer Zinger, shop owner I believe that the Creator takes care of his world and doesn’t matter who the President is. Other people think differently and I am not arguing with them. I believe that there will come a day when everyone will see who is in charge of the world. I have faith things will be okay in the end. Antonio Alarcon holds a sign reading, “Undocumented &amp; unafraid.” Photo by Pavni MIttal Antonio Alarcon, DACA recipient It’s been a tough year with a lot of roller coaster moments. I am concerned about my other peers who are unfortunately undocumented and are in race for deportation. Now that DACA is terminated we don’t know how our data will be used. Since I am outspoken, I am concerned about the retaliation against my family members. But I have seen the resilience of my community which is no longer separated on issues. We have become one. Student Elena Hatib appears in Washington Square Park in New York, New York. Photo by Pavni Mittal Elena Hatib, student It’s very hostile. If you tell someone you’re a moderate Republican, they will assume you’re the alt-right or the worst of the worst. There is a very small percentage of people in that category but they have the loudest voice. It’s the same on the left. I think that’s something that college campuses have to get better at. Maybe if you sit down and listen you will respect their opinion. You won’t agree, but I think there needs to be that push and it needs to start with professors encouraging that in classroom, no matter what their political leanings are. Marni Halasa is running for city council in District 3 in New York City. Photo by Pavni Mittal Marni Halasa, figure skater and politician It was like the day after 9/11. It was almost as if someone had died. I teach figure skating and I had to counsel a lot of students. I also have a protest consulting group for which I don’t get paid. After Trump got elected, I was working more – I was protesting four to five times a week. This is a time for political resistance and people have gotten more politically engaged. I feel time is of the essence and there’s an urgency that wasn’t there before. I am now running for City Council. Rico Fonseca stands with his paintings in the West Village in New York City. Photo by Pavni Mittal Rico Fonseca, artist I hitchhiked from Lima, Peru and came to America. I contribute something to America and don’t turn against it. I am sorry about how Latin people feel. But I don’t have to be against Donald Trump just to be on their side. I behave myself, I don’t create violence or corruption, for the sake of being in this country. Angela Shef stands in the store where she works in Brighton Beach, New York. Photo by Pavni Mittal Angela Shef, Russian immigrant I watch Fox. What do I believe? I did vote for Trump. Would I vote for Trump if there was a different candidate, if there was someone other than Hillary? Probably not. I just didn’t want to vote for Hillary for a variety of reasons. But the reason I voted for Trump – there was no other candidate. Shakib Farah appears at the restaurant where he works in New York, New York. Photo by Pavni Mittal Shakib Farah, chef There was chaos and the whole Somalian community was in shock. [The travel ban] was a ban from opportunity. There was a lot more scrutiny, whether it is medical, cultural, educational tourism. We are struggling too. Matt Pasini stands on a train platform in Brooklyn, New York. Photo by Pavni Mittal Matt Pasini, actor It has definitely separated me from a lot of friends and family. My parents are Trump supporters and I am a queer person of color who is also transgender and they don’t grasp the idea how that is contradictory. [After the election] I got increased hate, as I predicted. Scott LoBaido stands with his truck, which he painted, in Staten Island, New York. Photo by Pavni MIttal Scott LoBaido, artist I had a studio in East Village in 1995, but [now] I am not welcome. That’s the irony of the politically correct storm. The art world is the most open-minded, tolerant in the world, unless you happen to be a Republican from Staten Island who doesn’t pronounce your r’s properly! That’s bias right there. My work has been desecrated before. It doesn’t hurt me. They burn it down, I put another one — bigger and bolder. Left:

pbs,"Nov 5, 2017 5:19 PM EST",Kentucky House speaker resigns post after texts with staffer," Jeff Hoover denied sexually harassing the staff member, but said he sent inappropriate text messages that were consensual. Hoover’s wife and two of his three daughters were in the room as he spoke. “I engaged in banter that was consensual but make no mistake it was wrong on my part to do that. And for that, I am truly sorry,” Hoover said. “I want to reiterate that at no time, at no time did I engage in unwelcome or unwanted conduct of any kind.” Thomas Clay, a Louisville attorney who represents the victim, said his client had “legitimate concerns about workplace conduct.” “Our client was not coerced by anyone to resolve the matter and has been satisfied with the resolution,” Clay said. “We look forward to moving past this matter.” Hoover said he will remain in the legislature. House Speaker Pro Tempore David Osborne will become the acting speaker. The resignation comes amid a brutal legislative fight to change the state’s struggling public pension system. Gov. Matt Bevin’s proposal would eventually end Kentucky’s pension system and replace it with a 401(k)-style retirement plan for state workers and public school teachers. The bill has the votes in the Senate, but not the House. Hoover had said he would not vote for the bill without changes, and he has been critical of some of Bevin’s comments about teachers and other state workers. “It’s fair to say I am not the favorite legislator of some in this capitol,” Hoover said without mentioning Bevin’s name. On Saturday afternoon, House Republican leaders announced they planned to hire a private law firm to investigate the allegations and would grant them the power to subpoena witnesses. A news release Sunday said the investigation will continue. Hoover said he received a letter on Oct. 17 from a lawyer whose client made allegations of sexual harassment against Hoover and others. He said everyone reached an agreement on Oct. 25. Hoover said no one admitted wrongdoing and everyone agreed to keep the settlement secret because the victim was going to keep her job. But Wednesday evening, The Courier-Journal reported the settlement, based on anonymous sources, which eventually led to Hoover’s resignation. Hoover has been speaker since January, shortly after Republicans won a majority in the state House for the first time in nearly a century. The victory gave Republicans control of every state legislative chamber in the South. “I have asked for and received forgiveness from God, my family, my wonderful wife, Karen, and my daughters,” Hoover said. “The decision today is what is best for Kentucky. And what is best for the House of representatives that I love and have spent 21 years here.” Left:

pbs,"Nov 5, 2017 4:29 PM EST",Ryan says health insurance mandate part of GOP tax talks," It would be another shot at further undermining the Affordable Care Act after repeated failures by the GOP-led Congress to repeal and replace the law, as President Donald Trump has demanded. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that repealing the individual mandate, as the requirement is known, would save $416 billion over a decade. The mandate provides a powerful incentive for people to get coverage before health problems arise. But the money represents a tempting revenue source for GOP tax-writers whose tax plan would add an estimated $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the national debt. Ryan told “Fox News Sunday” that “a lot of members are suggesting” that the tax plan repeal the mandate. He did not weigh in personally on how to deal with the coverage mandate. Rep. Mark Meadows, the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, said on ABC’s “This Week” that revenue counted through the repeal could in turn be used to soften the blow from the expiration of various tax credits and elimination of the deduction for state income and sales taxes. “We’re advocating on behalf of that,” said Meadows, R-N.C. The House and Means Committee planned to begin taking up the bill Monday. Some Republican lawmakers from New York and New Jersey have come out against the bill in its current form, saying that ending deductions for state and local sales and income taxes would hit their constituents the hardest. Republicans talking up the tax bill on the Sunday shows played down concerns that the bill would add substantially to the nation’s debt. It’s projected to increase the debt by $1.5 trillion over 10 years. “Preliminary numbers really look very good in terms of economic growth. So, over a longer period of time, some 10 to 15 years, we believe that the economic growth will outweigh any short-term deficit increase that we see,” Meadows said. “These so-called budget hawks have turned into an extinct, endangered species,” said House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California during an appearance on CNN’s “State of the Union.” Left:

pbs,"Nov 5, 2017 10:45 AM EST",‘Bleak’ assessment of toll of destroying North Korea nukes," “It is the most bleak assessment,” Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Sunday. Two House Democrats, in a letter to the Pentagon, had asked about casualty assessments in a possible conflict with North Korea, and Rear Adm. Michael J. Dumont of the Joint Staff responded on behalf of the Defense Department. Dumont noted that the United States is evaluating North Korea’s ability to target heavily populated areas of South Korea with long-range artillery, rockets and ballistic missiles. He pointed out that Seoul, the South’s capital with a population of 25 million, is just 35 miles from the demilitarized zone that separates the two Koreas. The amount of casualties would differ depending on the advance warning and the ability of U.S. and South Korea forces to counter these attacks, he told Reps. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., and Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz. “A classified briefing would be the best place to discuss in detail the capability of the U.S. and its allies to discuss capabilities to counter North Korea’s ability to respond with a nuclear weapon and eliminate North Korea’s nuclear weapons located in deeply buried, underground facilities,” Dumont said. He also mentioned the possibility that chemical and biological weapons might be used by the North in case of a conflict. Feinstein said she was pleased that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was accompanying President Donald Trump during his Asia trip, when North Korea is a main issue. “I think if he will stay the course and use diplomacy the way diplomacy can be used, then it might be possible to work something out. The worst alternative is a war which could become nuclear,” Feinstein told CNN’s “State of the Union.” In a joint statement Saturday, 15 Democratic lawmakers and one Republican— all military veterans — called the assessment that a ground invasion would be required to destroy the North’s nuclear arsenal “deeply disturbing” and that such an action “could result in hundreds of thousands, or even millions of deaths in just the first few days of fighting.” “It is our intent to have a full public accounting of the potential cost of war, so the American people understand the commitment we would be making as a nation if we were to pursue military action,” the lawmakers said. They also said the Trump administration “has failed to articulate any plans to prevent the military conflict from expanding beyond the Korean Peninsula and to manage what happens after the conflict is over.” “With that in mind, the thought of sending troops into harm’s way and expending resources on another potentially unwinnable war is chilling.

pbs,"Nov 4, 2017 11:02 PM EST",Police: Sen. Paul suffers minor injury in assault at home," Kentucky State Police said in a news release that Paul suffered a minor injury when 59-year-old Rene Boucher assaulted him at his Warren County home on Friday afternoon. The release did not provide details of the assault or the nature of Paul’s injury. In a statement, Paul spokeswoman Kelsey Cooper said the Republican senator is “fine.” The statement said Paul was “blindsided” by the assault but she did not provide further details. Boucher, of Bowling Green, is charged with fourth-degree assault with a minor injury, a misdemeanor. He is being held at Warren County’s jail on $5,000 bond. An automated phone system at the jail did not provide access to lawyer information for Boucher. Kentucky State Police Master Trooper Jeremy Hodges said he could not release details of the assault because of security issues. Hodges did say that Boucher is an acquaintance of Paul, an ophthalmologist who was elected to the Senate in 2010. It was not immediately clear how they knew each other. Hodges said Boucher would have faced more serious charges if had he used a weapon or if Paul had been injured seriously. “If he was using any type of a dangerous instrument, then it would have been a felony charge,” Hodges said by telephone Saturday.

pbs,"Nov 4, 2017 4:58 PM EST",Brazile says she considered replacing Clinton with Biden," Donna Brazile makes the revelation in a memoir being released Tuesday. This is according to The Washington Post, which obtained an advance copy of the book. Brazile writes that she considered initiating Clinton’s removal after she collapsed while leaving a 9/11 memorial service in New York City. Clinton later acknowledged she was suffering from pneumonia. But Brazile says the larger issue was that her campaign was “anemic” and had taken on “the odor of failure.” Ultimately, the DNC head says she thought of Clinton and all the women in the country who were so excited about her and decided she “could not do this to them.”  Left:

pbs,N/A,Investigation shows widespread abuse in Florida juvenile detention," A Miami Herald investigation into Florida’s juvenile justice system depicts a harsh and violent culture for teens behind bars. The story, “Fight Club,” revealed steady beatings by guards who also forced young prisoners to fight each other. The series is based on interviews as well as an in-depth review of documents and surveillance videos. As a result of the reporting, Florida lawmakers have made two surprise visits to juvenile detention facilities to inspect conditions themselves. Miami Herald senior investigative reporter Carol Marbin Miller is one of the authors of the series, and I recently spoke to her about it. For people who haven’t seen the report yet, first of all, what did it find? Carol Marbin Miller: Well we looked at 10 years’ worth of data that we obtained from the State Department of Juvenile Justice. We found widespread use of unnecessary and excessive force. We found a number of instances in which officers and youth workers outsourced discipline. What they were doing is, offering honey buns and other treats to detainees to get them to beat up other kids who were unruly. We found rampant sexual misconduct and we found that over many years there was a persistent problem of medical neglect. Hari Sreenivasan: How pervasive was this? Carol Marbin Miller: Well it’s it’s hard for us to say precisely how widespread it was because we did not have access to all of the reports. What we did was we got a spreadsheet from the state with about 20,000 rows of data and we went through the spreadsheet and we requested cases that looked interesting to us. And in so doing, we found cases of outsourcing of discipline all over the state of Florida and what we read in those reports was remarkably consistent across jurisdictions, where the youths were using the same language. We also found videos that were very disturbing, in which you can see these kids fighting each other with officers or youth workers right there, appearing as if they’re refereeing these bouts. Hari Sreenivasan: Now who are these officers? What are their backgrounds? Carol Marbin Miller: That’s one of the problems that we identified is the officers in the lockups and the youth workers in the commitment facilities were not professional staff. We drilled down into the background of many of these workers. We found some of them had criminal histories that were not much better than the youths they were supervising. We found there were a large number of men and women who had been hired by either the state or a private provider after they’d been fired for misconduct by a state prison or a local police department. Hari Sreenivasan: You detailed so many particular cases where kids were just brutally beaten to within an inch of their life, or in a couple of cases had lost their lives. Have any of these people been charged for criminal misconduct? Carol Marbin Miller: There have been a handful of cases where youth workers who used, you know, really egregiously excessive force were criminally charged and a handful of convictions that we saw. With regard to the children who lost their lives, we are not aware of a single instance in which a worker was sent to prison for wrongdoing. Hari Sreenivasan: But what about the Department of Juvenile Justice? What’s their response been? Carol Marbin Miller: In the hearings that have been held since we published, they have acknowledged that all of the facts of this series were accurate. They have argued that the Herald was not fair to them. They say that we did not give them adequate credit for some reforms in recent years. We did give them credit, for instance, for the civil citation program that was launched in 2011, in which kids who commit non-violent non-serious offenses can be given the equivalent of a ticket and they have or avoid getting arrested and sent to a youth facility. DJJ also is taking credit for the significant reduction in youth crime. That’s kind of a stretch, however, in that youth crime nationwide has been reduced by greater than 50 percent in the last decade. That’s happened all over the country. We have seen this very significant reduction in youth criminality across the board. Hari Sreenivasan: What’s the response been to your articles? Carol Marbin Miller: There was a bill filed last week by a couple of lawmakers who want the authority to go into these facilities without giving advance notice to the state. There are other ideas that are being bounced around a couple of Senate committees that have held hearings right after our series ran. One proposal would be to have the equivalent of school resource, resource officers inside every one of these facilities so that you would have an independent set of eyes and ears watching what’s going on, and folks who would be able to report misconduct to an entity separate from the Department of Juvenile Justice.  Hari Sreenivasan: All right. The investigation is called “Fight Club” by the Miami Herald. We’re joined by Carole Marbin Miller. Thanks so much for joining us.  Carol Marbin Miller: Thanks for having me. Watch the Full Episode Sep 21 By Evie Blad, Education Week Jul 22 By Kamala Kelkar Nov 11 By Eric Tucker, Associated Press Support Provided By:

pbs,"Nov 4, 2017 2:21 PM EST",Terror attack highlights de Blasio’s strained relationships," “This was an act of terror, and a particularly cowardly act of terror,” a solemn de Blasio declared less than a day after a man driving a pickup truck killed eight people on a Manhattan bike path. “We know this action was intended to break our spirit. But we also know New Yorkers are strong, New Yorkers are resilient and our spirit will never be moved by an act of violence.” It was not a moment the first-term Democrat wanted, but one that colors the final-days sprint to Tuesday’s election. Facing little more than token opposition, de Blasio is still expected to cruise to victory. But the attack highlights his complicated relationships with Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Republican President Donald Trump — relationships that may be moving in opposite directions as he moves closer to securing a second term as chief executive of America’s largest city. In a city where Democrats outnumber Republicans 6 to 1, de Blasio has lashed out at Trump with increasingly frequency as Election Day approaches. On the eve of the attack, he vowed to “stand up to Donald Trump every single day” during a campaign rally in which he and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent, took turns bashing the Trump White House. He softened his tone only briefly in the hours after the attack, jabbing the president without using his name for calling for a crackdown on some legal immigration in the wake of the New York City attack. Like most elected officials in blue states, the mayor has long opposed Trump’s push to ban on immigration from several majority-Muslim nations. “There should be very, very careful vetting of anyone where there is an indication of a concern, but not because of their religion, or not because of their country of origin,” the 56-year-old de Blasio said. READ NEXT: Using media literacy with students to discuss New York City terror attack The mayor’s leadership in the days after the attack, and his repeated attacks against Trump, bother independent mayoral candidate Bo Dietl, 66, a former police detective. The New York City mayor needs to have a good relationship with the president, Dietl said, to ensure the White House doesn’t retaliate by withholding federal funding for public safety. “This man is such a nonsensical idiot. He can’t even sit down with the president. That means for the next four years we’re not going to get federal money for our cops?” Dietl said in an interview. “This terrorist attack really made people re-look at this and say, ‘Do we really want a big bird to protect us?'” At the same time, de Blasio’s turbulent relationship with Cuomo showed mild signs of improvement. Despite both being Democrats, Cuomo has jabbed de Blasio’s leadership and policies for much of his first term. The clash is a political distraction at best, and at worst, an impediment to governance in a city in which the state government plays a significant role in public transportation and education, among other areas. A week before the attack, Cuomo seized on a photo of a homeless man sleeping on the subway to ding the mayor. De Blasio press conferences often feature multiple questions about the feud. “It’s no secret that there’s no great love lost between the two of them — two alpha male politicians in powerful positions,” said Bill Bratton, the city police commissioner under de Blasio until 2016. “They have to work together. Sometimes they do and sometimes they don’t.” Bratton added, “But in moments of crisis, those political differences are put aside for the public good.” Indeed, Cuomo and de Blasio stood side-by-side in the days after the attack, united in their condemnation of terrorism and Trump’s decision to blame Democrats’ immigration policies for the violence less than 24 hours after the attack. Whether the spirit of cooperation will continue between the New York Democrats is an open question. Republican candidate, 36-year-old state assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis, vowed to improve the mayor’s relationship with the state and federal government if elected. “We’re going to work with our partners in government to get the resources we need in our city,” she said during a press conference this week as she accepted an endorsement from the MTA’s police union. “I feel that people have just had it with Bill de Blasio.” Left:

pbs,"Nov 4, 2017 11:59 AM EST",A look at women’s advances over the years in Congress," But they couldn’t even wear pants to work until the mid-1990s. There may be more women in Congress than ever before, but Capitol Hill hasn’t come close to achieving gender parity. And recent revelations of sexual harassment of female aides and even lawmakers by their male counterparts have thrust the “boys’ club” culture of Congress into the spotlight. A timeline of hard-won victories for women in Congress, as they fought to achieve equal treatment and access: 1962: Women in Congress press for the establishment of a women’s-only lounge on the first floor of the Capitol. That year, H-235 was dedicated as a powder room and lounge for female members, and included the only women’s restroom on the premises; the men’s bathroom was situated right outside of the House floor. The reading room was re-named after Lindy Boggs in 1991, and remains the only room in the Capitol named after a woman. (20 congresswomen; 2 senators, 18 House members) 1965: Congress opens a “Ladies Health Facility” for female members. The facility was significantly smaller than the two-floor men’s gym in the Rayburn House Office Building, which also had a locker room and pool for use by male members. The women’s facility was inferior, offering antiquated wooden rowing machines and wooden bars; Rep. Pat Schroeder described the facility as “six hair dryers and a ping-pong table,” according to the Office of the House Historian. (13 congresswomen; 2 senators, 11 House members) 1969: Rep. Charlotte T. Reid, a Republican from Illinois, is credited with being the first woman to wear pants on the House floor; she showed up to work in a “black wool, bell-bottomed pantsuit” and caused a stir. In the decades that followed, female representatives were discouraged from wearing pants, but some continued to do so. (11 congresswomen; 1 senator, 10 House members) 1971: Senate allows the appointment of women in patronage positions, including pages, doorkeepers, elevator operators and police officers. (15 congresswomen; 2 senators, 13 House members) 1985: The men’s gym in the House of Representatives becomes co-ed after Rep. Barbara Boxer and two other female members of Congress protest women’s exclusion from the facility. The congresswomen re-wrote the lyrics to “Has Anybody Seen My Gal” to reflect the cause, and sang it during a meeting of Democratic whips. The following month, the three-member House gym committee integrated the facility — but didn’t add a locker room for women, forcing female members to walk through public corridors in their gym clothes. Congresswomen also had to call an attendant to first make sure the doors to the showers were closed before they would be let inside. (25 congresswomen; 2 senators, 23 House members) 1992: “Year of the Woman”: More women win elections than ever before in both the House (24 elected) and the Senate (three elected). Total: 32 Majority Leader George Mitchell requests the construction of a women’s restroom just off the Senate floor sometime around the 1992 election. It was built the following year. Senate Democrats, led by Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle (C), talk to reporters after meeting with President Clinton at the White House about the Starr grand jury report, September 10, 1998. Shown are (L-R) Sens. Max Baucus (D-Mont.), Robert Torricelli (D-N.J.), Daschle (D-S.D.), Jay Rockefeller (D-W.Va.), Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.), Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.) and John Breaux (D-La.). Photo by Reuters 1993: Sens. Barbara Mikulski, Nancy Kassebaum and Carol Moseley-Braun are credited with being the first to buck tradition by wearing pants on the Senate floor, breaking an unofficial rule that women must wear dresses or skirts. According to other reports, Senate sergeant-at-arms Martha Pope circulated a memo among door attendants updating the dress code to include “coordinated pantsuits” after Moseley-Braun showed up in slacks. (54 congresswomen; 7 senators, 47 House members) That same year, three female Congress members played in the Congressional Baseball Game for the first time. 2006: The Office of the Attending Physician opens the first dedicated lactation suite in the Russell Senate Office Building where nursing mothers can pump privately. Each room in the suite was equipped with pumps, chairs, TVs and refrigerators. The following year, Speaker Nancy Pelosi created dedicated lactation areas in House buildings. (82 congresswomen; 14 senators, 68 House members). 2011: Female members of the House of Representatives get a women’s bathroom off the House floor. Since 1962, they had been forced to use the restroom inside the women’s reading room. (90 congresswomen; 17 senators, 73 House members). 2013: Senate doubles the size of the women’s restroom in order to accommodate increasing number of female lawmakers. (100 congresswomen; 20 senators, 80 House members) 2017: More than 30 female lawmakers from both parties wore sleeveless blouses and dresses during a “Sleeveless Friday” protest of a rule barring congresswomen from showing their arms on the House floor and the adjoining Speaker’s Lobby. Speaker Paul Ryan pledged to “modernize” the dress code. (105 congresswomen; 21 senators, 84 House members) Left:

pbs,"Nov 4, 2017 11:14 AM EST","Facing tumult at home, Trump sets out on lengthy Asia trip"," The 12-day, five-country trip, the longest Far East itinerary for a president in a generation, comes at a precarious moment for Trump. Just days ago, his former campaign chairman was indicted and another adviser pleaded guilty as part of an investigation into possible collusion between his 2016 campaign and Russian officials. With Trump set to arrive Sunday in Japan, the trip presents a crucial international test for a president looking to reassure Asian allies worried that his inward-looking “America First” agenda could cede power in the region to China. They also are rattled by his bellicose rhetoric about North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The North’s growing missile arsenal threatens the capitals Trump will visit. “The trip comes, I would argue, at a very inopportune time for the president. He is under growing domestic vulnerabilities that we all know about, hour to hour,” said Jonathan Pollack, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington. “The conjunction of those issues leads to the palpable sense of unease about the potential crisis in Korea.” Trump’s spontaneous, and at time reckless, style flies in the face of the generations-old traditions and protocol that govern diplomatic exchanges in Asia. The grand receptions expected for him in Tokyo, Seoul, Beijing and beyond are sure to be lavish attempts to impress the president, who raved about the extravagances shown him on earlier visits to Saudi Arabia and France. The trip will also put Trump in face-to-face meetings with authoritarian leaders for whom he has expressed admiration. They include China’s Xi Jinping, whom Trump has likened to “a king,” and the Philippines’ Rodrigo Duterte, who has sanctioned the extrajudicial killings of drug dealers. Trump may also have the chance for a second private audience with Russian President Vladimir Putin, on the sidelines of a summit in Vietnam. The White House is signaling that Trump will push American economic interests in the region, but the North Korean threat is expected to dominate the trip. One of Trump’s two major speeches will come before the National Assembly in Seoul. Fiery threats against the North could resonate differently than they do from the distance of Washington. Trump will forgo a trip to the Demilitarized Zone, the stark border between North and South Korea. All U.S. presidents except one since Ronald Reagan have visited the DMZ in a sign of solidarity with Seoul. The White House contends that Trump’s commitment to South Korea is already crystal clear, as evidenced by his war of words with Kim and his threats to deliver “fire and fury” to North Korea if it does not stop threatening American allies. The escalation of rhetoric, a departure from the conduct of past presidents, has undermined confidence in the U.S. as a stabilizing presence in Asia. “There’s a danger if there is a lot of muscle flexing,” said Mike Chinoy, a senior fellow at the U.S.-China Institute at the University of Southern California. “Trump has been going right up to the edge and I wouldn’t rule out some sort of forceful North Korean reaction to Trump’s presence in the region,” he said. The White House said Trump would be undeterred. “The president will use whatever language he wants to use, obviously. That’s been of great reassurance to our allies, partners and others in the region who are literally under the gun of this regime,” White House national security adviser H.R. McMaster said Thursday. “I don’t think the president really modulates his language, have you noticed?” At each stop, Trump will urge his hosts to squeeze North Korea by stopping trading with the North and sending home North Korean citizens working abroad. That includes China, which competes with the U.S. for influence in the region and provides much of North Korea’s economic lifeblood. The White House is banking on the close relationships Trump has established with some Asian leaders to help make his demands more palatable. Officials acknowledge that Trump does not yet have a feel for Moon Jae-in, South Korea’s newly elected liberal president. But Trump has demonstrated cordial relations with Xi and struck up a friendship with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, with whom he planned to golf on Sunday. While Xi and Abe have recently tightened their control on power, Trump arrives weakened by low poll numbers, a stalled domestic agenda and the swirling Russia probe. Many in the Asian capitals will view Trump warily. His early withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership demolished the Obama administration’s effort to boost trade with some of the world’s fastest-growing economies and sustain America’s post-World War II strategic commitment to Asia. Trump is expected to outline his economic vision for the region, which includes a preference for one-to-one relationships over multinational agreements, during a speech at a summit in Vietnam. He is not expected to offer any concrete economic policy changes while in Asia, though some new contracts for American businesses may be announced. His administration’s eager embrace of a deeper strategic partnership with India and other democracies across the Pacific risks alienating China and Pakistan. The White House did, at the last minute, extend the trip for an extra day so Trump could attend the East Asia Summit in the Philippines. At the same time, Trump can point to some early successes in Asia. He won Beijing’s support for the toughest international sanctions yet on North Korea. Tensions in the disputed South China Sea that escalated as China conducted a massive land-reclamation effort on Obama’s watch have ebbed. Long-standing U.S. alliances with Thailand and the Philippines have been repaired by engaging their authoritarian leaders and sidelining human rights concerns, though the White House suggested Trump may chide Duterte privately. “How much does it help to yell about these problems?” McMaster said. The White House hopes the trip could offer a chance at a reset as a tumultuous first year in office winds down. Trump’s advisers see it as an opportunity for the president to forcefully assert U.S. pledges to its allies and deliver a fierce warning directly to North Korea’s Kim, whom he has belittled as “little Rocket Man.” Trump’s trip will be the longest Asia visit for any U.S. president since George H.W. Bush went there in 1992, when he fell ill during a state dinner with the Japanese prime minister. Associated Press writers Jill Colvin and Matthew Pennington in Washington contributed to this report.

pbs,N/A,Why Trump is on the minds of Virginia voters picking a governor," President Trump’s involvement in the race has been limited to four tweets, but polling suggests he is casting a very long shadow over how voters relate to the Republican candidate, Ed Gillespie, who's embraced some of Mr. Trump’s signature issues. John Yang reports on the president’s role. Judy Woodruff: There’s an election in Virginia next Tuesday, in this off-year’s only competitive governor’s race, one that analysts will be watching closely for insights about voters’ attitudes toward President Trump. We sent our own John Yang to take a look. John Yang: On a soggy fall day in Richmond, Virginia, the menu was cider, with a large serving of politics. Man: Are we going to change the course of history in this country? (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) John Yang: It was billed as a get-out-the-vote event for the Virginia election, but most of the talk was about President Trump’s turbulent first year. Former Attorney General Eric Holder — Eric Holder: If you’re there with neo-Nazis and white supremacists in Charlottesville, you have got to turn in your good person card. John Yang: Chelsea Higgs Wise, a clinical social worker, helped organize the event for Democratic candidate for governor Ralph Northam. Chelsea Higgs Wise: I really understand that everything that’s going on has to do with the Republican train and the Trump train. But this has pushed me to take all of my free time, truly, and dedicate it to the elections. John Yang: For some, Mr. Trump is irrelevant. Tanner Hirschfeld is a 19-year-old University of Virginia student who is active in Republican politics. He’s backing Ed Gillespie in the governor’s race. Tanner Hirschfeld: People are coming to me, saying, well, you can’t vote for somebody like Donald Trump. I will say, I didn’t know Donald Trump was running in the state of Virginia. That’s news to me. John Yang: But polling suggests the president is casting a very long shadow over the hotly contested off-year governor’s race in the only Southern state Mr. Trump lost. A new Washington Post-Schar School survey found that nearly six in 10 likely voters said Mr. Trump is an important factor in their vote. The same poll found the president’s approval rating among likely voters at only 38 percent. That sentiment holds true for Northam supporter Eric Anderson, a chemical engineer. Eric Anderson: Gillespie has done little or nothing to distance himself from Trump, and so I assume he would go along with whatever programs Trump wants to institute. John Yang: And for Gillespie backer Alison Katzman. How important is it that you elect a governor who gets along with President Trump? Alison Katzman: Very important. Right now, I just want Ed Gillespie to win so I don’t have John Yang: How closely do these voters associate the president and the Republican candidate? When you look at Ed Gillespie, do you see Donald Trump? Eric Anderson: When I look at him, I don’t. But when I listen to him, I do. Tanner Hirschfeld: Absolutely not. In Donald Trump, I see more of an opportunist. Ed, I think, has been a lifelong conservative. Alison Katzman: No, I see Ed Gillespie. But nobody’s Donald Trump except Donald Trump. Chelsea Higgs Wise: Charlottesville continues to ring in my ears and be the picture in my head, and that, of course, is Donald Trump. John Yang: Gillespie, a former Republican operative and lobbyist, has tried to distance himself from the president’s behavior, here at a July debate moderated by Judy Woodruff. Ed Gillespie: I don’t agree with everything the president says or tweets, and I have made that clear, but my focus is on Virginia. And we have got to get Virginia growing again. When I disagree with the president, I will make it clear. John Yang: While Vice President Mike Pence has visited Virginia to try to elect the state’s first Republican governor since 2009, the president’s involvement has been limited to four tweets. Gillespie’s campaign ads, though, embrace Mr. Trump’s issues. Illegal immigration. Narrator: Ralph Northam voted in favor of sanctuary cities that let dangerous illegal immigrants back on the street. John Yang: And Confederate monuments. Ed Gillespie: I’m for keeping them up. And he’s for taking them down. John Yang: Polls find both issues far down on the list of voters’ priorities. But they are very important to some of the Trump supporters who voted against Gillespie in the surprisingly close Republican primary. Gillespie backer Alison Katzman, a tax preparer, didn’t vote for him in the primary. At the top of her concerns, Confederate monuments. Alison Katzman: That is one issue that I feel that is very important. It’s sort of like the left at this point is tilting at windmills. We have got to get rid of this statue when that name offends somebody, and then it’s something else. John Yang: That’s a concern for Northam voter Eric Anderson. He’s a registered Republican, and voted for Gillespie in the primary. Eric Anderson: What disturbs me is, having won, Gillespie seems to be moving not towards the center, but towards the fringe. When I see the campaign ads and he says at the end, you know, he authorized this message, he’s also authorized a Trump message. John Yang: Northam seems to have recalculated his approach to the president after the physician got national attention for this diagnosis: Ralph Northam: I’m listening carefully to Donald Trump, and I think he’s a narcissistic maniac. John Yang: His tone now? Ralph Northam: And, as a doctor, nobody ever asks if I’m a Democrat or a Republican. They just want my help. So, if Donald Trump is helping Virginia, I will work with him. John Yang: While the voters we talked to are split on the president’s role in this Virginia contest, they do agree on the importance of the outcome. If you woke up, the morning after Election Day and found out that Ed Gillespie had won, is there anything you would be concerned about? Eric Anderson: I think that Gillespie would be especially bad for immigrants. I think he would be awful for women’s rights, particularly the right to choose. Chelsea Higgs Wise: I would feel like those pictures, those people in Charlottesville, they won. Those people and groups, and with the tiki torches just walking towards me and my daughter ready to take away our rights and say, you don’t matter. John Yang: You learn that Ralph Northam has won the election, what would you be worried about? Alison Katzman: I will be very unhappy that the state is going to go even further to the left. Tanner Hirschfeld: I think this race is super important for the future of Virginia politics. John Yang: One that’s drawing attention nationwide for signs about the future of both parties. For the PBS NewsHour, I’m John Yang in Alexandria, Virginia. Watch the Full Episode Nov 03 By PBS NewsHour Nov 03 By PBS NewsHour Support Provided By:

pbs,N/A,"Shields and Brooks on GOP bid for tax reform, Russia probe indictments"," Syndicated columnist Mark Shields and New York Times columnist David Brooks joins Judy Woodruff to discuss the week’s news, including the Virginia governor’s race, suggestions by Donna Brazile that the Democratic primary race was rigged for Hillary Clinton, the GOP tax overhaul plan and the Russia probe indictments. Judy Woodruff: And now to the analysis of Shields and Brooks. That’s syndicated columnist Mark Shields and New York Times columnist David Brooks. Gentlemen, thank you. Mark Shields: Judy. Judy Woodruff: So, let’s talk about Virginia, Mark. What does that race look like? Mark Shields: Well, the race on both sides, people are saying it’s a three-, four-, two-point lead. The — one Republican said to me today they are relieved that the president was out of the country, because he was afraid that, if he got word the race was that close, he would start tweeting and insert himself back into the race. But, as we saw in John’s piece, the president is very much a part of the piece. Ed Gillespie, a conventional Republican, a Republican National Committee staffer, became chair, became counselor to President George W. Bush, is running, has got the lyrics of Donald Trump’s score playbook, but he doesn’t have the music. But the latest period after John’s wonderful piece was that they’re now running on the football players kneeling at the national anthem and saying, stand up for America or Virginia. I would say this, Judy. If, in fact, the Democrats lose on Tuesday in Virginia, that it will lead to — close to civil war within the Democratic Party. Judy Woodruff: Whoa. Mark Shields: It will be — there will be reprisals between the Bernie — that Northam has run a very conventional, sort of cautious campaign, and that will be — and Bernie Sanders — Tom Perriello, the — his primary opponent on the other side, there will be questions that he had — the Democratic Party really didn’t stand — and 2016 all over again. Judy Woodruff: Close race? David Brooks: Yes, it’s getting close. This is sort of bad news for both parties. Mark Shields: Yes. David Brooks: First, Ed Gillespie, as Mark mentioned, is like the core of the center of the Republican Party. He’s been around this town a lot. We have all known him. He’s just the conventional Republican. And where the center of the Republican Party is, that’s where Ed Gillespie is at that moment. And now it’s a Trump party. And he’s running on these Trump issues, MS-13, a gang in Northern Virginia that has killed some people, and so it’s violence committed by illegal immigrants, the core Trump issue. It’s a campaign that has some economic opportunity, but a lot of it is about fear of outsiders, so that core message. So it’s a sign the Republican Party is becoming the Trump party, and that if you want the run as a Republican, you have got to run as a Trumpian, and you can do well. He was pretty far back a month ago, 10, 15 points. And now he’s three to five points behind, and so it sort of works. For the Democrats, as Mark says, this is a state, as John reported, Clinton won by five. Trump is super unpopular. And their guy, a pretty conventional, pretty good candidate, can’t pull out a big win out of this? That would be a sign for Democrats that, even when Trump is super unpopular, they can’t get big turnout, and they can’t get big turnout among African-Americans, which is why Eric Holder and people like that are there. They can’t get big turnout from people who aren’t hard-core voters, and that the Democratic base is not super mobilized to vote. And that would just be a gigantic warning sign for 2018. Judy Woodruff: A warning sign for 2018. At the same time, Mark, in the last couple of days, we have been hearing another sign of a big fissure, divide inside the Democratic Party, this book by Donna Brazile, a prominent figure in the Democratic Party, former chair of the party, wrote, in effect, that because there was this financial deal with the Clinton campaign, which was supporting the Democratic Party hurting for money, that the primary election last year was rigged in Clinton’s favor. Mark Shields: She did. And it’s a serious charge made by a serious person, Donna Brazile. Could not come at a worse time for the Democrats, on the eve of the Virginia, just as David is talking about, generating interest, enthusiasm and turnout, this is anything — will do anything but. But I will say this, Judy. It has the ring of authenticity about it. Donna Brazile was exposed herself for having given questions before a debate when she was at CNN to Hillary Clinton. She’s a person of enormous talent. I think, if anything, this is sort of cri de coeur, a statement of what she believes, and to come clean. But I will say this, that it’s proof, more than anything else, to me of how little Barack Obama cared about the Democratic Party or about politics. He was great at getting elected. He got a national majority twice in a row. Nobody had done that since Eisenhower. He was leaving the party $24 million in debt, therefore, vulnerable to Hillary Clinton’s coterie of big givers. Bernie Sanders didn’t have big givers, as we know. Judy Woodruff: And President Trump now, David, is saying the Democratic Party should be investigated, the Clinton campaign should be investigated by the Justice Department, the FBI. David Brooks: Yes, I don’t know about that. But those of us who are trying to rebut populists like Trump have the disadvantage that our elites really do stink. And this is an advantage — example of that. It was sort of an open secret that the DNC was on Hillary Clinton’s side. We saw it from the schedule of the debates all through the year. They didn’t want to have them, because they didn’t want to give Sanders the platform. But this goes beyond what even I imagined was the level of collusion. It’s a pretty sleazy economic takeover of a party apparatus, against the bylaws of that apparatus. It’s just not something a normal campaign that respects institutions and how things should work should do. And so they colluded, apparently, according to Donna Brazile, in a pretty major way. And if you were a Sanders person, you have every right to be completely upset. Mark Shields: Just make one quick point. And that is, the reason I say President Obama, any time you have a national party and the White House, the same party, the White House controls that national party. The national party was a totally — extension… Judy Woodruff: That’s typical. Mark Shields: Typical. I mean, Donald Trump controls the Republican National Committee today. That’s always the case. And President Obama just didn’t like politics. He didn’t like the company of politicians. The Democrats lost 979 state legislative seats, 63 House seats, 12 Senate seats. In 19 states, they lost control of both houses of legislature and the governorship during his time. He didn’t go out and recruit. He was great himself, but not much for — he didn’t like the business. He didn’t like the company of politicians. Judy Woodruff: A different kind of economics, David, and that is taxes. The Republicans did come out this week, yesterday, with their tax reform, tax cut proposal. What does it say to you about what the Republicans in Congress and the president want right now? David Brooks: Well, they have a vision for what business taxes should be, which is to lower the rates. And I think there’s a — our corporate rates are super high. And to attract capital to this country, it would help to lower the rates. They have no vision of what individual tax rates should be or how we should tax individuals. Their bill is sort of a hodgepodge of moving rates the rates around randomly. They have no vision of how to protect families. There could have been a much bigger child tax credit. And then, finally — and this is what everyone — the point everyone is making, but it happens to be true — they have no vision about the fiscal health of this country in the long term. I personally think there are some pieces of this legislation that I like, capping the mortgage interest deduction. There are some things I don’t like. I don’t think cutting the rates the way that they do is super important. But it’s all dwarfed by the $1.5 trillion hole they’re going to blow in the deficit. And until they can solve that problem, you’re not really dealing seriously for this country. (CROSSTALK) Mark Shields: I agree completely about the $1.5 trillion deficit, Judy. And it is going to be financed, as we know, from the Republican votes in the House and the Senate, by cuts in Medicare and Medicaid, the very constituency that Donald Trump pledged to be the champion of. And, no, it’s — I would say it had its biggest day yesterday. I really do. I mean, I think it’s not something that stands the daylight very well or scrutiny. It starts with 25 percent approval support in the country. That’s the lowest that any presidential initiative since George W. Bush’s ill-fated attempt to privatize Social Security in 2005, which died after 10 months. Judy, what these people forget is the 1986 Tax Reform Act began in 1982 with Bill Bradley and Dick Gephardt and Bradley-Gephardt. And it includes people of the talent of Jim Baker and Dick Darman at the White House. Steve Mnuchin and Gary Cohn are not Dick Darman and Jim Baker. And it had 430 witnesses before the House Ways and Means Committee and 26 days of markups. These people think they’re going to do it on the fly, on the run? They’re absolutely delusional. Judy Woodruff: So, both of you are saying… (CROSSTALK) David Brooks: Dan Rostenkowski. There was a lot of serious talent. Mark Shields: Dan Rostenkowski, Bob Packwood. David Brooks: But what’s — it’s not going to pass. Like, they punish people in the blue states. You’re going to get rid of state and local deduction, and that that is going to create massive opposition. The realtors, philanthropies, student debt, there’s all sorts of things that are politically mine fields. The question to me is, does it completely die or do they fall back to some limited tax cut, just so they can say they passed something? Judy Woodruff: They passed something. David Brooks: And I would bet — I don’t know if I would bet, but I suspect they will try to fall back to something plausible, maybe just the corporate rates. I don’t know what else. But they will try to fall back to just simple, smaller tax cut. Judy Woodruff: Mark, I want to turn us quickly here at the end to Robert Mueller’s investigation, Russia investigation. They turned out some indictments this week, and not entirely surprising, Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign managers, his associate, Rick Gates, and then an interesting plea deal with a younger, almost unknown person on the Trump campaign. Was this a significant move coming from the special counsel, or what? How do you see this? Mark Shields: I think it’s significant, Judy. This was a man that was the subject of extreme vetting, Paul Manafort, that Donald Trump applies to everybody. He was only going to get the best, and he chose him to be the chairman of his presidential campaign. So, I mean, that gives you the idea of the extreme vetting that went on. And I think they are grave and serious charges. But the key to this whole indictment to me was the Papadopoulos indictment. Nobody in Washington, and rumored — maybe David has better rumors than I do — nobody ever had mentioned this arrest or this plea. It came as a big surprise. And now, you can imagine the nervousness inside. For the past two-and-a-half months, this is somebody who’s already pleaded and may very well have been in conversation. So, I think it’s a — you can see it from the president. He keeps talking about witch-hunts, they are going to get rid of Jeff Sessions. There is a nervousness and an anxiety that’s endemic. Judy Woodruff: How do you read it? David Brooks: Yes, everyone, when the indictments came down, went to DEFCON 9 around here. I went to DEFCON 2 or 3. Like, Manafort being a kind of sleazy operator, that is not exactly headline news here. The Papadopoulos thing is the open door. And what’s on the other side of that door, we don’t know. So, maybe it leads to something. Maybe it doesn’t lead to something. He wasn’t a major player. To me, the question I always ask, what did Donald Trump do? Is there something that this is pointing to Donald Trump did something himself? That is an administration-changing event. But we haven’t gotten anywhere near that so far. Judy Woodruff: We don’t know the answer to that question. David Brooks: No. Judy Woodruff: David Brooks, Mark Shields. Mark Shields: What did the president not know, and when did he not know it? Judy Woodruff: When did he not know it? Thank you both. Mark Shields: Thank you. Watch the Full Episode Nov 03 By PBS NewsHour Nov 03 By PBS NewsHour Support Provided By:

pbs,"Nov 3, 2017 6:17 PM EST",EPA chief Pruitt scheduled to meet privately with chemical industry executives," Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt is listed as the featured speaker at a board meeting of the American Chemistry Council, a group that has lobbied against stricter regulations for chemical manufacturers. The three-day conference is being held at The Sanctuary resort on Kiawah Island, South Carolina. Council spokeswoman Anne Kolton said Pruitt’s speech will not be open to the public or the news media. Admission to the members-only event where Pruitt is speaking ranges between $7,500 and $2,500, depending on sponsorship level. Rooms at the resort are being offered to conference attendees at a discounted rate of $389 a night, not including taxes and fees. Travel and lodging expenses for Pruitt, four aides and his security team will be borne by taxpayers. EPA spokesman Jahan Wilcox declined to provide an estimate of the total cost for the trip, but said the government employees would be staying for the federally mandated room rate of $135 a night. Registration fees for Pruitt and his staff were waived since the EPA administrator is an invited speaker. The government employees will not be participating in the golf events scheduled as part of the conference, Wilcox said. Corporate members of the American Chemistry Council include such industry giants Dow Chemical, DuPont, ExxonMobil, Chevron and Arkema. A Republican lawyer who previously served as the attorney general of Oklahoma, Pruitt railed against federal environmental regulations he considers too restrictive on the petrochemical industry. Following his appointment to lead EPA, Pruitt has repeatedly intervened to reverse or delay implementation of regulations opposed by chemical and pesticide makers. Pruitt overruled the recommendation of his agency’s own scientists to ban the Dow pesticide chlorpyrifos after federal scientists concluded it can interfere with the brain development of fetuses and infants. Pruitt also delayed by until at least 2019 Obama-era rules that would have tightened safety requirements for companies storing large quantities of dangerous chemicals after the industry opposed the regulations. Pruitt has also named chemical industry insiders to key posts within EPA overseeing chemical and pesticide safety. EPA’s top public affairs official, Liz Bowman, worked until March as the director of issue and advocacy communications for the American Chemistry Council. Though past EPA administrators have met privately with industry representatives, Pruitt has crisscrossed the country to meet with top executives of industries his agency regulates. Unlike past EPA leaders, Pruitt’s speaking engagements are typically disclosed only after the fact and are rarely open to the public. Wilcox said Pruitt’s travel schedule is not disclosed ahead of time due to security concerns. His speaking engagement at the Chemistry Council event was revealed in an online agenda posted by the group and first reported by The Washington Post. EPA’s inspector general is reviewing Pruitt’s frequent taxpayer-funded trips, which often include weekend layovers at his home in Oklahoma, to determine whether they adhere to federal travel polices.

pbs,"Nov 3, 2017 4:32 PM EST",House panel schedules hearing on sexual harassment," The panel’s chairman, Republican Rep. Gregg Harper of Mississippi, says he wants to ensure the House provides needed training about sexual harassment and remind lawmakers and staff of policies that support a person’s right to report any incident of harassment. Announcement of the Nov. 14 hearing comes after House Speaker Paul Ryan encouraged members of Congress to complete sexual harassment training and require such training for their staffs. The news comes after one current and three former female members of Congress told The Associated Press they have been sexually harassed or subjected to hostile sexual comments by their male colleagues while serving in the House. The revelations come amid an intensifying national focus on sexual harassment and gender hostility in the workplace, and underscore that no woman is immune, even at the highest reaches of government. The incidents occurred years or even decades ago, usually when the women were young newcomers to Congress. They range from isolated comments at one hearing, to repeated unwanted come-ons, to lewd remarks and even groping on the House floor. Speaking on the record were current Rep. Linda Sanchez of California and former Sen. Barbara Boxer, former Rep. Mary Bono and former Rep. Hilda Solis. House Speaker Paul Ryan is encouraging members of Congress to complete sexual harassment training and require such training for their staffs. Ryan calls reports of sexual harassment by public figures “deeply disturbing” and said Congress “can and should lead by example” to combat harassment. The Wisconsin Republican says lawmakers have approached him in recent days to express concerns about House policies against harassment. The Associated Press reported Friday that female lawmakers say they have been harassed or subjected to hostile sexual comments by fellow members of Congress. In a letter Friday to all House members, Ryan said he wants to be “absolutely clear that any form of harassment has no place” in Congress, adding that lawmakers have a responsibility to ensure the Capitol is “free from discrimination, harassment and retaliation.” Left:

pbs,"Nov 3, 2017 3:36 PM EST","Manafort, Gates trial tentatively set for May as Russia probe continues"," U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson says in a court filing Friday that the trial of Paul Manafort, the former campaign chairman for President Donald Trump, and his business associate Rick Gates will start on May 7. That date is subject to change. Manafort and Gates were charged Monday in a 12-count indictment alleging violations of money laundering, banking and foreign lobbying laws. They’ve both pleaded not guilty and are free on bail but under house arrest.Their lawyers have sought to ease the conditions of their pre-trial confinement. Court documents show Manafort plans to challenge the evidence obtained by special counsel Robert Mueller. An attorney for Manafort said in papers filed Friday that he expects to file pretrial motions to suppress what Mueller “improperly obtained by search warrant, subpoena or otherwise.” Manafort’s Virginia home was raided in July by FBI agents. Lawyer Kevin Downing says in a filing that he also plans to file motions challenging the legal basis of the charges. Court documents show Mueller thinks it will take three weeks to present a case against the ex-Trump campaign officials. Meanwhile, three Republican House members are introducing a resolution that calls for Mueller to “resign from his special counsel position immediately.” Mueller was appointed special counsel in May to lead the Justice Department’s investigation into Russian election interference and whether President Donald Trump’s campaign was involved. Since then, some Republicans have pushed back on the investigation. Reps. Matt Gaetz of Florida, Andy Biggs of Arizona and Louis Gohmert of Texas introduced the resolution, which would be nonbinding if passed. Republican leaders have shown little appetite for publicly pressuring Mueller. The lawmakers say Mueller should step down because he was FBI director when a Russian-backed company purchased American uranium mines in 2010. They say he mishandled the case, which Trump has called the “real Russia story.” Left:

pbs,"Nov 3, 2017 3:06 PM EST",What to watch for during Trump’s swing through Asia,"  Trump meets with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Sunday, followed by stops in South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines. He will attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, or APEC, forum in Vietnam on Nov. 10 and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, summit in the Philippines on Nov. 13. Trump does not plan to attend the East Asia Summit in the Philippines on Nov. 14, though a U.S. delegation will go. He also is not expected to visit the Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea as other U.S. officials have done this year. Focus on North Korea The trip comes as Trump is considering putting North Korea back on the list of countries that sponsor terrorism, said national security adviser H.R. McMaster on Thursday at a White House briefing. “It’s time for a really concerted effort to do everything we can, short of military action,” he said. Past approaches of negotiating with North Korea have not worked, said McMaster. The United States will respond with “all of its capabilities” to North Korea’s aggression, he said. The Asian nations likely will seek clarity on which conditions will prompt U.S. military action, said Frank Aum, senior expert on North Korea at the U.S. Institute of Peace. “There’s a lot of unease in the region based on North Korea’s accelerated missile demonstrations and the sharp rhetoric between Washington and Pyongyang.” North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Premier Pak Pong Ju arrive for the opening ceremony of the Cemetery of Fallen Fighters of the Korean People’s Army in Pyongyang July 25, 2013. Photo by Jason Lee/Reuters So far, U.S. officials have said they would endorse military action in defense of the homeland or its allies, Aum said, but what about pre-emptively, such as if North Korea places an intercontinental ballistic missile on a mobile launcher or if the U.S. feels that diplomacy has run its course? The White House, for its part, will be looking for an articulation of broad international support for increasing pressure on North Korea, especially from China, to demonstrate that it’s not only a U.S. responsibility, Aum said. Trump plans to build on his relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping to get China to do more enforcement of sanctions, said McMaster. “China has a great deal of economic power,” and on this matter, the U.S. and China’s interests are aligned, he said. “China recognizes it is clearly in China’s interest and all nations’ interest to de-nuclearize the (Korean) peninsula.” Sheila Smith, senior fellow for Japan studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, said she expects Japan’s Abe and Trump to reiterate their strong cooperation on North Korea. Eyes also will be on whether the U.S. withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership will come up, or China’s building of islands in the South China Sea, she said. Abe has continued to advocate for the TPP trade deal, and he has reached out to the European Union about reducing or eliminating tariffs, in light of the U.S. action, she said. Will Trump address human rights? Along with other leaders in Asia, Trump will meet with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who has dismissed concerns over human rights in his ongoing war on drugs. File photo of Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte by Dondi Tawatao/Reuters When asked by reporters if Trump would bring up human rights violations on this visit, McMaster said that Trump has proven to take a “very strong” stance on human rights, as he did for Syria and Venezuela. “He does it quietly. What does it help to yell about these problems? The president has done quite a bit and will continue to do more.” Will Trump meet with Putin at the summits? That has not yet been determined, said McMaster. Trump’s associates are under investigation for possibly coordinating with Russia on efforts to sway the 2016 election. “There was no collusion,” Trump said on Friday before leaving on his trip. Of the Russia investigation, he said, “It’s a disgrace. You ought to look at Hillary Clinton. … A lot of people are disappointed in the Justice Department, including me.” Will Trump tone down his tweets? When asked if Trump will be less inflammatory on Twitter during the trip, McMaster said, “What’s inflammatory is the North Korean regime and what they’re doing to threaten the world.” Left:

pbs,"Nov 3, 2017 2:57 PM EST",Trump: U.S. military is hitting ISIS ‘much harder’ after New York attack," It was not immediately clear whether the Somalia strikes were carried out as presidentially directed retaliation for the truck attack that killed eight people. The alleged New York attacker, Sayfullo Saipov, told FBI interrogators that he was inspired by IS, and Trump wrote in a tweet that the group claimed Saipov as “their soldier.” …Based on that, the Military has hit ISIS ""much harder"" over the last two days. They will pay a big price for every attack on us! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 3, 2017  Trump tweeted: “Based on that, the Military has hit ISIS ‘much harder’ over the last two days. They will pay a big price for every attack on us!” Asked about this later, Trump told reporters before he departed on his Asia trip, “”What we’re doing is every time we’re attacked from this point forward — and it took place yesterday — we are hitting them 10 times harder. So when we have an animal do an attack like he did the other day on the west side of Manhattan we are hitting them 10 times harder.”  The Somalia attack involved two airstrikes overnight, according to a U.S. official who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and so spoke on condition of anonymity. It was the first time the U.S. military has done airstrikes against IS-affiliated fighters in Somalia, where the group is a growing presence. The military’s daily rundown Friday of U.S. and coalition airstrikes against Islamic State targets in Iraq and Syria reported nine strikes in Syria on Thursday and four in Iraq. That is consistent with strike levels throughout this week. Asked about Trump’s assertion that the military is striking IS “10 times harder,” the Pentagon issued a brief statement saying the U.S. continues to strike IS, along with al-Qaida and other like-minded extremist groups, “wherever they are globally and at a time of our choosing.” Associated Press National Security Writer Robert Burns contributed to this report.

                                    — Updated on Nov 3, 2017 4:37 PM EST","Global warming is stronger than ever — and nearly all of it is man-made, new government report says"," The report released Friday is one of two scientific assessments required every four years. A draft showing how warming affects the U.S. was also published. Despite fears by some scientists and environmental advocates, David Fahey of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and several authors said there was no political interference or censoring of the 477-page final report. It’s the most comprehensive summary of climate science since 2013, showing a warming worsening world. “A lot of what we’ve been learning over the last four year suggests the possibility that things may have been more serious than we think,” said Robert Kopp of Rutgers University, one of the dozens of scientists inside and outside the government who wrote the studies. Since 1900, Earth has warmed by 1.8 degrees (1 degree Celsius) and seas have risen by 8 inches. Heat waves, downpours and wildfires have become frequent. Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt have repeatedly said carbon dioxide isn’t the primary contributor to global warming. It’s “extremely likely” — meaning with 95 to 100 percent certainty — that global warming is man-made, mostly from the spewing of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, scientists concluded. “Over the last century, there are no convincing alternative explanations,” the report said. Scientists calculated that human contribution to warming since 1950 is between 92 percent and 123 percent. It’s more than 100 percent on one end, because some natural forces — such as volcanoes and orbital cycle — are working to cool Earth, but are being overwhelmed by the effects of greenhouse gases, said study co-author Katharine Hayhoe of Texas Tech. “This period is now the warmest in the history of modern civilization,” she said. For the first time, scientists highlighted a dozen “tipping points” of potential dangers that could happen from warming, things that Hayhoe said “keep me up at night.” They include the slowing down of the giant Atlantic Ocean circulation system that could dramatically warp weather worldwide, much stronger El Ninos, major decreases in ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, which would spike sea level rise, and massive release of methane and carbon dioxide from thawing permafrost that could turbo-charge warming. Researchers did not provide an estimate of how likely tipping points would occur, but “there is certainly some chance of some of these things happening,” Fahey said. The report also documented how different climate change-caused events can interact in a complex way to make life worse such as the California wildfires and Superstorm Sandy five years ago. “It shows that if anything the findings of scientists have become more dire” since 2013, said University of California Berkeley climate scientist Zeke Hausfather, who wasn’t part of the work.

                                    — Updated on Nov 3, 2017 3:46 PM EST","Trump says he’s ‘disappointed’ with Justice Department, won’t rule out firing Sessions"," “Honestly, they should be looking at the Democrats,” Trump told reporters before departing the White House on a 12-day trip to Asia. The president’s comments came after he tweeted several times Friday morning to criticize his former 2016 rival Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee: “Crooked Hillary bought the DNC &amp; then stole the Democratic Primary from Crazy Bernie!,” he wrote, adding it’s the “real story on Collusion.” Asked if he would fire Sessions if DOJ doesn’t focus its investigative powers on Democrats, Trump said, “I don’t know.” Trump continued: “A lot of people are disappointed in the Justice Department, including me.” Special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 election. This week, former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his business associate Rick Gates, who also had a role in the campaign, were indicted on 12 counts, and former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying about his dealings with Russians who were offering “dirt” on Hillary Clinton. The White House has repeatedly sought to turn the attention of the probe, which is looking into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government, to Clinton and her campaign. Earlier Friday, Trump said the American public “deserves” a federal investigation of Clinton and the DNC over a joint fundraising agreement they signed in August 2015.  Trump’s accusations follow publication by Politico of an excerpt from former acting DNC Chair Donna Brazile’s upcoming book. Brazile alleges she found “proof” that the 2016 Democratic primary was rigged in Clinton’s favor. Brazile writes that she believes no laws were violated, but that a fundraising agreement “looked unethical.” The president tweeted, over a three-and-a-half hour span Friday: Late Thursday, Trump tweeted without evidence that he believed Democrats had acted “illegally.” The fundraising agreement Brazile wrote about, which was signed in August 2015 during the primary process, was unusual in a presidential race with no incumbent, according to Brazile, giving the Clinton campaign oversight of some DNC decisions. Months later, Clinton’s chief challenger, independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, signed his own agreement with the party. READ MORE: Sen. Elizabeth Warren says 2016 Democratic primary was rigged Left:

                                    — Updated on Nov 3, 2017 10:32 AM EST",Female lawmakers allege harassment by House colleagues," WASHINGTON — For years, Republican Rep. Mary Bono endured the increasingly suggestive comments from a fellow lawmaker in the House. But when the congressman approached her on the House floor and told her he’d been thinking about her in the shower, she’d had enough. She confronted the man, who she said still serves in Congress, telling him his comments were demeaning and wrong. And he backed off. Bono, who served 15 years before being defeated in 2012, is not alone. As reports flow almost daily of harassment or worse by men in entertainment, business and the media, one current and three former female lawmakers tell The Associated Press that they, too, have been harassed or subjected to hostile sexual comments — by fellow members of Congress. The incidents occurred years or even decades ago, usually when the women were young newcomers to Congress. They range from isolated comments at one hearing, to repeated unwanted come-ons, to lewd remarks and even groping on the House floor. Coming amid an intensifying national focus on sexual harassment and gender hostility in the workplace, the revelations underscore that no woman is immune, even at the highest reaches of government. “This is about power,” said former California Sen. Barbara Boxer, after describing an incident at a hearing in the 1980s where a male colleague made a sexually suggestive comment. The colleague, using the traditional congressional parlance, said he wanted to “associate” himself with her remarks — adding afterward that he also wanted to “associate with the gentle lady.” Boxer said the comment was met with general laughter and an approving second from the committee chairman. She said she later asked that it be removed from the record. “That was an example of the way I think we were thought of, a lot of us. … It’s hostile and embarrasses, and therefore could take away a person’s power,” she said. READ MORE: Starmaker Harvey Weinstein eclipsed by sexual harassment revelations Boxer and the other female lawmakers spoke on the record to tell their stories in the wake of revelations about Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein’s serial attacks on women, as well as disclosures from current and former Capitol Hill staffers about harassment by lawmakers and aides. Those accounts, published in The Washington Post and elsewhere, revealed that Congress has few training or reporting requirements in place to deal with sexual harassment. Largely untold before now is that some female lawmakers themselves say they have been harassed by male colleagues. While rare, the accounts raise troubling questions about the boys’ club environment in Congress where male lawmakers can feel empowered to target not only staffers but even their own peers. The lawmakers declined to identify the perpetrators by name, but at least two of the men continue to serve in the House. None of the female lawmakers interviewed reported what happened, and some noted it was not clear where they would lodge such a complaint. At least three of the four told friends or aides about the incidents, which in some cases were witnessed by other lawmakers. READ MORE: As survivors say #MeToo, what will it take to stop widespread sexual harassment? “When I was a very new member of Congress in my early 30s, there was a more senior member who outright propositioned me, who was married, and despite trying to laugh it off and brush it aside it, would repeat. And I would avoid that member,” said Rep. Linda Sanchez, D-Calif. She added that she would warn other new female members about the lawmaker in question, but she declined to identify him, while saying he remains in Congress. “I just don’t think it would be helpful” to call the lawmaker out by name, Sanchez said. “The problem is, as a member there’s no HR department you can go to, there’s nobody you can turn to. Ultimately they’re employed by their constituents.” Sanchez also said that a different male colleague repeatedly ogled her, and at one point touched her inappropriately on the House floor, while trying to make it appear accidental. She declined to identify the lawmaker but said he was no longer in Congress. Bono said she ultimately confronted her colleague on the House floor after he’d made repeated harassing comments. Bono, who arrived in the House at age 36 to replace her husband Sonny Bono after he died in a skiing accident, said it seemed like the lawmaker didn’t know how to talk to a woman as an equal. “Instead of being ‘how’s the weather, how’s your career, how’s your bill,’ it was ‘I thought about you while I was in the shower.’ So it was a matter of saying to him ‘That’s not cool, that’s just not cool.'” Bono declined to identify the lawmaker, saying the behavior stopped after she finally challenged him. He still serves in Congress, she said. “It is a man’s world, it’s still a man’s world,” Bono said. “Not being a flirt and not being a bitch. That was my rule, to try to walk that fine line.” READ MORE: Nearly 3 decades later, Anita Hill sees the needle moving on sexual harassment Former Rep. Hilda Solis, now a Los Angeles County supervisor, recalls repeated unwanted harassing overtures from one lawmaker, though she declined to name him or go into detail. “I don’t think I’m the only one. What I tried to do was ignore it, turn away, walk away. Obviously it’s offensive. Are you supposed to be flattered? No, we’re adults. Not appropriate,” said Solis, who left Congress in 2009 to join the Obama administration as labor secretary. “It’s humiliating, even though they may have thought they were being cute. No, it’s not. It’s not appropriate. I’m your colleague, but he doesn’t see me that way, and that’s a problem,” Solis said. The experiences occurred against the backdrop of broader gender inequities in Congress, where women remain a distinct minority, making up only about 20 percent of members in the House and Senate. That’s up from fewer than 10 percent in the quarter-century since politics’ Year of the Woman in 1992. That election season, large numbers of women sought office following hearings by the then-all-male Senate Judiciary Committee over Anita Hill’s testimony about alleged sexual harassment by Clarence Thomas, who was subsequently confirmed to the Supreme Court, albeit by a narrow margin. The increase in numbers and the prominence of a few individual women, such as House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, has not resulted in parity in all measures, nor eliminated the potential for male members to demean or even harass their female counterparts. Nonetheless, a few former female lawmakers contacted by The AP expressed surprise and even disbelief at the notion that lawmakers themselves could be victims of harassment. READ MORE: Tom Hanks on Hollywood’s tipping point over sexual misconduct Rep. Jackie Speier of California has recently gone public with an account of being sexually assaulted by a male chief of staff while she was a congressional staffer. She has criticized the vague rules in place on the issue and is preparing legislation to mandate sexual harassment training for congressional offices, among other changes. In a video posted to Twitter last week, she called Congress “a breeding ground for a hostile work environment” and encouraged others to come forward. Yet when it comes to lawmakers themselves, Speier said: “I think the women in Congress are big girls. The equalizer that exists in Congress that doesn’t exist in other settings is that we all get paid the same amount and we all have a vote, the same vote. So if you have members that are demeaning you it’s because you’re letting them.” Former Rep. Ellen Tauscher of California flatly argued that harassment can’t take place between members of Congress. “Female members and male members are equals, they don’t sexually harass each other,” Tauscher said. In fact, the law specifies that harassment can occur between equals, said Jennifer Drobac, a professor at the Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law, who teaches a course in sexual harassment law. “Formally, two members of Congress may have the same status. That doesn’t change the fact that sexual harassment can occur between peers,” Drobac said, noting that numerous other factors can come into play, including the difference in age and length of service between the members, and the mere fact that men have more power in society than women. Indeed the harassment or hostile incidents experienced by current and former lawmakers occurred when they were young newcomers to Congress, with less seniority than the men who targeted them. Yet the fact that some dispute whether harassment could even occur between members of Congress underscores the complexity of the issue and the fraught questions surrounding it. Bono said she found power in confronting her harasser, and that after she did so it never happened again. She emphasized that she understood her experience was different than those of young staffers who may face harassment from someone they rely on for a job, and that she was fortunate because as an equal elected by her constituents, she would not fear retaliation. But Bono strongly disputed any suggestion that she or any other female lawmaker could not be harassed by their peers. “My career didn’t suffer, I didn’t suffer,” Bono said. “But it did happen.” Left:

pbs,"Nov 3, 2017 8:34 AM EST",GOP tax bill would be broadest tax code rewrite in 30 years," The measure, which would be the most extensive rewrite of the nation’s tax code in three decades, is the product of a party that faces increasing pressure to produce a marquee legislative victory of some sort before next year’s elections. GOP leaders praised the plan as a sparkplug for the economy and a boon to the middle class and christened it the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. “We are working to give the American people a giant tax cut for Christmas,” President Donald Trump said Thursday in the Oval Office. The measure, he said, “will also be tax reform, and it will create jobs.” It would also increase the national debt, a problem for some Republicans. And Democrats attacked the proposal as the GOP’s latest bonanza for the rich, with a phase-out of the inheritance tax and repeal of the alternative minimum tax on the highest earners — certain to help Trump and members of his family and Cabinet, among others. READ MORE: Tax reform’s big changes set up GOP for big political fights “If you’re the wealthiest 1 percent, Republicans will give you the sun, the moon and the stars, all of that at the expense of the great middle class,” said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. And there was enough discontent among Republicans and business groups to leave the legislation’s fate uncertain in a journey through Congress that leaders hope will deposit a landmark bill on Trump’s desk by year’s end. Underscoring problems ahead, some Republicans from high-tax Northeastern states expressed opposition to the measure’s elimination of the deduction for state and local income taxes. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch of Utah called the House measure “a great starting point” but said it would be “somewhat miraculous” if its corporate tax rate reduction to 20 percent — a major Trump goal — survived. His panel plans to produce its own tax package in the coming days. The House Republicans’ plan, which took them months to craft in countless closed-door meetings, represents the first step in their effort to reverse what’s been a politically disastrous year in Congress. Their drive to obliterate President Barack Obama’s health care law crashed, and GOP lawmakers concede that if the tax measure collapses, their congressional majorities are at risk in next November’s elections. The package’s tax reductions would outweigh its loophole closers by a massive $1.5 trillion over the coming decade. Many Republicans were willing to add that to the nation’s soaring debt as a price for claiming a resounding tax victory. But it was likely to pose a problem for others — one of several brushfires leaders will need to extinguish to get the measure through Congress. Republicans must keep their plan’s shortfall from spilling over that $1.5 trillion line or the measure will lose its protection against Democratic Senate filibusters, bill-killing delays that take 60 votes to overcome. There are just 52 GOP senators, and unanimous Democratic opposition is likely. READ MORE: Here’s what the GOP tax reform plan would mean for families, businesses The bill would telescope today’s seven personal income tax brackets into just four: 12 percent, 25 percent, 35 percent and 39.6 percent. —The 25 percent rate would start at $45,000 for individuals and $90,000 for married couples. —The 35 percent rate would apply to family income exceeding $260,000 and individual income over $200,000, which means many upper-income families whose top rate is currently 33 percent would face higher taxes. —The top rate threshold, now $418,400 for individuals and $470,700 for couples, would rise to $500,000 and $1 million. The standard deduction — used by people who don’t itemize, around two-thirds of taxpayers — would nearly double to $12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for couples. That’s expected to encourage even more people to use the standard deduction with a simplified tax form Republicans say will be postcard-sized. Many middle-income families would pay less, thanks to the bigger standard deduction and an increased child tax credit. Republicans said their plan would save $1,182 in taxes for a family of four earning $59,000, but features like phase-outs of some benefits suggest their taxes could grow in the future. “The plan clearly chooses corporate CEOs and hedge fund managers over teachers and police officers,” said Rep. Bill Pascrell, D-N.J. One trade-off for the plan’s reductions was its elimination of breaks that millions have long treasured. Gone would be deductions for people’s medical expenses — especially important for families facing nursing home bills or lacking insurance — and their ability to write off state and local income taxes. The mortgage interest deduction would be limited to the first $500,000 of the loan, down from the current $1 million ceiling. Led by Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, the authors retained the deductibility of up to $10,000 in local property taxes in a bid to line up votes from Republicans from the Northeast. The panel planned to begin votes on the proposal next Monday. “It’s progress, but I want more,” said Rep. Leonard Lance, R-N.J., who represents one of his state’s wealthier, higher-cost districts and wants the entire property tax deduction restored. On the business side, the House would drop the top rate for corporations from 35 percent to 20 percent. American companies operating abroad would pay a 10 percent tax on their overseas subsidiaries’ profits. Cash that those firms have amassed abroad but now return home would face a one-time 12 percent tax. ___ AP writers Andrew Taylor, Zeke Miller and Kevin Freking in Washington and Mike Catalini in Trenton, New Jersey, contributed.

pbs,N/A,Tax reform’s big changes set up GOP for big political fights," House Republicans released the most sweeping proposal to overhaul the tax code in more than three decades. But however much Republicans want tax cuts, concerns about the deficit and other aspects of the bill mean that passage is not yet certain. Lisa Desjardins takes a detailed look at the bill’s proposed changes and what they mean for different Americans. Judy Woodruff: Republicans in the House of Representatives released their plan for overhauling the U.S. tax code today, the most sweeping proposal of its kind in more than three decades. It was embraced quickly by President Trump and lawmakers say they aim to pass it before the end of the year. But the bill would bring about big changes, many of which will be the subject of big political fights. Lisa Desjardins reports from Capitol Hill. Rep. Paul Ryan: Good morning! Lisa Desjardins: The speaker of the House — Rep. Paul Ryan: Good morning! Lisa Desjardins: — serving as cheerleader in chief. Paul Ryan and House Republicans unveiled a sweeping plan to affect nearly every American’s taxes and simplify them, they say, down to a postcard-sized form. Rep. Paul Ryan: With this plan we are making pro-growth reforms so that yes, America can compete with the rest of the world. But we are also making it so that families like these that are here can have more take home pay. Lisa Desjardins: The 400-page bill is dense. It would reduce most individual income tax rates, and permanently cut the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent. The alternative minimum tax for wealthier Americans would end, but so would a slew of tax breaks, including a deduction for most state and local taxes. That could hit the wallets of high-tax states and cities, like New York and New Jersey. To help offset that blow, the GOP bill would still allow deduction of property taxes. Democrat and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi slammed the proposal. Rep. Nancy Pelosi: Republicans have unveiled a bill that raises taxes on millions of middle class families and borrows trillions from the future just to give massive new tax breaks to the wealthy and especially to their friends, corporate America. Rep. Paul Ryan: So, what does the bill mean for individuals? Republicans would double the standard deduction for each taxpayer to $12,000. Next, the House GOP would collapse the seven current tax rates to just four tax rates from 12 percent to nearly 40 percent. So, who would pay what? Looking at married couples, filing jointly. Those earning under $24,000 would pay no taxes due to the new standard deduction. The largest two groups would be couples making up to $90,000, who would face a 12 percent rate, and those making between $90,000 and $260,000, they would be taxed at 25 percent. The GOP plan would keep the highest rate in the tax code, 39.6 percent, but apply that to fewer people. So, what’s this mean? It would be a rate decrease for everyone earning up to a million dollars. And for millionaires, no change. President Trump, meeting with Republicans after lunch, was enthusiastic, saying the bill could get to him by Christmas. President Donald Trump: We have a great team and it’s a team that loves what they are doing, they love the American people, they love this country and they are going to get it done. Lisa Desjardins: But some other Republicans, like Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, were uncomfortable, especially with how the tax cuts would add to the deficit. Sen. Jeff Flake: Rate reductions have to be accompanied by real reform. We cannot simply rely on rosy economic assumptions, rosy growth rates to fill in the gap. We’ve got to make tough decisions. Lisa Desjardins: Other highly debated features? The plan would phase out the estate tax on large-scale, inherited wealth. Republicans say that tax hits family farms. Others say ending it is a giveaway to the rich. And there is also a change to one of the biggest deductions of them all — the home mortgage deduction. That would stay for current homeowners, but for anyone buying a new home, there would be a $500,000 limit. And there are dozens of smaller pieces, including like a the concerns of from some small businesses, that mean however much Republicans want tax cuts. Passage is not yet certain. Rep. Kevin Mccarthy: For every member, this could really become the most significant bill they ever make a decision in their term in Congress. Lisa Desjardins: Significant and soon. A full House vote is expected in the next two weeks. At the U.S. Capitol, I’m Lisa Desjardins for the PBS NewsHour. Judy Woodruff: There are some other important changes in this bill. It would create a minimum tax on corporate earnings overseas, but one that may be lower for some businesses than the U.S. corporate rate here. We’ll talk with the bill’s lead author after the news summary. Watch the Full Episode Nov 02 By Saher Khan Nov 02 By Andrew Taylor and Marcy Gordon, Associated Press Support Provided By:

pbs,N/A,News Wrap: Trump nominee for USDA chief scientist withdraws," In the day’s other news, President Trump nominated Jerome Powell to be the next chair of the Federal Reserve. He’s a Republican, and a member of the Fed’s board for the past five years. If confirmed by the Senate, he would replace Janet Yellen, a Democrat who served one term as chair. Later in the program, we’ll look at what this change means. Former Trump campaign official Sam Clovis has withdrawn as the nominee for chief scientist at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. He wrote to the president today, saying the political climate, quote, has made it impossible to receive balanced and fair consideration. Clovis faced criticism for a lack of science credentials, and for ties to George Papadopoulos, who pleaded guilty this week to lying about contacts with Russian intermediaries last year. The president’s former campaign chair, Paul Manafort, attacked the evidence against him today in a probe of Russian campaign meddling. His lawyers said the case is, quote, embellished. Manafort appeared in federal court in Washington along with his associate Rick Gates. They face a 12-count indictment including conspiracy and money laundering charges. The president is pressing for the death penalty for the man behind Tuesday’s truck rampage in New York. Overnight, and again today, Mr. Trump tweeted that Sayfullo Saipov should get the death penalty for killing eight people. But in Manhattan, Mayor Bill de Blasio said he does not believe the attacker should be executed. He spoke near the scene of the crime. Mayor Bill De Blasio: I’m not clear on all the legalities and I’m not a lawyer. I’m not someone who believes in the death penalty in general. I just don’t. I believe this is an individual who should rot in prison for the rest of his life. Judy Woodruff: Saipov, an Uzbek immigrant, now faces federal terrorism charges. President Trump initially said he should be sent to Guantanamo Bay. But today, he reversed himself and said there is, quote, something appropriate about keeping him in the home of the horrible crime he committed. A jury in Newark, New Jersey, heard closing arguments today in the federal bribery case against U.S. Senator Bob Menendez. Prosecutors called Menendez a, quote, “personal senator” for a wealthy eye doctor, accepting cash and lavish gifts in exchange for favors. Defense attorneys have denied the allegations. In Myanmar, de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi visited the scene of a crackdown on Rohingya Muslims. The Nobel Peace Prize winner had been criticized for not doing anything to stop the violence by Myanmar’s army and Buddhist militants. Today, she met with local officials amid tight security. Rohingya activists say she urged them to, quote, live peacefully and not quarrel. Scientists now say they’ve discovered a hidden space deep inside Egypt’s Great Pyramid of Giza. The royal burial monument is 4,500 years old. This would be the first new discovery inside the pyramid since the 19th century. The journal “Nature” reports that researchers found the empty space by using cosmic-ray imaging. Its purpose remains unclear. Back in this country, they broke ground today for a memorial to President Dwight Eisenhower in Washington. It followed years of disputes over the design. Final plans call for columns and statues near the National Mall in Washington. They depict Eisenhower as World War II commander in Europe, and later, as the 34th president, in the 1950s. The monument is set to be finished in 2020. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 81 points to close at 23516. The Nasdaq fell one point, and the S&amp;P 500 added a fraction. And, the Houston Astros are baseball’s world champions, for the first time since their founding in 1962. They scored a game seven victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers last night, 5-1. It was a boost for the city of Houston, still dealing with the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey. Watch the Full Episode Nov 02 By PBS NewsHour Support Provided By:

pbs,N/A,"Tax reform takes ‘fresh approach’ to help workers and spur growth, says Rep. Kevin Brady"," House Republicans unveiled an ambitious tax overhaul that they say will simplify American taxes and encourage economic growth. But critics argue that businesses and wealthy Americans are the biggest beneficiaries and that middle-class Americans stand to lose. Judy Woodruff speaks with Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, the lead author of the bill, for a closer look at the plan and chances for passage. Judy Woodruff: Let’s take a closer look at the ambitious tax overhaul plan unveiled by Congressional Republicans today and hear from both sides of the aisle. We start with Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, who chairs the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee and is the lead author of the bill. We spoke a short time ago and I asked if Americans will, in fact, keep more of what they earn under the Republican’s proposal. Rep. Kevin Brady: Yes, I’m convinced, one, people are going to see much lower taxes and keep more of their paychecks. But, secondly, we’re not stopping there. You know, we– we want higher paychecks. We get this economy going. It’s been stagnant for a decade. Most families are living on less than they’ve had before. So, that’s what this tax reform is all about. And, Judy, I never forget to remind people, we’re proposing a code so fair and simple, nine out of 10 Americans will be able to file using a simple postcard-style system. Boy, that benefits in time and hassle and headaches for every family. Judy Woodruff: Well, I ask you that because you’re also, of course, capping the mortgage deduction, doing away with the student loan deduction, and also state and local taxes deductions. So, isn’t that going to hurt some people? Rep. Kevin Brady: You know, I don’t believe it will, and here’s why. We keep the mortgage interest deductions, charitable deductions and property tax. We enlarge the child tax credit for families, make sure twice as many Americans will be able to use it. Then we lower the rates. We protect more of the first dollars. So, when you add all of that up, you see that Americans get to keep more of what they earn, including in high-tax states. And so, look, I think this is the tax reform Americans have been just starved for, for 31 years. Now we get a chance as a country to weigh this and take action. Judy Woodruff: What do you say to those critics, Chairman Brady, who say the bigger tax cuts, though, are going to go to wealthier Americans by doing away with the estate tax, by doing away with the alternative minimum tax? Rep. Kevin Brady: Well, as you know, the top rate remains at 39.6 percent as it is today. The AMT is really a double tax that can cost taxpayers sort of in the $200,000, $300,000 level a year, $75,000 a year. So, when you remove the AMT, repeal it, and, by the way, the death tax really hits the family-owned farms and business hard. That’s who really has the damage from it. So, look, there is tax relief at every level here because we want the growth. We want you, again, to have control of your paycheck. That’s all. Judy Woodruff: The other argument we’re hearing, Chairman Brady, is that the business tax cuts really do add up to be the biggest part of this between the corporate cut from 35 percent to 20 percent, and then, in addition the so-called S Corps, the pass-through businesses. They are going to get a significant tax cut. So, business is really the big beneficiary? Rep. Kevin Brady: Well, I don’t agree. I think it is middle class families and here’s why — the smallest paycheck in America today is the one whose job has moved overseas. And that’s the problem for now more than a decade, we’re continuing to see our jobs and headquarters and research and manufacturing leave. This is all about bringing those jobs back. And for main street business, you know, look that family-owned donut shop makes $62,000 a year working day and night and weekends. They’ll get a $3,000 tax cut that they’ll use to plow back into the community. So, look, I think the big winners are workers who want to see higher paychecks, middle-class families who just want to keep more of what they earn. Judy Woodruff: How do you know that cutting taxes on these employers is going to lead to more jobs, more hiring, and higher wages? I ask, again, because the studies that have been done, the vast majority of them show, that has not happened in the past. Rep. Kevin Brady: Well, I respectfully disagree, but here we can just look ourselves. Look at the last 10 years. If you think high tax rates on families and businesses work, you think the current status quo tax code worldwide is working for America, we all know it’s not, that America has fallen far behind our competitors. Our jobs are leaving, our local businesses can’t compete here or around the world. So, we are taking a fresh approach, leapfrogging America from nearly dead last into the lead pack, the best place on the planet for that next new company and jobs. We can change the direction of the economy. But have to act. The status quo, leaving things as they are, I don’t think that’s an option for families. Judy Woodruff: The other comment we hear, Chairman Brady, is the conservatives, fiscal conservatives who are worried about the deficit, worried about the debt. They’re saying this adds another $1.5 trillion in coming years on top of the $10 trillion that’s already forecast. Have Republicans just stopped making the deficit a focus and the debt? Rep. Kevin Brady: Yes, yes, no. Here’s what we know. If we want to continue these high deficits and debt, just keep things as they are. Keep the economy slow as it has been for a decade. It’s picking up now. Just allow that to continue. This is all about generating growth, jobs, paychecks. But guess what? State and local revenues for government increase when you get people back to work. It does the same for Washington as well. So, I’m convinced, Judy, that tax reform done right helps moves us towards a balanced budget, gets us out of the doldrums we’re in today. Judy Woodruff: When you say balanced budget, you mean you literally think this is going to bring the debt down? Rep. Kevin Brady: So, overtime, I believe, we’ll balance the budget in two ways. This will help us move toward it in two ways. One, because we do get so much of a stronger economy, but that alone isn’t enough. So, we eliminated, as you know, dozens and dozens and dozens of special interest provisions for business and families so we can lower the tax rate, get the economy booming. You have to do both, and that’s what this tax reform does. Judy Woodruff: And finally, president Trump says he expects to see this done before Christmas. Rep. Kevin Brady: We’re on that timetable. So, we’ve introduced today, the Ways and Means Committee will begin to take action next week. We expect to send to the floor shortly afterwards. And then, of course, the Senate is going to have their version. They’ll be making their improvements. We’ll work that together and find common ground. So, right now, Judy, we are on track to get this to the president’s desk by the end of the year. Judy Woodruff: So, massive, complex legislation gets done in less than, what, six weeks? Rep. Kevin Brady: Well, we are working — we’ve worked very hard and here’s probably the difference. Unlike health care, the president, the House and Senate have come together this fall, earlier on where we want to go. We worked, some of us, for more than six years to be ready for this moment. Yes, we’ll be looking to make improvements. We’ll get input going forward. But I’m convinced we can do this. Judy Woodruff: Chairman Kevin Brady of the House taxing committee — thank you very much. Rep. Kevin Brady: Thank you, Judy. Watch the Full Episode Nov 02 By Saher Khan Nov 02 By Andrew Taylor and Marcy Gordon, Associated Press Support Provided By:

pbs,N/A,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren: GOP tax plan is giveaway to giant corporations, not middle class"," The major tax cut proposed by House Republicans is “the biggest tax giveaway to giant corporations in modern memory, said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. Judy Woodruff gets reaction to the bill from Warren, plus the senator weighs in on revelations from a new book by Donna Brazile about the DNC, the 2016 election and whether the nominating process was rigged for Hillary Clinton. Judy Woodruff: And now for a Democratic response to the tax bill. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts sits on the Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee. I asked her to respond to the claims by President Trump and Republicans’ that the bill would lead to the largest tax cut in modern history. Sen. Elizabeth Warren: Well, it is the biggest tax giveaway to giant corporations in modern memory. I mean, because that’s what this is. Let’s not kid ourselves. It’s got lots of moving parts, but the key, the part that’s the whole central issue here is $2 trillion in giveaways to giant corporations. And you know who the biggest recipients of it are going to be? Number one recipient is estimated to be Wells Fargo, who will walk away with billions of dollars. You do remember Wells Fargo, the company that opened the fake accounts to cheat its own customers. Another big recipient will be the wealthy foreign investors who are estimated to make about $700 billion out of this deal. And the third big group is going to be the multinational companies who are going to get an even better break for investing in jobs overseas, instead of investing in jobs here at home. This thing is really horrible. Judy Woodruff: Well, Senator, let me ask you about a couple of points you just made. Sen. Elizabeth Warren: Sure. Judy Woodruff: Because as you know, the Republicans are saying, yes, we’re giving a break to corporations and small businesses because we believe that is going to lead to more jobs and higher wages, that we are going to grow the economy, and Americans are going to be better off. Sen. Elizabeth Warren: You know, this is the big lie that the Republicans have been selling now for decades. And we have evidence about it — let’s just be clear — when the George W. Bush tax cuts went through in the early 2000s, what happened? Corporations walked out with sacks and sacks of money and wages stayed flat for American workers. Oh, over in Great Britain, they lowered the corporate tax rate by 11 points, and what happened? The wages went down for most workers. But here’s the deal — look at it this way: right now, corporate profits are at an all-time high. These corporations are rolling in money. If they wanted money to be able to invest in the American economy, they got it. The idea that somehow if we give them a couple of trillion dollars that they’re going to come invest in America, particularly when we give it to them in a form so that they get more incentives for investing outside America — I’m telling you, today, given the evidence, given what this tax bill looks like, that is an insult to working families across America. Judy Woodruff: Well, Senator, what they are saying- we just talked to Chairman Kevin Brady, of course, the House taxing committee, the Ways and Means Committee, saying by putting a minimum tax on profits corporation earn overseas, that it’s going to be — it means that money is going to come back to the United States, and they’re going to be able to invest it here. Isn’t that — my question to you is, is that not an approach that makes sense? Sen. Elizabeth Warren: Let me just — can I just slightly rephrase what he’s saying that’s a little more factual. By taxing corporation less on what they earn from their investments overseas, then we tax them on what they earn from their investments here in the United States, we’re going to grow the American economy. No, that’s not going to happen. It makes no sense. And, of course, they’ve got no evidence to back it up, because it just doesn’t work that way. Judy Woodruff: Well, let me ask you about the other part of this tax proposal, and that is what they say is a significant tax cut for middle-income Americans. And they talk about the average family is going to bring home at least around $1,200 a year more than they have today. They talk about other breaks. They’re doing away with the alternative minimum tax. And they list other breaks that would exist for many, many American families. Sen. Elizabeth Warren: So, look, I have been working, as you know, for decades now on trying to get some economic fairness and economic relief for working families, for paycheck-to-paycheck families, for middle-class families. And if what the Republicans really wanted to do was sit down and do a tax plan that would really help middle-class families, then, I would be all in. But that’s not what they’re talking about here. In fact, they’re going to raise taxes on a whole lot of people. But the key starts with that $2 trillion giveaway. As soon as they give away $2 trillion — I just want you think for a minute about what they might have done with that money. They could have spent that money on infrastructure right here in the United States, created good jobs right here, and built us a 21st century infrastructure that would give our businesses a competitive advantage all around the world. They could have taken that $2 trillion and said, let’s forgive the outstanding student loan debt for lots of our young people. Let’s get them into this economy, working hard, starting their own businesses. That would work. Or they could have said, I know, let’s write a check for $17,000 to every single family in America making less than $200,000. And they still would have had money left over. There are a lot of ways that we could have spent $2 trillion on building a stronger economy for work families. But the Republicans chose none of that. They want to give that money away to their biggest corporate donors. Judy Woodruff: Senator, is there any part of this tax proposal that you could work with? Sen. Elizabeth Warren: Oh, look, there are bits and pieces. And like I said, if we really were about the business of trying to help middle-class families, I’m in. But if they’re going to start with a $2 trillion giveaway to their biggest corporate donors, a $2 trillion giveaway to Wells Fargo, a $2 trillion giveaway to giant corporations that are helping fund campaigns for these Republicans, then my answer is no. You can’t start there and build something good for working families. Judy Woodruff: Senator, finally, a question on a different subject. We’re learning today that a new book that is coming out by Donna Brazile, the former acting chair of the Democratic National Committee, that the campaign of Secretary Hillary Clinton was far more influential at the Democratic Party, the Democratic National Committee, than we previously knew. Do you think what we’re learning from Donna Brazile’s book suggests that the campaign, that what the Democratic National Committee did meant this election was rigged? Sen. Elizabeth Warren: I think it was. Judy Woodruff: That’s a pretty powerful charge. Sen. Elizabeth Warren: Well, what we have to focus on now as Democrats is we recognize the process was rigged, and now it is up to Democrats to build a new process, a process that really works, and works for everyone. And as we go forward, we have confidence in the integrity of the system, that Democrats, as they run a primary, are going to let the people speak, and that we’re going to have a candidate who’s the candidate chosen by the people. That’s our job. Judy Woodruff: Senator Elizabeth Warren, thank you very much. Sen. Elizabeth Warren: Thank you. Watch the Full Episode Nov 02 By Erica R.

pbs,"Nov 2, 2017 6:10 PM EST",GOP senators say fate of ‘dreamers’ must wait for next year," Instead, they said, a solution would likely wait until next year for some 800,000 immigrants brought illegally to the United States as children. Those immigrants, known by supporters as Dreamers, are in limbo after Trump announced he was ending temporary deportation protections granted by the Obama administration and giving Congress until March to come up with a fix. Democrats have indicated they want to use a year-end spending bill to force action on Dreamers. Their votes will likely be needed to pass spending legislation to keep the government running, so the Trump-GOP stance may not end up prevailing. “No immigration bill on the omnibus or any other must-pass piece of legislation in 2017,” said GOP Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas after exiting the meeting with Trump. “He agreed to that, as does the Senate leadership, and I think the vast majority of Republican senators.” Sen. John Cornyn of Texas said using the so-called “omnibus” spending bill to resolve the status of Dreamers was “the pipe dream of some Democrats.” “It’s more likely than not to be part of a January-February time frame,” Cornyn said of dealing with immigration legislation. Immigrant advocates have been pushing for action. In September, Democratic leaders said they had a deal with Trump to enshrine protections for the immigrants in exchange for border security measures short of a border wall. But the supposed deal immediately came into dispute and now appears to have totally unraveled if it existed at all. Still, the Senate’s top Democrat voiced optimism. “There’s good Republican support for DACA and I think we can get it done,” said New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, using the shorthand for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Rep. Joe Crowley, D-N.Y., reminded Republicans that they need Democratic votes to pass the spending bill that expires in December or face a shutdown. “Unless Republicans can keep the government open without Democratic votes, this is not their decision to make,” Crowley said. “I have yet to see any evidence that they will be able to do that.” Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., said Republicans are trying to take away something that Democrats secured and trade for border security and other items they couldn’t get otherwise. “I’ve been at this a long time and I’m not going to allow you to trade against a gain and something that we have accomplished as Americans. It took a lot of work to get,” Gutierrez said. “We got it done. And we should fight for it.” Cotton said helping those in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program needs to come with measures designed to enhance enforcement of the nation’s immigration laws as well as ending what he called “chain migration,” where American citizens or lawful permanent residents sponsor family members to join them in the U.S. Cotton said that under the change he seeks, sponsors would only be able to get green cards for their spouse and their minor children. “Ending chain migration is essential to a DACA compromise, in my opinion,” Cotton said. The president tweeted on the topic of immigration shortly after the meeting, but didn’t mention the DACA program. Instead, he focused on Cotton’s concern. “Congress must end chain migration so that we can have a system that is SECURITY BASED! We need to make AMERICA SAFE!” Trump tweeted. Left:

pbs,"Nov 2, 2017 6:02 PM EST",Sen. Elizabeth Warren says 2016 Democratic primary was rigged," Warren’s statement came on the same day that Politico published a book excerpt from Donna Brazile, former interim acting chair of the Democratic National Committee, about her takeover of the committee and her promise to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders to investigate its nomination process. Leaked emails from a Russian hack of a DNC server, made public by WikiLeaks in July 2016, suggested top Democratic officials, including ousted DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz, favored Hillary Clinton over Sanders. Brazile also suggested that Clinton’s campaign was helping to finance the committee, which was facing large amounts of debt. When asked by PBS NewsHour’s Judy Woodruff whether she thought  the election was rigged, Warren said: “I think it was.” “The process was rigged and now it is up to Democrats to build a new process, a process that really works and works for everyone,” Warren said, adding that .people need to have confidence in the integrity of the system. “It’s got to have an outcome that really has the confidence of the people,” she said.

Lamar Smith says he won’t seek re-election after 16 terms in office," Smith, a Texas Republican, says in a statement Thursday “this seems like a good time to pass on the privilege of representing the 21st District to someone else.” He completes his term as committee chairman at the end of 2018. Smith is skeptical climate change is caused by human behavior. He also encouraged Americans to get their news from President Donald Trump and not the news media. Smith says it’s humbling to live in a small Washington apartment four nights a week. But he says traveling back to Texas most weekends “recharges the batteries.” He says he hopes to find other ways to stay involved in politics. Left:

He said during a recent visit to Africa, a young girl told him electricity was important to her because she has to read by the light of a fire with noxious fumes. Speaking at an event sponsored by Axios and NBC News, Perry said electricity also was important “from the standpoint of sexual assault. When the lights are on, when you have light that shines the righteousness, if you will, on those types of acts.” Perry’s remark comes as an uproar over sexual-assault allegations against film mogul Harvey Weinstein has spread to other industries and politics.

They filed a lawsuit Thursday in U.S. district court in Washington, D.C., on behalf of members of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. It accuses the acting head of the General Services Administration of violating a nearly 90-year-old law and preventing congressional oversight. A spokeswoman said the GSA doesn’t comment on pending litigation. The Trump Washington hotel in the federally-owned Old Post Office building lost more than $1 million dollars its first two months of operation. After Trump became president its fortunes reversed, turning a $1.97 million profit as of August. Left:

                                    — Updated on Nov 2, 2017 3:08 PM EST",WATCH: White House says North Korea could be listed as terrorism sponsor," The adviser, H.R. McMaster, says the administration is considering such a designation as part of Trump’s overall strategy to counter the North Korean nuclear threat. Watch McMaster speak in the video player above. McMaster cites the killing earlier this year in a Malaysian airport of the estranged half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as an act of terror that would qualify. Malaysia has never directly accused North Korea, but South Korea’s spy agency has claimed the attack was part of a plot by Kim to kill his relative. McMaster commented while briefing reporters on Trump’s five-nation tour of Asia, starting Friday. North Korea will be a key focus of Trump’s business in the region.

pbs,"Nov 2, 2017 1:18 PM EST",Do you plan to enroll for health care coverage under Obamacare? Tell us your story," Nearly 20 million Americans who have gained health insurance coverage through the ACA since 2010. After campaigning on promises to “repeal and replace,” President Donald Trump and Republican leaders in Congress have made several attempts this year to gut the health care law, so far without success. MORE: What you need to know about Obamacare signups under the Trump administration Still, there are several changes in store for those signing up for health insurance under the ACA this year. In October, frustrated by a lack of progress on health care legislation, Trump signed an executive order to boost lower-premium health plans, a move some experts say could further destabilize the health insurance markets. Consumers will have just six weeks, through Dec. 15, to sign up for health insurance through Obamacare — half the time of last year’s enrollment period. And advocates are concerned about the Department of Health and Human Services plans to shut down Healthcare.gov for maintenance for hours nearly every Sunday during open enrollment, a time many people use the site to navigate the often-confusing form to sign up for health insurance. So what does sign-up look like this year? Is this enrollment season better, worse or the same for millions of Americans signing up for health insurance coverage? The PBS NewsHour wants to hear your story. Whether it’s your first time to enter open enrollment or you’ve done this before, please use this form and share your story. Loading… Left:

This week, it was revealed that Clovis had communications with George Papadopoulos, who has admitted to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russian intermediaries. Questions have been raised about Clovis’ qualifications to serve as the Agriculture Department’s chief scientist. He is a self-described skeptic of climate change. Left:

pbs,"Nov 2, 2017 12:58 PM EST",Paul Manafort says evidence against him ’embellished’ in Russia probe," In a court filing Thursday, attorneys for Paul Manafort defended him as a “successful, international political consultant” who, by nature of his work on behalf of foreign political parties, was necessarily involved in international financial transactions. They say Manafort, who led Trump’s campaign for several months last year, has done nothing wrong and doesn’t pose a risk of fleeing the country. The filing was the first volley from Manafort’s defense team, which seeks to undermine a 12-count indictment against him and longtime business associate Rick Gates. Both men are scheduled to appear Thursday afternoon in Washington’s federal court. Mueller announced the indictment Monday charging the men with money laundering and other financial crimes related to their political consulting work for Ukraine’s former ruling party. They were placed on home confinement during a court appearance earlier this week, and both were released on multimillion-dollar bond amounts. In addition to the indictment of Manafort and Gates, prosecutors revealed a guilty plea from a campaign adviser named George Papadopoulos, who admitted lying to the FBI about foreign contacts during the campaign. Prosecutors disclosed additional details about the wealth of Manafort and Gates in a court filing Tuesday that sought to keep Manafort confined to his house. In the filing, prosecutors note that Manafort has provided differing accounts of his assets and that he has three different passports. In a response Thursday, Manafort’s attorney, Kevin Downing, countered that the passports are in his client’s name and noted that, though “it may be surprising to some, it is perfectly permissible to have more than one U.S. passport.” He also denied that Manafort was involved in any criminal activity related to his Ukrainian work, saying that all funds that went through offshore bank accounts were from “legal sources.” Downing said that Manafort was not trying to conceal his assets, noting that prosecutors say funds that originated in the Ukraine and went through Cyprus ultimately arrived in the United States. “Obviously, international funds entering the U.S. banking system, or going to U.S. vendors, are traceable and subject to U.S. process,” they said. “It goes without saying that in an international scheme to conceal assets, individuals generally move them offshore, not to the United States.” The defense lawyers also challenged the inclusion in the indictment of allegations that Manafort failed to register as a foreign agent with the Justice Department. The Justice Department, they said, has brought only six criminal prosecutions under that statute since 1966 and secured only one conviction during that period. Also Thursday, the government filed court papers seeking to restrain Manafort from selling, drawing on or transferring a life insurance policy. Prosecutors are seeking to seize the policy, saying they believe it is the proceeds of criminal conduct. Left:

pbs,"Nov 2, 2017 10:36 AM EST",WATCH: What’s in the tax plan put forth by House Republicans?," GOP leaders briefed rank-and-file lawmakers on the proposal Thursday morning ahead of a formal rollout and a show of unity event at the White House with President Donald Trump. A major revamp of the tax code, the first in three decades, is a top legislative and political priority of Republicans. Details were contained in a summary obtained by The Associated Press. The proposal would leave intact the existing rules on 401(k) retirement accounts and the ability of Americans to contribute up to $18,000 into the accounts tax-free. But the plan limits the widely used deduction for mortgage interest for newly purchased homes at up to $500,000, a sharp reduction from the current $1 million cap. The plan also limits the deductibility of local property taxes to $10,000 while eliminating the deduction for state income taxes, which generated significant opposition from Republicans in high-tax states such as New York and New Jersey. “I view the elimination of the deduction as a geographic redistribution of wealth, picking winners and losers,” said Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., who represents eastern Long Island. “I don’t want my home state to be a loser, and that really shouldn’t come as any surprise.” The child tax credit would be increased from $1,000 to $1,600, though the $4,050 per child exemption would be repealed. The legislation is a longstanding goal for Capitol Hill Republicans who see a once-in-a-generation opportunity to clean up an inefficient, loophole-cluttered tax code. But there is lingering opposition from northeastern Republicans fearful of losing a cherished deduction for state and local taxes and anxiety among other rank-and-file lawmakers over emerging details. Influential conservative Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., dismissed proposed retirement changes as a “non-starter,” adding “that’s what most of middle-income America uses as their nest egg.” The plan shrinks the number of tax brackets from seven to three or four, with respective tax rates of 12 percent, 25 percent, 35 percent and a category still to be determined. The tax system would be simplified, and most people would be able to file their returns on a postcard-sized form. The plan calls for nearly doubling the standard deduction used by most average Americans to $12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for families, and increasing the per-child tax credit. On net, it could mean tax increases for many upper middle-income families. The plan slashes the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent, a demand of Trump. It also repeals the inheritance taxes on multimillion-dollar estates, a big break for the wealthy. Republicans and Trump argue that sharply cutting tax rates for businesses improves U.S. economic competitiveness, but the possibility of letting the lower corporate rates expire is rankling some longtime advocates who say the uncertainty could limit its boost to the economy. The ambitious timetable calls for passing the complex measure in the House by Thanksgiving. “Failure is not an option,” said Rep. Chris Collins, R-N.Y. The emerging plan would retain the Clinton-era 39.6 percent income tax rate for the wealthiest earners. But for that highest bracket, the tax writers were considering raising the minimum level of income to $1 million for couples or families from the current $470,000 — a change that would reduce tax revenue. Meadows, the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, said he was worried about eligibility limits that could prevent some businesses from taking advantage of a lower 25 percent tax rate. “How as a Republican can we pick winners and losers that way? I mean it makes absolutely, certifiably no sense,” Meadows said. Trump set an aggressive timetable for the legislation and predicted a grand signing ceremony before Christmas at “the biggest tax event in the history of our country.” Democrats have repeatedly complained the plan was too favorable to business and the wealthy, and contradicted Trump’s rhetoric of bringing tax relief and economic benefit to the stressed middle class.

pbs,"Nov 1, 2017 7:00 PM EST",Could Trump send the New York City terror suspect to Guantanamo?," The one-two developments marked a sharp disconnect between the president and his administration. Trump had professed himself to be open to the idea of sending Saipov to Guantanamo in a seemingly off-the-cuff answer to questions from reporters. “I would certainly consider that, send him to Gitmo,” Trump said, using the familiar shorthand for the detention center. The White House later reinforced that idea by saying it considered Saipov to be an “enemy combatant.” But with the filing of federal charges, there was little indication that the threat of Guantanamo was anything more than tough talk. No one held within the U.S. has been sent to Guantanamo since the detention center opened in January 2002 to hold suspected members of al-Qaida and the Taliban. Still, elected officials routinely raise the prospect of doing so after attacks as a way to signal toughness in the fight against terrorism. Trump joined those ranks a day after a driver veered into a city bike path in Manhattan killing eight people. The president agreed that the U.S. base in Cuba would be an option for Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan who authorities say was inspired by the Islamic State. The U.S. has to come up with a method of punishment that is “far quicker and far greater than the animals are getting right now,” Trump said. The suspect in Tuesday’s fatal truck attack in New York City faces two counts of federal terrorism charges, prosecutors said Wednesday night. It is an open question whether the administration could send Saipov to Guantanamo Bay, in part because courts have not ruled whether the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force — which permits the government to detain enemy combatants for the duration of a military conflict — applies to the Islamic State and its followers, said Stephen Vladeck, a national security law professor at the University of Texas at Austin. The Islamic State did not exist when the authorization was passed. Vladeck noted that American criminal courts, which have secured hundreds of terrorism-related convictions since Sept. 11, have been more efficient than the military tribunal process at Guantanamo Bay. Just seven men have been convicted either by trial before military commission or through plea bargains, including four whose convictions were later overturned on appeal or invalidated. There are another seven held at Guantanamo still facing trial, including five men charged in the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attack and another accused of orchestrating the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole. Those cases are bogged down in pretrial litigation and are likely years from resolution. “If the goal is to actually punish the perpetrator, then sending him to Guantanamo is just about the worst thing you can do,” Vladeck said. The only advantage that Guantanamo might have is that men can be held there indefinitely without charge, said Bryan Broyles, the former chief defense counsel for the commissions, which combine elements of military and civilian court. “There is no other benefit to Guantanamo,” Broyles said. “It’s more expensive. It’s harder to use. It’s slower to use and it lacks the legitimacy in the international community.” Amnesty International USA said it would be a “grave mistake” to send Saipov to Guantanamo. “He’s a criminal suspect and should be treated as such by the U.S. justice system,” said Daphne Eviatar, director of the group’s security with human rights program. Trump said during the campaign that he wanted to fill Guantanamo with “bad dudes.” But the Justice Department last week opted to send a man accused of playing an instrumental role in the 2012 Benghazi attacks to federal court in Washington to face charges — not Guantanamo. Similarly, the U.S. on Wednesday indicted 36-year-old Mirsad Kandic in federal court in New York. Prosecutors say he recruited and facilitated the travel of foreign fighters to join the Islamic State and extradited him from Bosnia. In at least a physical sense, there are no practical reasons why the U.S. couldn’t hold someone at Guantanamo. The detention center, which reached a maximum population of about 680 in the summer of 2003, is now down to just 41, and there is plenty of space for more. Asked if there were any plans to add anyone, a detention center spokeswoman had no immediate comment. The Pentagon and a base spokeswoman referred questions to the Justice Department. Associated Press writers Eric Tucker, Sadie Gurman and Ken Thomas in Washington contributed to this report. Left:

pbs,N/A,News Wrap: House GOP scramble to finalize tax plan," House Republicans are scrambling to finalize a plan to cut taxes, after delaying the release of the bill to buy an extra day of negotiations. Members of the House Ways and Means Committee were cloistered behind closed doors today, but President Trump spoke at a White House Cabinet meeting. He said he would be standing beside Republicans when they debuted the tax plan tomorrow. President Donald Trump: The House Ways and Means Committee will unveil a historic tax plan that will create new jobs, higher wages, which hasn’t happened in many years. And now it’s starting to happen, I’m happy to tell you. But it’ll lead to tremendous prosperity for American families, communities, and also for our job-producing businesses. Hari Sreenivasan: The president also tweeted his support for using the tax bill to repeal Obamacare’s individual mandate. A Navy investigation has found that two deadly ship collisions this year were caused by preventable errors made by underprepared crews. The report blamed no one individual, but instead found a broader problem of watch crews that didn’t adhere to protocol. The USS Fitzgerald and USS John McCain crashes left a combined total of 17 sailors dead. NPR’s news chief, Michael Oreskes, has resigned following accusations of sexual harassment. Two women accused Oreskes of abruptly kissing them while they were discussing job opportunities when he worked for The New York Times nearly two decades ago. In a statement, Oreskes apologized, saying — quote — My behavior was wrong and inexcusable, and I accept full responsibility.” British Defense Secretary Michael Fallon also stepped down today in the wake of allegations of inappropriate behavior toward a female broadcaster. Earlier this week, a British newspaper reported Fallon repeatedly touched a woman’s knee at a 2002 event. In a statement today, Fallon said his previous conduct had fallen below the high standards of someone in his position. A Saudi-led coalition airstrike in Yemen today killed at least 29 people, including some children. Dozens of people were also injured. The bombs hit a market and a hotel in northern Saada province, where the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels are concentrated. The coalition has waged a punishing air campaign on the Houthis since 2015, after they ousted the Yemeni government. Some 100,000 civilians have died in the war. Back in this country, President Trump’s commission on the opioid crisis issued its final recommendations today. They include expanding drug courts to all federal districts, increasing access to rehabilitation programs for substance abusers, and more training for doctors. But the commission didn’t request any additional funding. The report comes nearly a week after the president called the opioid epidemic a — quote — “public health emergency.” At the United Nations today, the U.S. voted against a resolution calling for an end to its trade embargo on Cuba. U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley’s no-vote marks a course change from the Obama administration, which sought closer ties with Havana. The resolution passed 191-2, with only Israel joining the U.S. in opposition. And stocks were mixed on Wall Street today, after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged. The Dow Jones industrial average gained more than 57 points to close at 23435. The Nasdaq fell 11 points, and the S&amp;P 500 rose four.

pbs,N/A,"Facing tougher questions on Russian interference, social media giants vow to do better"," What role did social media play in Russian efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election? We now know fake accounts created by Moscow reached more Americans than the total number of U.S. citizens who voted. For the record, the NewsHour has worked with both Facebook and Twitter. The three tech giants were back on Capitol Hill today. Appearing before two separate congressional Intelligence Committees, Facebook, Twitter and Google lawyers faced tougher questions than yesterday. First, at the Senate Intelligence Committee, the Democrat from California, Dianne Feinstein– Sen. Dianne Feinstein: I must say, I don’t think you get it, that what we’re talking about is a cataclysmic change. What we’re talking about is the beginning of cyber-warfare. We are not going to go away, gentleman. And this is a very big deal. Hari Sreenivasan: Yesterday, Facebook admitted that from June 2015 to August 2017, 120 fake Russian accounts posted 80,000 times and reached as many as 126 million Americans. That number was revised to nearly 150 million today, as 16 million more people were reached by Russian Instagram posts. All three companies admitted fault again. Facebook’s general counsel, Colin Stretch– Colin Stretch: The fact that foreign actors were able to use our platform to exploit that openness is a deeply painful lesson for us, and one we’re focused on learning from going forward. Hari Sreenivasan: The representatives vowed to invest more money, time and people to do better. At times, lawmakers used the hearing to draw partisan lines on Russia’s impact on the election. Republican from Florida Marco Rubio: Sen. Marco Rubio: These operations, they’re much more widespread than one election. And it’s about our general political climate. Is that correct? Colin Stretch: I would certainly agree with that statement, Senator. Hari Sreenivasan: Democratic Senator from New Mexico Martin Heinrich: Sen. Martin Heinrich: Last month, President Trump called Russian-purchased Facebook ads a hoax. Are they, in fact, a hoax? Colin Stretch: No. The existence of those ads were on Facebook, and wasn’t a hoax. Hari Sreenivasan: The House Intelligence Committee released dozens of those ads, some exhibited with blown-up versions. Lawmakers chided Facebook for their existence. All of the ads focused on hot-button, divisive issues, one for an event called — quote — “Down With Hillary” by the group Being Patriotic, another mirroring the social movement Black Lives Matter. Back on the Senate side, Twitter was singled out multiple times. The Republican Senator from Arkansas Tom Cotton questioned where Twitter’s loyalties lie. Sen. Tom Cotton: Is it biased to side with America over our adversaries? Sean Edgett: We are trying to be unbiased around the world. Hari Sreenivasan: Top Democrat on the Senate Committee Mark Warner expressed doubt over Twitters’ claim that it found only about 2,800 accounts linked to Russian operatives. Sen. Mark Warner: I’m concerned, sir, that Twitter seems to be vastly underestimating the number of fake accounts and bots pushing disinformation. Independent researchers, people who have testified before this committee, have estimated that up to 15 percent of active Twitter accounts, or potentially 45 million-plus accounts, are fake or automated. Hari Sreenivasan: Representatives from each company said none has yet to identify the full scope of Russian interference on their platforms. Watch the Full Episode Nov 01 By Erica R.

pbs,"Nov 1, 2017 6:33 PM EST",Trump signs GOP repeal of banking rule that allowed consumers to join together in lawsuits," The president signed the measure at the White House in private. Journalists were not present to witness the signing. The Republican-led Senate narrowly voted to repeal the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s regulation, which the banking industry had been seeking to roll back. The Trump administration and Republicans have pushed to undo regulations they say harm the free market and lead to frivolous lawsuits. Democrats contend the rule would have given consumers more leverage to stop companies from financial wrongdoing. CFPB Director Richard Cordray, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, said in a statement that Trump had “signed away consumers’ right to their day in court.” “This action tips the scales of justice in favor of Wall Street banks less than ten years after they caused the financial crisis,” Cordray said. If the rule had been allowed to go into effect in 2019, it could have exposed banks to large class-action lawsuits, a possibility that has taken gotten more attention following the sales practices scandal at Wells Fargo and the security breach at credit company Equifax. The repeal means bank customers will still be subject to what are known as mandatory arbitration clauses. These clauses are buried in the fine print of nearly every checking account, credit card, payday loan, auto loan or other financial services contract and require customers to use arbitration to resolve any dispute with their bank. They effectively waive the customer’s right to sue. The overturning of the rule marks a notable victory for Wall Street. After the financial crisis, Congress and the Obama administration installed tough new regulations on how banks operated and fined them tens of billions of dollars for the damage they caused to the housing market. But since Trump’s victory last year, banking lobbyists have worked hard to get some of the rules repealed or replaced altogether. READ MORE: Senate GOP votes to repeal consumer rule Left:

pbs,N/A,Debating Trump’s reaction to the New York attack," The president responds to another terror attack on U.S. soil, while Republicans on Capitol Hill continue to debate the path forward on tax reform, and Trump campaign associate are handed indictments in a federal probe into 2016 election interference. John Yang has that. John Yang: Thanks, Hari. For two different perspectives on these stories, we’re joined by Karine Jean-Pierre. She’s a senior adviser to MoveOn.org, a contributing editor to “Bustle,” which is an online women’s magazine, and a veteran of the Obama administration. Also, Chris Buskirk, editor of the conservative blog AmericanGreatness.org. He’s also a radio talk host out in Phoenix. He joins us tonight from San Francisco. Welcome to you both. Chris, I would like to start with you. Much is being made about the difference or the seeming difference between President Trump’s response to the shootings in Las Vegas and this attack yesterday in New York. After Las Vegas, he said it’s not the time to have a policy debate, it’s time to focus on the victims. This time, he seemed to jump right into a policy debate about the diversity visa lottery program, and he identified a culprit, Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate leader in the senate. What do you make of this, Chris? Chris Buskirk: It’s because we know a key fact that is different in these two incidents, and I think that key fact kind of drives where the debate goes. You know, in Las Vegas, we had — we had the sort of lone gunman who was not acting on ideology that was — at least one that was discernible. In New York, we had somebody who was acting on a very definable and knowable ideology, an ideology that we have unfortunately seen come back and kill thousands of Americans time — well, over time, has killed thousands of Americans, has killed thousands of people throughout the West. And so we can sort of get past that part and say, well, what drove this person to do it? We know that. We know that already with the New York attacker. It was Islamic supremacism. He said so. We know that. And so we get on to the part and say, well, what do we do about it? Is there a way to make Americans safer? And what the president was reacting to is, he was looking and saying, we played the so-called diversity lottery on immigration, and we lost. So, let’s try and change policy again in a way that can make Americans safer, more protected. John Yang: Karine? Karine Jean-pierre: Look, first, I want to say my thoughts and prayers go out to the families in New York City that were affected by this horrific event. I’m from New York. I grew up there. New York is incredibly resilient, and I know that they will bounce back. Look, terrorism shouldn’t be politicized. And it is troubling and pretty shameful that that’s the first place that this president went to in the aftermath of this horrific event. And, look, there is a stark difference. Let’s be very clear. In Las Vegas, you had a white man who killed 58 Americans and injured more than 600 people. The White House was silent on his motive. They were silent about him. And they took a page out of a playbook of NRA, and didn’t want to talk about how to move forward with policy, how to prevent these types of mass shootings. And last night, with the eight people dead and 11 people injured, it was — he couldn’t wait. He ran to Twitter and started tweeting about immigration policy. And then, after that, he went and attacked a New York senator who was busy trying to figure out how he’s going to help out his constituents and help out the responders in New York City, and that’s what he decided to do. And there is also this type of — kind of thing that he continues to do, which is, like he did with the San Juan mayor, which is attack local officials who are trying to do the best that they can with what’s happening in — with their constituency in their city and their state. John Yang: Chris, I want to pick up on that point about going after Chuck Schumer. Yes, he did introduce the legislation when he was in the House that led to the diversity visa — diversity visa lottery. But he also tried to get rid of it in the Gang of Eight, the immigration overhaul. That died — it passed the Senate, but died in the House, the Republican House. Is that — I think a lot of people were taken by that, by immediately making — trying to make Schumer the culprit in this. Chris Buskirk: Yes, well, look, I say this, and I say this for both sides of the aisle. Let’s let politics be political. And when we have something that requires a policy response, I say, fine, let’s have at it. And let’s have that debate, because Americans’ lives on the line. When it comes to Chuck Schumer specifically in this case, I think the good news for Senator Schumer is, he’s going to get another bite at the apple. If he really wants to repeal the diversity lottery program that he was in part responsible for — he sponsored it in the House — he’s going to get another chance to do that. And he should sponsor a clean bill, just an up-or-down bill, nothing attached to it, that repeals that, if that’s what he’s serious about. Karine Jean-pierre: The problem is not Senator Chuck Schumer. The problem is the president of the United States, when, at times like these, past presidents, both Democrats and both Republicans, have unified this country and brought people together in these times. And he just refuses to do that. He refuses to grow into the office of the presidency. He wants to divide and just continue to govern for a very small part of this country. John Yang: Chris, another big event this week, of course, the first charges by the — in the Mueller investigation on Monday. We’re now seeing reports that the president is being advised by some advisers to get a little tougher in this, to be a little more combative, taking on Mueller, maybe even talk about trying to cut off the funding for the investigation. Do you think that would be a good idea? Chris Buskirk: Yes, I don’t know if it would be a good idea to cut off the funding for the investigation. That’s a — that’s a purely political question. It’s a complicated one. What I will say is that I think a lot of attention needs to be paid to Robert Mueller and to Rod Rosenstein, for that matter, too. These are two people who I think, the more we dig into their records, particularly when you look at something like Uranium One, they’re deeply compromised. And I think it bears keeping the spotlight on them as well. I mean, these indictments over the weekend, after all the ink that’s been spilled, all the hyperventilating about Russian collusion, the only thing that Robert Mueller can come up with is an almost-15-year-old tax fraud case? It just — it beggars belief that this is what he’s doing, and you wonder — you have to wonder why. Karine Jean-pierre: I think this is just the beginning of Robert Mueller’s investigation. We have a long ways to go. Look, I think Donald Trump has made this really clear as to what he thinks about this investigation. He thinks it’s a hoax. This is what he’s told the American people. And we should really listen to him and believe him when he says that, because, as we saw with FBI — former FBI Director Comey, he’s not afraid to obstruct. He’s not afraid to fire — to fire people. So I think we have to be really mindful. We can’t — I think Congress needs to really make sure that they protect Mueller, they protect his budget, they protect the investigation, because if Donald Trump does indeed fire Mueller, we will be in a constitutional crisis. John Yang: You know, Chris, I always sort of turn to you for — you have got a very good feel for the president’s base. He called The New York Times this afternoon to tell them that he’s really not angry over this, over this Russia investigation, over the indictments. Does his base want him to be angrier about this and to fight back on this? Chris Buskirk: I think — I don’t know about angry. I think that’s the wrong word. I think that the base looks at the Mueller investigation and says, this is not about — this is not about Donald Trump, per se. He is, of course, talked about a lot with regard to the Mueller investigation. This is basically about what we found out is a Clinton campaign/DNC dirty trick cooked up last week, right? They paid for the Fusion GPS dossier. And this is something that has now been turned into a cooked-up scandal. It’s a Beltway scandal that is trying to overturn the results of the election. And so do people who support the president want him to be angry? No, but maybe indignant is a better word, is to say, why are we allowing this to go on? We had the election. We know that this is really something that was cooked up during the campaign to try and win the election. That didn’t work. And so now it’s being used as a way to try and undermine the president and to prevent him from governing after the election. People don’t like that. And I do think people want that story to be told. John Yang: Quickly. Karine Jean-pierre: Yes. Well, there’s a larger part of the population that wants to know exactly what happened. We have a foreign government that compromised — potentially compromised our election, and that’s the cornerstone of our democracy. John Yang: Karine, that has got to be the last word. Karine Jean-Pierre, Chris Buskirk, thanks so much for joining us. Chris Buskirk: Thanks, John.  Watch the Full Episode Nov 01 By PBS NewsHour Nov 01 By PBS NewsHour Support Provided By:

pbs,"Nov 1, 2017 5:36 PM EST",San Juan mayor questions abrupt postponement of House hearing about Hurricane Maria," Cruz, who has tangled with President Donald Trump about the federal response, suggested the White House did not want to hear her criticism. “There was a meeting scheduled for today that was canceled as I was getting to Washington,” she said during a news conference with Democratic House members. “It is evident that this administration does not want to listen to the truth and does not want to own up to it.” The mayor was referring to a hearing about the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s preparedness and response capabilities that was scheduled for Wednesday morning and was supposed to include testimony from both Cruz and FEMA Administrator Brock Long. Rep. Bennie G. Thompson of Mississippi, the top Democrat on the Homeland Security Committee, who had invited Cruz to testify, told reporters he was given no explanation for the postponement. “It is inexcusable that the Republicans have delayed this hearing for the third time with no rational reason in a blatant attempt to silence the mayor and shield the Trump administration from another bad news story,” he said. A committee aide told The Associated Press that Thompson had requested the witness Friday evening, leaving only the weekend to plan for a panel of state and local witnesses. READ MORE: White House calls San Juan mayor’s latest criticisms of Trump ‘sad’ The aide, who was not authorized to speak to reporters and spoke on condition of anonymity, said that given the short turnaround time it was not possible to assemble a full second panel of witnesses to reflect areas of the country affected by recent natural disasters. Cruz reiterated her criticism about the federal response, which she called “inadequate” and “insufficient.” “The situation is still a life or death situation” a month after Maria hit the island, she said. “Survival cannot be our new way of life.” Cruz objected to the grade of 10 out of 10 that Trump has given to the federal response to hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico. “It really is 10 out of 100. President Trump lives in an alternate reality. While we are feeding our people, he is in Mar-a-Lago playing golf,” she said. Cruz asked that Congress spare humanitarian aid to Puerto Rico for four years from the Jones Act, a federal law that prohibits foreign-flagged ships from shuttling goods between U.S. ports. Cruz also said a federal control board that oversees Puerto Rico’s finances has taken $350 million away from municipalities, money that is much needed. Puerto Rican authorities have estimated that the island suffered an estimated $45 billion to $95 billion in damage. So far, Congress has approved nearly $5 billion in aid for the island. Cruz plans to meet Wednesday with Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Mark Warner, D-Va., before returning to San Juan on Thursday morning. Left:

Watch live in the player above. The Department of Homeland Security said Wednesday afternoon that the suspect in the New York City truck attack entered the United States in 2010 under the diversity visa program. That’s the immigration program that President Donald Trump is calling on Congress to eliminate “as soon as possible.” The president says the program is “not good,” and says the U.S. needs to “get much tougher.” The Diversity Immigrant Visa Program covers immigrants from countries with low rates of immigration to the U.S. Senate Republicans are coming to Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer’s defense after Mr. Trump tweeted that Democrats and Schumer were responsible for the program. Schumer was part of a group of Republicans and Democrats who backed a comprehensive immigration bill in 2013 to end the program as part of a broader bipartisan bill to overhaul U.S. immigration laws. GOP Sen. John McCain was part of that group. He said the bill would have eliminated the program and replaced it with a merit-based system. Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker said of Trump criticism: “Probably not the best way to bring out the best in our country.” North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis said of Trump’s hit on Schumer: “It’s not something I would do. We’ve all got different styles. It’s not the way I would handle it.” PBS NewsHour will update this story as it develops. By Joshua Barajas and Phil Hirschkorn Associated Press

pbs,"Nov 1, 2017 9:42 AM EST","Trump faults Schumer, ‘diversity’ immigration in NYC truck attack"," Trump said on Twitter that the driver in Tuesday’s attack “came into our country through what is called the ‘Diversity Visa Lottery Program,’ a Chuck Schumer beauty.” The terrorist came into our country through what is called the ""Diversity Visa Lottery Program,"" a Chuck Schumer beauty. I want merit based. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 1, 2017  Officials said the attacker is an immigrant from Uzbekistan who came to the U.S. legally in 2010. They haven’t said whether he came in through the Diversity Immigrant Visa Program, which covers immigrants from countries with low rates of immigration to the U.S. Trump also tweeted, “We are fighting hard for Merit Based immigration, no more Democrat Lottery Systems. We must get MUCH tougher (and smarter).” Trump has backed legislation that would curb legal immigration and shift the nation toward a system that would place an emphasis on merit and skills over family ties. The tweets followed Trump’s Tuesday night statement that he ordered the Department of Homeland Security “to step up our already Extreme Vetting Program.” Trump’s extreme-vetting policy on immigrants entails more stringent investigative measures intended to identify those who may sympathize with extremists or pose a national security risk to the United States. The diversity visa program provides up to 50,000 visas annually by lottery. Applicants must have a high school diploma or meet work experience requirements. It was created as part of a bipartisan immigration bill introduced by the late Sen. Ted Kennedy and signed into law President George H.W. Bush in 1990. Sen. Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat then a member of the House of Representatives, proposed a program for “diversity immigrants” in a bill he offered earlier that year. Schumer said in a statement Wednesday that he has “always believed and continue to believe that immigration is good for America,” adding that Trump is “politicizing and dividing America, which he always seems to do at times of national tragedy.” He said Trump had proposed cutting anti-terrorism funding in his most recent budget. “I’m calling on the president to immediately rescind his proposed cuts to this vital anti-terrorism funding,” Schumer said The White House did not immediately respond to questions about the president’s tweets. Trump cited “Fox and Friends” on Twitter as he attacked Schumer and the program Wednesday morning. Trump added: “We will stop this craziness.” Left:

pbs,"Oct 31, 2017 7:46 PM EST","Manafort’s assets are hard to quantify, federal prosecutors say in Russia probe"," The information comes one day after Manafort appeared in court on charges including money laundering and other financial crimes. In a court filing, the office of special counsel Robert Mueller says the precise value of Manafort’s assets is hard to quantify. They say in November 2016 and January 2017, he noted assets to be worth approximately $25 million, but he has provided significantly higher amounts at other times. READ MORE: Russia says they do ‘not see anything illegal’ after Mueller indictments The prosecutors say Manafort’s business associate, Rick Gates, who was also charged Monday, has also stated conflicting amounts. They say sentencing guideline ranges correspond to a possible punishment of 121 to 151 months of imprisonment for Gates, and 151 to 188 months for Manafort. Both pleaded not guilty.

pbs,"Oct 31, 2017 7:40 PM EST","Modernizing America’s nuclear arsenal would cost $1.2 trillion, CBO says"," The costs will accumulate over the next 30 years as existing weapons now considered outdated are replaced, according to the budget office, which projected the expenses will crowd out conventional weapons programs unless the Pentagon’s budget is increased substantially. Trump pledged during the presidential campaign to overhaul the nuclear arsenal. He pressed ahead after taking office with an Obama-era strategy to develop, build and field new submarines armed with nuclear missiles; new nuclear-capable bomber aircraft; and a new fleet of land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles. Also in the works is an upgrade of communications systems that enable the president and the Pentagon to command and control the atomic arsenal. U.S. military spending is currently constrained by a 2011 law that caps the annual budgets of federal agencies at predetermined levels. Lawmakers have fashioned temporary measures to get around the thresholds and boost the Pentagon’s budget above the capped amount, but never to the consistent levels senior military leaders say they need. Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, said in a statement that the numbers projected by CBO are sobering. “Congress still doesn’t seem to have any answers as to how we will pay for this effort, or what the trade-offs with other national security efforts will be if we maintain an arsenal of over 4,000 nuclear weapons and expand our capacity to produce more,” said Smith, who along with Rep. Pete Visclosky, D-Ind., asked for the report. An in-depth review of the U.S. nuclear force and the strategies and polices that underpin it has been underway since April. The study, ordered by Trump and known as a nuclear “posture” review, is unlikely to be completed and made public before the end of the year. But the review already is steering away from any major buildup in the size of the arsenal, officials familiar with the discussions said earlier this month. MORE: Here’s what goes into a president’s decision to launch nuclear weapons Instead, the focus is on maintaining the basic shape of a modernization plan Trump took over, with possible adjustments, and on ways to reverse a long decline in the Energy Department’s ability to build and sustain nuclear warheads. The CBO report listed a series of options that could generate savings of between $27 billion and $139 billion. One option called for delaying the new ICBM, the next-generation nuclear-capable bomber called the B-21 Raider, and new interoperable warheads that can be used in land and sea-based missiles. Another option would maintain the nuclear triad but with fewer ICBMs and missile-carrying nuclear submarines than planned. The Arms Control Association said in a statement that the CBO report undercuts the Pentagon’s claim there are no credible cost-cutting alternatives to its plan for building and maintaining a larger nuclear arsenal than it needs. The group also noted that if inflation is factored in, the 30-year cost will exceed $1.5 trillion. “The stark reality underlined by CBO is that unless the U.S. government finds a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, the nuclear weapons spending plan inherited by the Trump administration will pose a crushing affordability problem,” said Kingston Reif, the Arms Control Association’s director for disarmament and threat reduction policy.

pbs,"Oct 31, 2017 7:25 PM EST","In hearing on Russia, Facebook, Twitter, Google defend their security measures"," As revelations emerged that Russian-linked accounts reached many more American voters than previously thought, tech giants Facebook, Twitter and Google on Tuesday defended their security measures and promised a Senate subcommittee they would do more to stop the misuse of their platforms by foreign nations. Lawyers for the three companies acknowledged to U.S. lawmakers that Russian-linked accounts began exploiting their services in 2015 to sway last year’s presidential election. They also said the abuses continued after President Donald Trump took office, in an attempt to deepen divisions in the country. The admissions came Tuesday during appearances before a Senate subcommittee looking into Russia’s manipulation of influential communication channels to interfere in the 2016 election. The mischief came through advertising purchased on the services and posts containing misleading or false information. All three companies vowed to do a better job preventing similar interference from Russia and other “bad actors” in the future. Early on, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said the purpose of the hearing was for the government to “figure out how we can help” the tech companies. But in the second hour of the meeting, Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont said he’d been hearing a lot of “Johnny-come-latelies” from the companies when they could have done something earlier. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, meanwhile, pressed the companies to declare whether they will support the “Honest Ads” bill she has introduced with Sen. Mark Warner, which would bring political ad rules from TV, radio and print to the internet. Each of the tech giants offered qualified support rather than answering “yes.” “We stand ready to work with you and your co-sponsors on that legislation going forward,” said Facebook general counsel Colin Stretch, who was echoed by Twitter’s and Google’s representatives. WIDE REACH Facebook has disclosed that content generated by a Russian internet agency potentially reached as many as 126 million users. The company said pages created by Russia’s Internet Research Agency generated 80,000 posts on 120 pages between January 2015 and August 2017. Possible views reached the millions after people liked the posts and shared them. Testimony from Facebook’s Stretch made clear that many of those users may never have seen the material. The company said the total number represents around 1 out of 23,000 pieces of content on the site. These “organic” posts that appeared in Facebook users’ news feeds are distinct from more than 3,000 advertisements linked to the agency that Facebook has already turned over to congressional committees. The ads — many of which focused on divisive social issues — pointed people to the agency’s pages, where they could then like or share its material. WATCH: Facebook, Twitter, Google testify in Senate hearing on Russia Twitter told the subcommittee it has uncovered and shut down 2,752 accounts linked to the agency, which is known for promoting pro-Russian government positions. That number is nearly 14 times the number of accounts Twitter handed over to congressional committees three weeks ago. And Google said it found evidence of “limited” misuse of its services by the Russian group, as well as some YouTube channels that were likely backed by Russian agents. GROWING PRESSURE Lawmakers have pressured the social media companies to come forward and have criticized them for not being fully forthcoming immediately after the election. During the hearing, the companies also faced pressure for not noticing earlier that Russian election meddling was taking place on their platforms. “In hindsight, we should have had a broader lens,” Stretch said. On Twitter, the Russia-linked accounts put out 1.4 million election-related tweets from September through Nov. 15 last year — nearly half of them automated. The company also found nine Russian accounts that bought ads, most of which came from the state-backed news service RT, previously known as Russia Today. Twitter said last week it would no longer accept ads from RT and Sputnik, another state-sponsored news outlet. It will donate the $1.9 million it has earned from RT since 2011 to support external research into political uses of Twitter. Google said two accounts linked to the Russian group spent $4,700 on ads on its platforms during the 2016 election. The company also found 18 YouTube channels likely backed by Russian agents. Those channels hosted 1,108 videos with 43 hours of material, although they racked up just 309,000 views in the U.S. between June 2015 and November 2016, Google said. Google announced Monday that it will also verify the identity of election-related ad buyers and identify these advertisers publicly via ad icons. It will provide a public database of election ads detailing who purchased each one, and will publish a transparency report on election ads as well. All three companies will also testify Wednesday before the House and Senate intelligence committees as part of congressional probes of Russian election interference.

pbs,N/A,News Wrap: Trump meets with business leaders on tax reform," And in related news: President Trump took to Twitter today to downplay the role of a former campaign aide who pled guilty in the Russian probe. George Papadopoulos admitted to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russia. Today, Mr. Trump tweeted — quote — “Few people knew the young low-level volunteer named George, who has already proven to be a liar” — end quote. We will take a closer look at Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election after the news summary. Mr. Trump also met with business leaders at the White House to push his plans for tax reform. Emphasizing speed, the president said that he is — quote — “hopefully not looking” to phase in a corporate tax rate cut, something proposed by congressional Republicans. He revealed his economic advisers will stay in Washington during his upcoming Asia trip to help fine-tune the tax overhaul. President Donald Trump: I want the House to pass a bill by Thanksgiving. I want all of the people standing by my side when we get ready to sign by Christmas. Hopefully, before Christmas, you will all be in the room standing front-row center. I think we will be able to find a place where you can all stand front-row center. It will be a big event. It will be the biggest tax event in the history of our country. Judy Woodruff: House Republicans will unveil details of the tax reform legislation tomorrow. Another influential Republican member of Congress, Jeb Hensarling of Texas, announced today that he will not seek reelection in 2018. Hensarling has been elected eight times and currently chairs the House Financial Services Committee. He said he wants to spend more time with his family. At least a dozen GOP Congress members have announced they are retiring or resigning this year. The Federal Emergency Management Agency says it’s spending more than $200 million a day on disaster relief after the recent torrent of hurricanes and wildfires. Its administrator, Brock Long, told a Senate panel that the $52 billion approved by Congress for emergency relief isn’t enough. Long also had few answers about a canceled contract between Puerto Rico’s power authority and a company called Whitefish, a small Montana company that — chose to rebuild its ruined grid. Brock Long: There’s no lawyer inside FEMA that would have ever agreed to the language that was in that contract to begin with, so let me be very clear about that. And we raised the red flag. There were many things wrong. There was also language in there that would suggest that the federal government would never audit Whitefish. There’s not a lawyer inside FEMA that would ever agree to that type of language. Judy Woodruff: Two-thirds percent of Puerto Ricans are still without power more than a month after Hurricane Maria struck. Here in the U.S. mainland — mainland U.S., 800,000 customers across New England also woke up without electricity today. Crews worked through the night to restore downed power lines and to clear debris left behind from a powerful storm the night before. With the work just beginning, Halloween festivities were postponed in communities from Maine to Connecticut. Fran Poris: It’s hard to take a shower when it’s all cold water, and it’s hard to eat every cold meal without being cooked, because we don’t have gas. We only have an electric stove. It’s getting frustrating, and every time I call the power company, there’s no response about when it’s going to be over. If we had an end in sight, it would be a little easier. Judy Woodruff: Dozens of school districts across the Northeastern U.S. were also forced to cancel classes for a second straight day. Catalonia’s ousted leader has agreed to a snap election in December, called by Spain’s central government. It follows Madrid’s move to strip the region of its autonomy for declaring independence last week. Speaking in Brussels, the deposed Catalan leader insisted that he wasn’t seeking political asylum in Belgium, after Spain’s state prosecutor filed rebellion charges against him, and he vowed to keep up the fight for Catalonia’s independence. Carles Puigdemont: (Through interpreter) We continue with our work, despite the limits imposed on us by this strategy of non-confrontation, and we will defend the idea that the demand of the state is a political demand. So we will oppose it from a political standpoint, not a legal one. That means that we will not evade the actions of justice. We do not want to remove ourselves from the responsibilities in the face of justice. We will fight this serious injustice that the Spanish government is imposing politically. Judy Woodruff: Spain’s high court also summoned the ousted Catalan leader and members of his Cabinet to testify in Madrid Thursday on the rebellion charges that have been filed against them. President Trump’s chief of staff is drawing criticism for his defense of Confederate heritage and its military leader during the Civil War. In an interview Monday night with FOX News, retired Marine Corps General John Kelly made the case for keeping Confederate monuments as part of the nation’s history. Kelly spoke about the roots of the Civil War, without mentioning its root cause, slavery. John Kelly: Robert E. Lee was an honorable man. He was a man that gave up his country to fight for his state, which in — 150 years ago was more important than country. It was always loyalty to state first back in those days. Now it’s different today. But the lack of an ability to compromise led to the Civil War. Judy Woodruff: Today, the head of the Congressional Black Caucus, Congressman Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, issued a statement, saying that Kelly — quote — “needs a history lesson for minimizing slavery’s role in the run-up to the Civil War.” And stocks closed higher on Wall Street today. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 28 points to close at 23377. The Nasdaq rose more than 28, and the S&amp;P 500 added two.

pbs,N/A,What it was like to be in the White House when the first Mueller indictments came down," Since the unsealing of criminal charges and pleas as part of the Russia investigation, the White House has distanced itself from Paul Manafort, Rick Gates and George Papadopoulos. But how did President Trump and White House officials react behind the scenes? Judy Woodruff learns more from Ashley Parker of the Washington Post. Judy Woodruff: We return now to yesterday’s legal developments. With the unsealing of criminal charges and pleas, Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation may have entered a new phase. In public, the White House has distanced itself from Paul Manafort, Rick Gates and George Papadopoulos, but how are the president and White House officials reacting behind the scenes? Ashley Parker of The Washington Post has been reporting on al this. And she joins me now. So, Ashley, I think you and your colleagues said in your story that you talked to 20-some White House aides. What is the sense you’re getting from them of their handling — how they’re handling this, how they react to this? Ashley Parker: One thing that was striking was that the West Wing aides and the president himself were finding out the way sort of we were and the rest of America was, which was basically from news reports. So we sort of got to see the president processing that as it happened. So, for instance, after the first pair of indictments came down for Manafort and Gates, there were two feelings. One was, the president kind of felt vindicated. He felt, you know, look, these guys are being looked into for alleged behavior that largely predates my campaign. The indictment didn’t mention his name. It didn’t mention any possible collusion between his campaign and Russia. So, he sort of tweets out a kind of frustrated, but “this isn’t my issue, there’s no collusion” tweet. Judy Woodruff: Right. Ashley Parker: And then that next indictment comes down for George Papadopoulos, which is potentially more problematic. And, again, he uses the, as the White House has said, as you just said, he’s someone who was an unpaid volunteer. He wasn’t super senior. But that — he definitely touches Russia in a way that those people in the first indictment didn’t. Judy Woodruff: I noticed that the story quoted some in the White House — I think it — well, it was the president’s attorney Ty Cobb, saying that the president is just continuing his business as usual. He’s not getting distracted by this. But then the White House chief of staff, John Kelly, said in an interview last night on FOX News that the president is distracted. So, which is it do you think? Ashley Parker: I think you can argue that it’s business as usual, only in the sense that Russia has dogged this president and this White House since almost the very first day. But, look, I think he was frustrated. We were told that he is frustrated not because he thinks he did anything wrong, but for precisely the opposite reason. He feels like he did absolutely nothing wrong and he doesn’t understand why this just won’t go away and he keeps on getting dragged down. We reported that this is a guy who lives above the shop, so to speak. He stayed up in his residence longer than usual watching kind of TV, talking to his lawyers, growing frustrated, but also sort of thinking in terms of like a crisis communications manager, a legal analyst, before coming down to work in the Oval Office. But then, by all accounts, while he was there during the day, I heard from people that there were a number of meetings, and this didn’t come up at all in the sort of pre- or post-meeting chatter. So I think the answer is, the truth lies in the middle somewhere. Judy Woodruff: Just very quickly, Ashley, what are you hearing about any potential presidential pardon? Ashley Parker: So, the White House and the president’s lawyers have said recently that this is something that is not at all on his mind. It’s not something he’s planning to do. But our reporting from several weeks ago showed that the president had asked about precisely this. So, we know the president is sort of interested in understanding the full range of his pardon powers. That doesn’t mean that, as of today, he’s prepared to use them, but we know, with President Trump, that could change in a second. Judy Woodruff: Ashley Parker, reporting to on the White House for The Washington Post, thank you. Ashley Parker: Thank you.

pbs,"Oct 31, 2017 4:11 PM EST",Trump administration expected to defend embargo on Cuba in United Nations vote," WASHINGTON — The Trump administration will defend America’s decades-old economic embargo on Cuba in a United Nations vote this week, the State Department said Tuesday, in a reversal from the Obama administration that reflects deteriorating U.S.-Cuban relations. Every year the U.N. votes to condemn the embargo, and for years the U.S. predictably voted “no.” But last year, under President Barack Obama, the U.S. abstained for the first time, as Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro moved forward with the historic warming of relations. A “no” vote Wednesday from U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley will return the United States to a place of extreme isolation within the global community over its policy toward Cuba, potentially undermining the Trump administration’s broader goals for engagement with Latin America. The U.S. embargo on Cuba is almost universally opposed throughout the world. The vote comes as an ongoing crisis over U.S. government workers in Havana harmed by invisible “health attacks” has created a new rift between the U.S. and Cuba, putting the restoration of ties in jeopardy. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert did not mention the attacks in announcing the “no” vote, instead emphasizing the need to promote rights and democracy in Cuba. “For far too long, Cuba has engaged in human rights abuses — human rights abuses that perhaps past administrations have turned and looked the other way,” Nauert said. Still, she said the U.S. would continue pursuing engagement with the island that advances American interests. General Assembly resolutions are nonbinding and unenforceable. But the annual exercise has given Cuba a global stage to demonstrate how little support America’s commercial, economic and financial embargo enjoys. The yearly vote condemning the U.S. embargo has reliably passed overwhelmingly. Voting “no” means the U.S. will once again be pitted against almost every other nation. In 2015, the last year that the U.S. voted “no,” close ally Israel was the only country to join in opposition, leading to a 191-2 vote to condemn the embargo — the highest number of votes ever for the measure. The United States lost its only other ally in the vote, Palau, in 2013, when the Pacific island nation abstained rather than joining the U.S. in voting “no.” Since taking office, Trump has taken steps to partially roll back the rapprochement with Cuba, but has preserved many other changes put in place by Obama. Yet Cuba has complained bitterly about the U.S. response to the health attacks, which has included pulling most American diplomats out of Havana and suspending visa processing for Cubans at the embassy there. “To Cuba, it is unacceptable and immoral that the U.S. government has decided to take political decisions that harm the Cuban people,” he said. MORE: What happens to U.S.-Cuba relations amid mysterious attacks on diplomats? At least 24 U.S. government workers and their spouses are “medically confirmed” to have been affected by the unexplained attacks in Havana, the State Department has said. The victims suffered a range of medical conditions including permanent hearing loss and mild traumatic brain injury, known as concussion. Cuba vehemently denies any knowledge of involvement. The U.S. has not blamed Cuba for perpetrating the attacks and says it doesn’t know who is responsible, but has nonetheless faulted Castro’s government for failing to keep American diplomats safe in his country. The Cuban Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the planned U.S. “no” vote. In late 2014, Obama and Castro announced plans to restore relations, and the following year embassies were re-opened in Washington and Havana more than half a century after ties were cut in 1961. Although the Obama administration eased travel and commerce restrictions on Cuba, allowing direct commercial flights between the countries to resume, Obama was unable to persuade Congress to repeal the formal embargo. The Republican-led Congress has continued to support the far-reaching sanctions. The Obama administration’s decision last year to abstain rather than vote “no” was cheered in the 193-member General Assembly. Samantha Power, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. at the time, said the United States remained opposed to some of the Cuban government’s practices and policies but was pursuing a new approach to engagement with the island.

pbs,"Oct 31, 2017 4:01 PM EST",WATCH: Obama says ‘what’s wrong with our politics is a reflection of something wrong in our civic culture’," Obama calls the two-day event starting Tuesday a “collective conversation” to exchange ideas with young people and help spark change. He says a goal is to address civic culture, not create a political movement. Obama didn’t discuss politics aside from saying “what’s wrong with our politics is a reflection of something wrong in our civic culture.” Other summit guests include Prince Harry. He and former first lady Michelle Obama on Tuesday visited a Chicago high school near the site of Barack Obama’s planned presidential center. Michelle Obama is expected to speak Wednesday. The inaugural leadership summit is among several activities the Obama Foundation is planning. Among them is a fellowship for young leaders. The foundation is raising funds for the Obama Presidential Center, which is planned for Chicago’s South Side. Construction is expected to take four years. Photos displayed at a September community meeting about the center show a test kitchen, athletic center, and recording studio as possible features. Left:

pbs,"Oct 31, 2017 10:31 AM EST",Mueller probe of Trump administration enters new phase," Trump immediately sought to distance himself after Manafort and Rick Gates pleaded not guilty Monday to a 12-count indictment alleging money laundering, conspiracy and other offenses and as another former aide was revealed to be cooperating with authorities after entering a guilty plea for lying to the FBI. White House officials were publicly optimistic about Mueller’s investigation wrapping up swiftly, but the probe is far from over and its reach still uncertain. Trump has become increasingly concerned that the Mueller probe could be moving beyond Russia to an investigation into his personal dealings, two people familiar with the president’s thinking said. Trump expressed irritation Monday morning that he was being tarnished by his former aides. In the hours after the indictment, the president angrily told one confidant that Manafort had been a campaign “part-timer” who had only helped steer the convention and got too much credit for Trump’s ability to hold onto the nomination, according to a person familiar with the private discussion. Those describing Trump’s thinking or private discussions were not authorized to speak publicly about them and requested anonymity. Trump dismissed the money-laundering charges against Manafort as typical political corruption that did not reflect on his campaign, one of the persons said. The president also insisted that the charges predated Manafort’s time on the campaign and that he should not be held responsible for any prior misdeeds by Manafort. Trump took to Twitter to argue that allegations against Manafort were from “years ago” and asserted there was “NO COLLUSION” between his campaign and Russia. But the indictment against Manafort and Gates details allegations stretching from 2006 all the way to 2017. And Trump’s insistence that there was no collusion between his campaign and Russia was complicated by the revelation that campaign adviser George Papadopoulos was answering questions from prosecutors after admitting he lied about his unsuccessful attempts to broker a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The White House tried to play down the campaign role of Papadopoulos, whom Trump named as a foreign policy adviser in March 2016, saying the aide’s attempts to earn assistance from Russian nationals were unauthorized. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders dismissed him as an unpaid “volunteer” and said “no activity was ever done in an official capacity on behalf of the campaign in that regard.” Mueller’s office revealed in a court filing that Papadopoulos was now assisting the investigation as a “proactive cooperator.” Sanders minimized Trump’s reaction to the indictments. “He responded the same way the rest of us in the White House have,” she said, “and that’s without a lot of reaction because it doesn’t have anything to do with us.”  President Donald Trump’s press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders reacts to the news that former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort has been charged with conspiracy against the U.S. Trump fumed in recent weeks that he believes Mueller was taking an expansive view of his role and looking beyond the narrow definition of alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. The president publicly mused in a July interview that he might look to fire the special counsel if Mueller began looking into his business dealings, a possibility that has weighed on him in recent weeks, according to two people who have spoken to him but were not authorized to discuss private conversations. Trump tried a familiar ploy on Monday to shift attention to Democrats and his former rival, Hillary Clinton, asking on Twitter why they weren’t subjects of Mueller’s probe. But Trump’s attempts to discredit the investigation by Mueller, a former FBI director, threaten to alienate him from Republican lawmakers, who have supported the inquiry. Trump has at times chafed at his legal team’s advice to be deferential to Mueller’s investigation, toying with the notion of going on the offensive. Former Trump strategist Steve Bannon has encouraged the more aggressive approach, according to a person familiar with his thinking but not authorized to discuss it by name. The indictments of Manafort and Gates, his longtime protege, were largely anticipated by White House officials, who viewed the pair warily. And they expressed relief that Mueller’s charges against the two didn’t specifically pertain to Russia or Trump. Gates had been a key outside adviser, participating in meetings with White House officials as recently as last summer. The White House said Trump last recalled speaking with Manafort by phone in February. Manafort held a critical role in Trump’s campaign, spearheading his efforts to counter a concerted delegate challenge to his nomination in 2016. He had been recommended by Trump’s inner circle: first by longtime Trump friend Tom Barrack, who then urged Ivanka Trump to lobby her father on Manafort’s behalf. After the ouster of Corey Lewandowski as campaign manager in June 2016, Manafort became the de-facto campaign manager — though named campaign chairman — until he himself was pushed out in August 2016 over his lobbying work on behalf of pro-Russian officials in Ukraine. Gates remained part of the Trump campaign after Manafort’s departure and took on a role planning Trump’s inauguration under Barrack, for whom he has continued to work. He briefly was an adviser to the pro-Trump organization America First Policies. Lemire reported from New York. Associated Press writer Ken Thomas in Washington contributed to this report.

pbs,"Oct 31, 2017 10:05 AM EST","As Russia probe continues, some lawmakers want Trump to leave Mueller alone"," Concerned that the president may fight back after Mueller’s investigation into Russian meddling led to two indictments and a guilty plea for his former advisers Monday, top Democrats laid down a marker for the president, who earlier in the year criticized Mueller and the probe. “The president must not, under any circumstances and in any way, interfere with the special counsel’s work,” said Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer. “If he does, Congress must respond swiftly, unequivocally, and in a bipartisan way to ensure that the investigation continues and the truth — the whole truth — comes out.” Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, added, “Members of Congress, Republican and Democrat, must also make clear to the President that issuing pardons to any of his associates or to himself would be unacceptable, and result in immediate, bipartisan action by Congress.” Republicans were less explicit, but many sent a similar message. “I don’t think anybody in their right mind at the White House would think about replacing Mr. Mueller unless there was a very good reason,” said South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican who has been both a critic and a friend to Trump over the last year. Republican Sen. Bob Corker, a Trump critic, said he “can’t even imagine” that Trump would fire Mueller. Jay Sekulow, Trump’s personal lawyer, shot down both possibilities of firing Mueller and pardons in an interview Tuesday with ABC’s “Good Morning America.” “The president has not indicated to me or to anyone else that I work with that he has any intent on terminating Robert Mueller,” Sekulow said. On pardons, he said: “I have not had a conversation with the president regarding pardons. And pardons are not on the table.” Sekulow’s comments came a day after the first charges were announced by Mueller. Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his associate Rick Gates both pleaded not guilty to conspiracy and money laundering charges. Another former adviser, George Papadopoulos, pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents when asked about Russian contacts. White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters after the charges were released that “there is no intention or plan to make any changes in regards to the special counsel.” But lawmakers have been on guard since May, when Trump abruptly fired FBI Director James Comey and Mueller was appointed. Trump was initially more critical of the special counsel, and at one point his legal team looked into potential conflicts surrounding the team Mueller has hired, including the backgrounds of members and political contributions by some members of his team to Democrat Hillary Clinton. After Trump made those rumblings, two bipartisan bills emerged in the Senate Judiciary Committee that would attempt to protect any special counsel. Legislation sponsored by Graham would prevent the firing of any special counsel unless the dismissal was first reviewed by a panel of three federal judges. Legislation co-sponsored by Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina would let any special counsel for the Department of Justice challenge his or her removal in court. After an initial flurry of support, the bills have stalled as Trump has quieted his public criticism of Mueller. Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said he was undecided on the bills after some law experts questioned their legality in a hearing. As senators returned to the Capitol Monday evening for votes, many Republicans were lukewarm or declined to say whether they would support the legislation. Graham said of his own bill, “I don’t feel an urgent need to pass that law until you show me a reason Mr. Mueller is in jeopardy.” Some Republicans said they were reviewing the legislation. “It would be a problem” if Trump fires special counsel or pardons indicted people, said Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, another recent critic of Trump. The main message from Republicans was that the charges wouldn’t affect legislative work. Republicans are hoping to make some progress on tax reform, and are hoping to stay focused on that goal. “It doesn’t distract us in any way,” Corker said. “I don’t see it being a factor at all.” That remains to be seen, as Republicans have had a difficult time this year enacting any major policy as Trump has taken aim at some in his own party.  What are the political ramifications of the first indictments in Robert Mueller’s investigation into possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign? Amy Walter of the Cook Political Report and Tamara Keith of NPR join Judy Woodruff to discuss whether it’s a turning point in Washington for voters, for lawmakers or for President Trump’s agenda. It’s also unclear how the charges will affect several congressional investigations into the Russian interference and whether it was connected to Trump’s campaign. Neither the Senate nor the House intelligence committees have interviewed Papadopoulos or Gates, according to sources familiar with the probes. And only the Senate intelligence panel has talked to Manafort, The sources declined to be named because the committees’ interviews are private. As the investigations have gone on for several months, some Republicans have called for them to end. The Senate Judiciary Committee probe into the meddling and the House intelligence probe have split along partisan lines. And Democrats fumed last week as House Republicans launched new probes into Clinton and former President Barack Obama. Some Democrats indicated that the congressional investigations should step up as Mueller’s probe found new evidence. “It is a pretty sobering, shattering moment in American history,” Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democratic member of the Judiciary panel, said of the charges. “It is the end of the beginning, but not the beginning of the end.” Associated Press writer Alan Fram contributed to this report.

pbs,"Oct 31, 2017 9:38 AM EST",Trump dismisses former aide George Papadopoulos as ‘liar’," On Twitter, Trump sought to dismiss George Papadopoulos, who has provided key evidence in the first criminal case connecting Trump’s team to alleged intermediaries for Russia’s government. Said Trump: “Few people knew the young, low level volunteer named George, who has already proven to be a liar. Check the DEMS!” The Fake News is working overtime. As Paul Manaforts lawyer said, there was ""no collusion"" and events mentioned took place long before he… — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 31, 2017  ….came to the campaign. Few people knew the young, low level volunteer named George, who has already proven to be a liar. Check the DEMS! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 31, 2017  Papadopoulos was approached by people claiming ties to Russia and offering “dirt” on Hillary Clinton in the form of thousands of emails, according to court documents unsealed Monday. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents about the conversations and has been cooperating with investigators, the documents said. Papadopoulos’ guilty plea and the possibility that he’s working with Mueller’s team came as an unexpected twist in the mounting drama surrounding the criminal probe. A separate welter of charges Mueller announced Monday against Trump’s ex-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his longtime aide Rick Gates do not appear directly related to their work for Trump. But Papadopoulos’ case cuts close to the central question of Mueller’s investigation: Did Russia try to sway the election? Did Trump’s campaign know? “The Russians had emails of Clinton,” Papadopoulos was told by an unnamed professor with ties to Russia during a breakfast meeting at a London hotel in April. U.S. investigators said that the following day, Papadopoulos then emailed a Trump campaign policy adviser, “Have some interesting messages coming in from Moscow about a trip when the time is right.” Papadopoulos was arrested in July and has been interviewed repeatedly by authorities, the filing said. After entering his guilty plea he was ordered not to contact other Trump officials and prohibited from foreign travel. In one of the unsealed files, an FBI agent working for Mueller bluntly hinted that more former Trump associates could soon be questioned. Papadopoulos’ lawyer, Thomas M. Breen, based in Chicago, declined to comment on the guilty plea but noted that “we will have the opportunity to comment on George’s involvement when called upon by the court at a later date. We look forward to telling all of the details of George’s story at that time.” The incident echoes elements of a June 2016 meeting involving Donald Trump Jr. and other campaign officials at Trump Tower. The president’s son organized that sit down with a Russian lawyer who was offering negative information about Clinton.  President Trump and the conservative media are trying to shift the focus of the Russia probe toward two stories regarding Hillary Clinton and the funding behind the so-called “Russian dossier” and a 2010 Uranium deal with a Russian corporation. William Brangham puts the stories in context and looks at the truth behind the allegations. The White House immediately cast Papadopoulos as a mere volunteer with little influence during last year’s campaign. White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said his role was “extremely limited” and that “no activity was ever done in an official capacity on behalf of the campaign.” Trump named Papadopoulos to his foreign policy advisory council in March 2016, among a short list of experts amid growing public pressure on Trump to demonstrate he had a bench of foreign policy expertise. During a March 21, 2016 meeting with The Washington Post editorial board, Trump called Papadopoulos an “excellent guy.” Shortly afterward, Trump tweeted a photo of his advisory council meeting, with Papadopoulos among a handful of advisers at the president’s table. In his plea filing, Papadopolous admitted that he told Trump and other top campaign national security officials during that meeting, that he had made contact with intermediaries for Russia who said they could set up a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The court filings recount Papadopoulos’ meetings abroad starting in March 2016, after he’d been named to Trump’s board. Papadopoulos initially told the investigators the meetings came before, and later admitted that was untrue. Papadopoulos also deleted a Facebook post about his travels, the documents said. The court filings say he met first with the unnamed professor who boasted of damaging emails and then later with an unnamed Russian woman, who claimed to be related to Putin and sought to arrange a meeting between Trump and the Russian leader. The professor also introduced Papadopoulos to a third unnamed person who claimed he had connections to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The two men then exchanged emails about a possible meeting between Trump campaign aides and Russian government officials. The court records didn’t specify which emails the Russian claimed to have. The timing of the new disclosures about Clinton emails may be significant because the scope of the Kremlin’s efforts to hack Clinton’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee were just beginning to be understood by March 2016, weeks before Papadopoulos was told of damaging emails. It’s unclear how frequently Papadopoulos was in contact with the campaign officials. Sanders initially said the foreign policy advisory board convened only once, but the White House later clarified she was speaking only of official meetings with Trump in attendance. An official involved with the group said the group met on a monthly basis throughout the spring and summer for a total of about six meetings. Associated Press writer Tom LoBianco contributed to this report. WATCH: The charges against Manafort, Gates and Papadopoulos, explained by veteran prosecutors Left:

pbs,"Oct 31, 2017 9:13 AM EST",Russia says they do ‘not see anything illegal’ after Mueller indictments," Court papers unsealed on Monday revealed that George Papadopoulos who worked on the Trump campaign had reached out to a Russian he believed to have links to the Russian foreign ministry to arrange a meeting between the Trump team and Russian officials. The Russian International Relations Council has confirmed contact with Papadopoulos, but said a meeting never took place. The council insisted that it was an independent advisory body and that it hosts many politicians at various public meetings. Asked about the man mentioned in the indictment, Lavrov told reporters on Tuesday that he “does not see anything illegal” in the interaction.

It is not clear what Podesta’s firm knew about Manafort’s ultimate client or the extent of his involvement when it performed lobbying work on behalf of the European Center for a Modern Ukraine between 2012 and 2014.

                                    — Updated on Oct 31, 2017 7:30 PM EST","WATCH: Facebook, Twitter, Google testify in Senate hearing on Russia"," Colin Stretch and Sean Edgett, the general counsels for Facebook and Twitter, and Richard Salgado, Google’s director of law enforcement and information security, made their first appearances Tuesday in a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing about Russia’s attempts to spread disinformation online, along with how tech companies can help fight “fake news” and other extremist content in the future. Read the latest from the hearing here. Throughout the week, the representatives are expected to face questions about the ways hackers and other influencers associated with Russia may have disseminated fake news, created false accounts and otherwise used online platforms in an effort to manipulate the race between President Donald Trump and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton — including what the tech giants knew about infiltrations of their systems, and when. The subcommittee will also hear Tuesday from terrorism analyst Michael S. Smith and Clint Watts of the foreign policy research institute. READ MORE: A lot happened in the Russia investigation today. Here’s what you need to know The Washington Post reported late Monday that Google planned to tell senators that Russian trolls “uploaded over a thousand videos to YouTube on 18 different channels.” The Post and Bloomberg also reported, based on a review of draft testimony from the companies, that content produced by Russian operatives may have reached as many as 126 million Facebook users, though company executives said many of those users were not likely to see the content. In the months leading up to this week’s hearings, the companies have revealed more about how Russian-linked companies used their platforms. Facebook reported earlier this month that 10 million users were exposed to 3,000 ads purchased by a Russian troll farm during the presidential campaigns. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told Politico last week that he would likely raise proposed legislation that “would mandate new transparency for online political advertising” during Tuesday’s hearing. Facebook and Twitter have both said they will be more transparent about political ads on their platform, including providing more information about who is funding them.

pbs,N/A,Where is Mueller’s probe headed? Indictments and surprise plea agreement offer clues," The Russia investigation entered a new phase Monday with indictments for former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his deputy Rick Gates, and news of a guilty plea from a former Trump advisor for lying to the FBI about his connections to Russia. Lisa Desjardins reports and Judy Woodruff gets a breakdown of today’s indictments from Carrie Johnson of NPR. Judy Woodruff: The first charges in the Russia investigation speak to the size and scope of special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into Moscow’s meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Lisa Desjardins begins our coverage. Lisa Desjardins: Today, indictments for former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his deputy Rick Gates for charges unrelated to the campaign, and a guilty plea from former Trump adviser George Papadopoulos, which is related to campaign work. First, Manafort and Gates. Both pleaded not guilty today in court. Kevin Downing: There is no evidence that Mr. Manafort or the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government. Lisa Desjardins: The charges include laundering millions of dollars, tax fraud, failing to register as foreign agents and conspiracy against the United States, all of that stemming from their work consulting for foreign politicians for the last decade. Manafort, of course, is best known for his three months as the campaign chairman for Donald Trump. Paul Manafort We presented the exact messaging we were trying to do. Lisa Desjardins: Those were pivotal months. Manafort helped steer Trump’s primary wins, the selection of Mike Pence as vice president, and he oversaw last summer’s convention. Manafort was forced out shortly after that convention, following the release of a Ukrainian ledger alleging millions of dollars in payments to Manafort. Manafort called the document a fake and insisted no wrongdoing. Months later, the then White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer tried to downplay Manafort’s role. Sean Spicer: Obviously, there’s been this discussion of Paul Manafort, who played a very limited role for a very limited amount of time. Lisa Desjardins: PolitiFact found that statement to be false. President Trump defended Manafort in August. President Donald Trump: I have always found Paul Manafort to be a very decent man. Lisa Desjardins: Manafort is a longtime political operative, advising Ronald Reagan in 1980 and three other GOP nominees. He also made millions consulting overseas, including Ukraine, and for Ukrainian leader Viktor Yanukovych. Manafort is credited with his political makeover. As president of Ukraine in 2014, Yanukovych’s pro-Russian moves led to unrest, and he is now in exile in Russia. In 2015, Manafort bought an apartment in Trump Tower. A year later, he was working for the Trump campaign. Republican leaders like House Speaker Paul Ryan today acknowledged, but de-emphasized the charges. Rep. Paul Ryan: I have nothing to add to these indictments, other than this is what Bob Mueller was tasked to do. I haven’t read the indictments. I don’t know the specific details of the indictments. But that is how our — that’s how the judicial process works. Lisa Desjardins: Rick Gates is Manafort’s longtime number two. I need to mention here that I have personally known Gates since we were students in college together. Now, the indictments today allege that both Manafort and Gates hid and laundered millions coming in from overseas to avoid taxes and that they acted as agents of foreign governments and did not disclose that. Also today, Democratic lobbyist Tony Podesta resigned from his namesake firm, following news that his ties to Manafort, and his work on Ukraine issues, are also under investigation. A potentially more revealing case involves George Papadopoulos, who now appears to be a cooperating witness in the investigation. He was a Trump campaign foreign policy adviser. In papers unsealed today, Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with three people who were Russian or connected to Russia. The plea lists pages of contacts while he in the campaign, some about possible Russian dirt on Hillary Clinton and many about setting up direct meetings between Russian officials and Trump. In the plea, Papadopoulos said he brought up that idea to then candidate Trump and others at a march 2016 meeting. That’s shown in a photo tweeted out by Trump himself. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders responded today. Sarah Sanders: I’m not sure that the president recalls specific details of the meeting. Again, it was a brief meeting that took place quite some time ago. It was the one time that group ever met. Lisa Desjardins: As for Papadopoulos’s role? Sarah Sanders: It was extremely limited It was a volunteer position. And, again, no activity was ever done in an official capacity on behalf of the campaign. Lisa Desjardins: Sanders insisted none of this is related to the president at all. The president responded himself on Twitter, writing that the events involving Manafort were years ago and that there is no collusion. We know this: Special counsel Mueller’s team has entered its next high-stakes phase of investigation, with the endgame still unclear. For the PBS NewsHour, I’m Lisa Desjardins. Judy Woodruff: And now let’s look further into what is clear from today’s indictments with Carrie Johnson. She’s justice correspondent for NPR. Carrie, thank you for talking with us. You have been watching what Robert Mueller has been doing, at least as closely as a journalist can. What have we learned today about his work from these indictments? Carrie Johnson: That he’s working slowly, methodically and, in fact, five months in, he now has charged three people with wrongdoing. One of them, George Papadopoulos, has agreed to cooperate and has already been meeting with government investigators to tell them what he knows. For the last several months, Robert Mueller has been able to keep that a secret from members of the press and the Trump campaign and the White House. Also today, the charges against Paul Manafort and his right-hand man, Rick Gates, really upped the ante against Manafort. We know that Mueller has been putting pressure on Manafort at least since July, when the FBI raided his residence in Virginia. This may afford Manafort one last chance to cooperate and agree to help the Mueller investigate. If not, he faces many, many years in prison on those conspiracy charges and charges that he failed to register as a foreign agent. Mueller’s lawyer today said he didn’t engage in any wrongdoing. Judy Woodruff: So, Carrie, is… Carrie Johnson: I mean, Manafort’s lawyer today said he didn’t engage in any wrongdoing. Judy Woodruff: I’m sorry to interrupt you. So, Carrie, among those reporters who follow or try to follow what Robert Mueller is up to, was this expected, or was it a surprise? Carrie Johnson: It was a bit of legal shock and awe, Judy, because, while Paul Manafort had been under the sights of the special counsel for some weeks now, and Rick Gates, as Mueller’s right-hand man, was as well, this guilty plea involving George Papadopoulos, a little-known 30-year-old foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign, had flown completely under the radar. In fact, Papadopoulos had met with the FBI on a couple of occasions this year. He was actually arrested at Dulles Airport in July, and no word of that leaked until today. He’s been telling the FBI what he knows. And I don’t think we know exactly from these charging documents absolutely everything he has told the special counsel. I think there are a lot of investigative avenues opening up today that we didn’t know about before. Judy Woodruff: So, is there a sense, Carrie, from looking at this, of where Mueller depends to go from here, or are more surprises in store? Carrie Johnson: Well, I think more surprise may be in store, but there are some clues from the charging documents. One is that both Paul Manafort and Rick Gates were charged with failing to file as foreign agents operating inside the U.S. That charge has been little used, in fact, Manafort’s lawyer said used only six times since 1966. And that is the charge that could be deployed against other members of the Trump campaign. Remember, former General Mike Flynn, also Trump’s former national security adviser, belatedly filed foreign agent papers earlier this year. Secondly, the Papadopoulos charging documents reference conversations he had with supervisors in the campaign, high-ranking people involved in the Trump campaign last year. And investigators are looking at what those people knew and whether they can come under some kind of scrutiny from the FBI and the special counsel team moving forward. Judy Woodruff: And, Carrie, we heard the White House spokeswoman say today that it’s their information that the Mueller investigation is going to be wrapping up pretty soon. Any idea where that’s coming from and if that is accurate? Carrie Johnson: I have heard the White House press secretary say that. I have also heard Ty Cobb, who is a special counsel with the president dealing with and managing cooperation with the special counsel. Judy, as somebody who’s been doing this a long time, I see no evidence that this investigation is going to end before the end of this year. And, certainly, it feels as if it might go well into next year. At this point, Paul Manafort and Rick Gates are contesting the charges against them and, it could be presumed, preparing for trial, which wouldn’t happen until mid-2018 at the earliest. This could be a cloud hanging over the Trump White House for many months to come. Judy Woodruff: Carrie Johnson, justice correspondent for NPR, we thank you. Carrie Johnson: Thank you.

pbs,N/A,"The charges against Manafort, Gates and Papadopoulos, explained by veteran prosecutors"," Money laundering, tax fraud and lying to the FBI are some of the charges revealed Monday as part of Robert Mueller's probe. Two former federal prosecutors experienced in handling high-stakes investigations -- Peter Zeidenberg and former Justice Department official John Carlin -- join Judy Woodruff to offer a deeper look at the legal details and what they mean going forward. Judy Woodruff: And now a deeper look at the legal details here with two former federal prosecutors experienced in handling high-stakes investigations and prosecutions. John Carlin ran the Justice Department’s National Security Division from 2013 to 2016. Before that, he served as chief of staff and senior counsel to then FBI Director Robert Mueller. And Peter Zeidenberg, whose 17 years as a federal prosecutor included time as deputy special counsel in the investigation into the leak of CIA officer Valerie Plame’s identity. Gentlemen, welcome back to the NewsHour to both of you. John Carlin, to start with you, what’s most significant about today’s indictments? John Carlin: Well, there are two things that happened today. We have the indictments and then we have the release of a plea agreement and the statement of offense. And taking each in turn, so the indictment, what we see today, at least according to the allegations, is that the campaign manager of a major candidate who is now president was secretly taking millions and millions of dollars from the Ukrainian government that was one of Putin’s Russia’s closest allies. And just to explain who — for your viewers, who Yanukovych is, this is someone who not only was so close to Russia that, when he was deposed, he fled there in 2014. Judy Woodruff: Right. John Carlin: But it was him being overthrown that caused Putin’s Russia to invade and seize part of the Ukraine that led to the still-in-effect sanctions. So — and that’s a significance there. With Papadopoulos and the plea agreement today, we now know that there is an individual who has been cooperating for months, and that there is someone who was on the campaign, and, while he was on the campaign, was talking to people he knew were in touch with Russian officials to get damaging information about the opposing campaign, including hearing all the way back on April 26, according to the statement of offense, of 2016 that they had thousands of e-mails from Clinton’s campaign. Judy Woodruff: So, Peter Zeidenberg, you have had a chance to look at these plea agreements and also the — I’m sorry — the plea agreement and the indictments. What do they say to you? Peter Zeidenberg: Well, it says to me they have got a big problem at the White House. The Papadopoulos plea agreement suggests that there are at least three individuals that were involved with the campaign that were fully aware of Mr. Papadopoulos’ connection with Russia, and he was advising — he sent an e-mail saying Russia updates. And this is after the campaign and the administration has been saying for many, many months no connection with Russia, no collusion, no cooperation, no connection of any kind. And now we know that at least three people besides Papadopoulos were aware that he was trying to reach out and, in fact, had reached out to Russian government officials. Judy Woodruff: And the White House — and more to talk about here, but I was struck that the White House today was emphatic, John Carlin, in saying, well, but this happened, in terms of what Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates did, well before the Trump campaign, didn’t have anything to do with what the Trump campaign was doing. John Carlin: I will just say, according to the document that we have seen today, that while he was the campaign manager for the Trump campaign — the whole point of the statute that these allegations say that Manafort violated and his aide, the Foreign Agent Registration Act, is to be transparent when you’re receiving money from a foreign government… Judy Woodruff: Right. John Carlin: … so if you’re acting on their behalf, the American people know. And the problem here is that he wasn’t. He wasn’t transparent. And so, in that sense, it’s a big deal. Judy Woodruff: And we heard his lawyer — we heard Paul Manafort’s lawyer, Peter Zeidenberg, say, well, this has only been used, I think he said, a handful of times in the last many, many decades, and only once successfully. Peter Zeidenberg: That is true. It’s a rarely used statute. But, man, if you’re going to use it, this is the case to use it for. Here, you have got an enormous amount of money from a country that is trying to influence our election. I mean, this is like a paradigm of why the statute is written, so that if you were going to bring a case, this is the case to bring. Judy Woodruff: So, let’s come back to George Papadopoulos and that plea agreement, John Carlin. Again, going to the White House’s reaction, they said, well, this is somebody with an extremely limited role, he wanted to do things for the campaign, he kept being turned away. So, they’re trying to — I mean, they’re putting as much distance as they can between the campaign and anything he did. John Carlin: Well, and not commenting on the White House, but looking at the statement of the offense, it wasn’t just that Papadopoulos, while working as a member of the national security team — and the statement of offense takes pains to point out that he attended a meeting with the president of the United States while working on the campaign in March of that year. But it’s also he was reporting what he was doing back up to campaign officials, as Peter points out, at least three officials. They are not named, but it says they were campaign officials, and he’s e-mailing them while he’s talking to these representatives of the Russian government. So there is definitely more to find out there. Judy Woodruff: So, what does that tell us, Peter Zeidenberg? Are we closer to knowing whether there was collusion? And remind everybody what it would mean the to prove collusion, coordination between a campaign… Peter Zeidenberg: Well, there’s no legal term of art for collusion. The crime, if there was one, would be conspiracy. And this has all the hallmarks of a conspiracy. It’s not charged as a conspiracy, but it certainly wouldn’t be a stretch to say that there is coordination and a goal of getting this information to the campaign. He was encouraged by one of these officials to take the meeting in Moscow. And he’d explained that… Judy Woodruff: One of the campaign officials. Peter Zeidenberg: On the — by the campaign officials. So, the dots are all lined up. All you got to do is take the pencil and draw the line. Judy Woodruff: What does this say to you, John Carlin, about how — I mean, we’re not able to talk to Robert Mueller. I mean, he’s been operating very much behind closed doors. But what does it say to you about his approach to what he has and what he may have going forward? John Carlin: Well, I think the one thing that’s clear, as we knew, is that he was going to take the facts where they led, and if anyone could act quickly and assemble a team and bring charges quickly, it’s him. These are serious charges. It’s actually a relatively short period of time to bring as substantive an indictment as you see. And when you have someone who’s pled guilty and continuing to cooperate, you can tell there’s more work to do on the investigation. But one point I don’t think should be lost is just — we talked about where it might go, but to just take a step as to where we are, before we start changing our expectations as to what’s normal and what is not. This is more information of historic importance that we just haven’t seen before about a Russian campaign, and here another government as well, that ends up influencing our presidential election, our core of what it is to be a democratic country. And that’s not partisan. That’s a problem that needs to be addressed across party lines. Judy Woodruff: And, Peter Zeidenberg, what do you say to those listening and watching out there who maybe saying, well, it’s just an indictment, it’s just a charge, none of this has been proven? Peter Zeidenberg: Actually, Papadopoulos is not just a charge. He’s pled guilty and will be cooperating. And it sounds like these are — you know, there’s an e-mail trail that goes on. And I guarantee you that the three campaign advisers have been interviewed. And they may be cooperating as well. They may have corroborated this as well. And if they contradicted it, they either may have — they either will be charged or may already have been charged. So, there are a lot more shoes to drop here, for sure. Judy Woodruff: Peter Zeidenberg, John Carlin, just the beginning. Thank you both very much. John Carlin: Thank you. Peter Zeidenberg: Thank you.

pbs,N/A,Trump says Clinton should be the focus of the Russia probe. Here are the facts behind those stories," As the Russia probe continues, President Trump and conservative media outlets are promoting two stories about Hillary Clinton that they say should be the real focus of an investigation. But what’s the truth behind those allegations? Our William Brangham is here to put them in context. President Donald Trump: And you look at what’s happened with Russia and you look at the uranium deal and you look at the fake dossier. Sean Hannity: With Uranium One, the FBI had mountains of evidence of Russian bribery. Judge Jeanine: The Clinton campaign and the DNC paid $12 million for a dossier to connect Donald Trump to Russia. William Brangham: The president and much of the conservative media are arguing that these two stories about the infamous Russian dossier and the so-called Uranium One deal are evidence that not only is the Russia story a hoax, but that Hillary Clinton should be investigated, not President Trump. First, the dossier. The so-called Russian dossier was compiled by this man, former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele. He got his information from various Russian contacts, some of whom he paid for their info. Steele was working at the time for a company called Fusion GPS. In January, BuzzFeed News released a copy of the dossier. It contained as yet unproven allegations that the Russians had wanted Mr. Trump to win the election, that Russians had shared valuable information about Hillary Clinton with the Trump campaign, and that Russia had compromising sexually explicit video of Mr. Trump that could be used as blackmail. The conservative news site The Free Beacon initially paid Fusion GPS to gather material against Mr. Trump. It was gathered for Marco Rubio’s presidential campaign because The Beacon’s largest funder was a big Rubio supporter. That funding stopped when Mr. Trump clinched the Republican presidential nomination. After that point, Marc Elias, Elias, a top lawyer for the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign, continued paying Fusion GPS, and that’s when the Steele dossier was compiled. It’s these payments that the White House says proves the Clinton campaign was behind the whole Russia story. They seem to be arguing that, because Christopher Steele got his information from Russian sources, that means the Clinton campaign was colluding with the Russians and creating this false narrative. Here’s how White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders put it today: Sarah Sanders: There’s clear evidence of the Clinton campaign colluding with Russian intelligence to spread disinformation and smear the President to influence the election. William Brangham: The White House’s theory ignores the broad consensus shared by U.S. intelligence agencies that the Russians did try and influence our elections, in part by hacking e-mails from the DNC and Clinton campaign chair John Podesta. The second story is about the so-called Uranium One deal, which President Trump has called this era’s Watergate. It dates back to 2010 and the sale of a controlling interest in a company called Uranium One. It’s a Canadian mining company that partly operates in the United States, and it was sold to a state-owned Russian corporation, Rosatom. The sale involved control of about 20 percent of the United States’ uranium reserves, and the sale required a review by the U.S. government. The claim is that Hillary Clinton, who was secretary of state at the time, approved the sale in exchange for $145 million in contributions to the Clinton Global Initiative. President Donald Trump: Hillary Clinton gave them 20 percent of our uranium, gave Russia, for a big payment. William Brangham: So, let’s break this down. First, Secretary Clinton didn’t have the authority to approve the deal. Several different U.S. agencies had to sign off on the deal, all of which did. There is no evidence that Clinton was informed or involved in the sale at all. Second, the uranium never left the country. It’s not legal to export uranium produced in U.S. mines. The Clinton Foundation did receive $145 million in contributions from individuals connected to Uranium One, beginning at least a year before the sale. And, in 2010, the year of the sale, former President Bill Clinton received $500,000 from a Russian bank for a speech he gave in Moscow. For now, those all have been deemed legal transactions. But, still, today, Mr. Trump once again stoked these stories on Twitter, suggesting now that even the Obama campaign might have been in on creating the dossier. And on Capitol Hill, congressional Republicans continue their calls to investigate the Clinton campaign. For the PBS NewsHour, I’m William Brangham.

pbs,N/A,Do Mueller’s first indictments change anything politically?," And for more on the political fallout from today’s developments, we are joined by our Politics Monday team, Tamara Keith of NPR and Amy Walter of The Cook Political Report. Politics Monday. Good to see both of you. I want to ask you about William Brangham’s reporting. But, Tam, let’s start with these — the news today, and that is the two indictments and then the plea agreement. Is there a sense from the White House, from the Hill, from Capitol Hill that this is a big moment politically, or just another day in the life of this ongoing investigation? Tamara Keith: The White House is treating this sort of like they have treated other big revelations, saying, oh, this Papadopoulos guy, he was just a volunteer for the campaign, and, hey, look, those charges that they announced, that he just pled out to misleading the FBI, that doesn’t have anything to do with the campaign. Of course, as the legal experts you have had on made very clear, he — that means he’s cooperating. And they’re — in these documents, there were all kinds of connections, e-mails, various documentation of him clueing in top leadership at the Trump campaign. As for the Hill, Republicans have been relatively quiet. Paul Ryan early in the day said something like he’s not going to let this thing get in the way of doing the work for the American people, taxes. And there were a couple of Republicans late in the day who said that Mueller should be allowed to continue to have this process carry out. Judy Woodruff: So, saying he should go ahead. And, Amy, we were just talking about this. It was Senator Grassley and Senator Hatch, senior Republicans, saying the judicial process should move forward. Amy Walter: Right, and I think laying down a marker early on to say, if there is any indication that the president is going to try to dismiss Mueller or to try to dismiss these allegations, we’re letting everybody know that’s not OK. They didn’t come right out and say that, but it seems it’s pretty clear they’re laying the parameters here for — to tell the president, this has to keep going, do not try to short-circuit this. Tamara Keith: And the White House did say that President Trump is not considering getting rid of Mueller. Judy Woodruff: That’s right, which — and there was a lot of speculation about that. But, Amy, does it feel like we have turned some kind of political corner here? We have been talking about the Mueller investigation, the Mueller investigation. Amy Walter: I know. Judy Woodruff: Now we see real evidence, tangible evidence of what he may have. Does it change things? Amy Walter: Look, that’s a really good question. And I guess we have to start with, in what context? So, the first is, does it change things, as we talked about, on Capitol Hill? Does it derail the Republicans’ agenda and the president’s agenda? They are moving full-steam ahead on taxes. As we discussed, they already have a lot of other — we discussed this, I guess, last week — they have a lot of other challenges in getting a tax bill going forward. But is this going to derail them even farther? They are going to have to spend more time answering questions about this. The president will be distracted, not a strong and effective spokesperson if he’s tweeting about Russia, instead of focusing on taxes, is number one. And the second, does it move voters? Like so much else in this country, Judy, people are really polarized on this question about Russia and its interference. There is one group of people convinced that, no matter what, there was collusion with Trump and Russians. One group of people believe this is all basically fake and there’s no there there. And then there’s a big group in the middle that says, I don’t know what to believe. I’m not really paying much attention. What we’re going to have to watch for in these next few weeks is whether those two groups, the groups that believe there is nothing there, or I don’t really care because I’m not really paying attention to it, is there anything that they have seen that actually moves them? And it’s really too soon to tell. The one thing that’s important, though, Judy, is that this week, before we even started with these indictments, the president was already in a deep hole politically. The Wall Street Journal/NBC poll came out this weekend, the president at 38 percent approval rating. This is the lowest of his presidency. In fact, in all NBC/Wall Street Journal polling, this is the lowest of a presidency in his presidency in his first term. So, he’s already starting at a very low point. Having your campaign officials indicted isn’t going to make it that much better. Judy Woodruff: And yet, Tamara, Tam, when you talk to Republicans, they point out, well, but he’s still doing well among Republican voters, and that’s what Republican members of Congress who want to be reelected are focused on. Tamara Keith: Well, and the other thing they’re focused on is getting this tax system overhaul done. Judy Woodruff: Right. Tamara Keith: Because they feel that is — that’s existential at this point, it’s life and death. If they can’t do that, then many of them feel that their chances of getting reelected are even worse, their chances of holding onto the House and holding onto the Senate. And President Trump may have people that are associated with his campaign and people with close ties to him who have some legal problems and all of those things. President Trump is still a man with a pen who can sign a tax overhaul if one gets to his desk. Amy Walter: Well, and we don’t know when and if other indictments are going to come down. We’re pointing to this day as, was this a turning point? But you just don’t know at any day whether something else is going to — when another shoe or another thing is going to drop. It makes it really difficult if you’re a political strategist, if you’re a legislative person on the Hill, to try to map out anything, even week by week, nonetheless for a couple months going out. Judy Woodruff: And, meantime, as we just heard from William Brangham, the White House, the press secretary at the White House continue to push forward — the president himself with his tweets, Tam, continues to push forward this idea that no, no, no, the investigation should be focusing on Hillary Clinton, the uranium deal and other conspiracies. Tamara Keith: Right. And the press secretary, Sarah Sanders, saying that the real collusion, look at the real collusion, it’s Hillary Clinton and the dossier, which is an interesting argument and one that gained a lot of steam last week, right before the news broke that there were going to be indictments. Amy Walter: And what we have learned too about the Republican base is they may not all be completely unified around the president or the president’s agenda, but the one thing that unifies them more than anything else, Hillary Clinton. Bring up Hillary Clinton’s name, you are going to get the base coming around to support that contention. It worked in the 2016 campaign. It’s not clear that it’s going to work here. And, again, for those people in the middle who aren’t paying as much attention, maybe don’t know what to think, is that really going to cloud it enough for them that they’re not going to… Judy Woodruff: That’s the question, because there’s no one singular name that’s going to be on the ballot in all these congressional elections, either in the Virginia governor’s race, which we need to talk about next week — we will talk about next week — or in these races next year, Tam. Tamara Keith: Yes, that’s it. Amy Walter: And that, if anything, what it does is, it impacts enthusiasm from the Republican base. If they feel disillusioned, dispirited, they may not believe that the president has necessarily done anything wrong, but they’re not feeling as energized about coming out to vote and support Republicans. Judy Woodruff: An energized Amy Walter, an energized Tamara Keith, thank you both. (LAUGHTER) Judy Woodruff: Politics Monday. Amy Walter: You’re welcome. Tamara Keith: You’re welcome.

pbs,"Oct 30, 2017 4:22 PM EST","Analysis: Your guide to the Supreme Court, and what to watch"," First, let’s catch up a bit. The new term began on the traditional first Monday in October—Oct. 2 to be exact. That day also marked the beginning of the October argument session, a two-week period in which the justices sit on the bench to hear cases they’ve agreed to consider. There is a rhythm to the life of the Supreme Court which is rarely interrupted, not even by government shutdowns or blizzards. How to follow the Supreme Court The justices hear arguments two weeks of each month from October through April, and from Mondays through Wednesdays during those two-week sessions. The argument calendar is posted on the court’s website at www.supremecourt.gov. The briefs that have been filed in the cases that will be argued can also be found on the court’s website, beginning Nov. 13. An argument session is the best time to visit the court to get a sense of its work and the justices’ personalities. But if you can’t get to the court to hear the arguments, transcripts are posted on the court website on the afternoon of the argument day, and both the transcripts and the audio are available on the website on Friday of each argument week. The justices generally meet in a private conference each week to vote on argued cases and to review new petitions that they may add to their argument calendar. May and June are “quiet” months in which the justices write and issue the bulk of the term’s decisions. Three cases to watch Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg predicted the “momentous” term because of some of the issues raised in cases that the justices will decide. Two of those cases were in the court’s October argument session and appeared to divide the justices. First, the business community has been very successful in winning court approval—and just last week congressional approval– of arbitration agreements prohibiting consumers from banding together in class actions over their grievances. Business’ efforts now are directed at winning the same prohibition in employee contracts. Some 25 million employees have contracts with mandatory arbitration agreements banning class actions. The National Labor Relations Board told the justices that those bans violate federal labor law. Business and the Trump Administration—in a switch from the Obama Administration’s position– argued that the bans must be enforced under the Federal Arbitration Act. And the second case to watch closely from October’s argument session is the partisan gerrymandering challenge from Wisconsin. The political stakes for both parties and for voters are enormous.  The justices are asked to decide when the redrawing of legislative or congressional district lines are so infected with partisanship that it violates the Constitution. Just how to measure too much partisanship is the challenge facing the Supreme Court. Now on to November’s arguments and beyond. The two-week November argument session begins Oct. 30, and, to be frank, the arguments are, well, pretty wonky—with one exception. The exception–wonky, but important– asks when does Congress cross a constitutional line by directing the outcome of a court case through legislation? David Patchak of Michigan argues that Congress violated the Constitution’s separation of powers when it passed a law requiring courts to dismiss any lawsuit challenging the Department of Interior’s decision to take a tract of land into trust for the Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Band of Indians. Patchak, who lives near the land, had filed a suit challenging the tribe’s plans to construct a casino and entertainment facility on the trust property. His case reached the Supreme Court in 2012 but only on the issue of whether his suit could go forward. The justices said yes, but after that ruling, Congress enacted the law removing jurisdiction from the federal courts over any actions relating to the property. Patchak v. Zinke will be heard on Nov. 11. Separation-of-powers issues go to the fundamental structure of our Constitution. And these challenges offer a window into how the justices view their own role and roles of the other branches. Four critical lawsuits Now about that “legal tsunami.” In one remarkable week in October, our federal courts were busy with four critical lawsuits against President Donald Trump and Trump Administration policies. They heard arguments on whether the administration could end insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act and could penalize so-called sanctuary cities and counties that refuse to fully cooperate in enforcing federal immigration laws; whether the administration’s latest “travel ban” violates immigration law and the Constitution, and whether the president has violated the Constitution’s emoluments clause which bars federal officials from receiving benefits from foreign governments.

pbs,"Oct 30, 2017 3:11 PM EST",A lot happened in the Russia investigation yesterday. Here’s what you need to know," What are the charges against Manafort and Gates? Manafort and Gates were indicted on 12 counts, including money laundering, acting as unregistered foreign agents, and making false statements to federal authorities. The 31-page indictment, which was unsealed Monday, also included several charges connected to hiding foreign bank accounts and financial information. How are Manafort and Gates linked to Ukraine? The indictments shed light on Manafort’s past business activities, in particular his and Gates’ lobbying work for the Ukrainian government and former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. Yanukovych, a Kremlin ally, faced accusations of corruption during his presidency and criticism for the deaths of dozens of protesters in 2013. Yanukovych fled Ukraine in 2014 and is living in exile in Russia. According to the indictment, Manafort and Gates lobbied United States officials on behalf of the Ukrainian government, Yanukovych and political parties in Ukraine from “at least” 2005 to 2016. During that time, Manafort and Gates did not register as foreign agents with the U.S., in violation of federal law. Manafort and Gates “generated tens of millions of dollars in income as a result of their Ukraine work,” the indictment reads, and “laundered the money through scores of United States and foreign corporations, partnerships and bank accounts.” Manafort alone laundered more than $18 million, the indictment reads, and “used his hidden overseas wealth to enjoy a lavish lifestyle in the United States.” Manafort’s long career in politics and lobbying Manafort’s career as a Republican political consultant goes back years. He helped former President Gerald Ford’s campaign manage the 1976 Republican National Convention. He also worked on the presidential campaigns of Ronald Reagan in 1980, George H. W. Bush in 1988, and Bob Dole in 1996. Manafort, 68, is also a longtime lobbyist with deep ties in Washington. He helped form the lobbying firm Black, Manafort &amp; Stone in 1980 (it later merged with another firm and was renamed), and has worked as a lobbyist for the past several decades. Manafort joined Trump’s campaign in early 2016 and was hired as campaign chairman in June 2016, after Trump fired then-campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. At the time, Manafort was viewed as a veteran political operative who could help bring discipline to Trump’s outsider campaign, and navigate the complexities of a brokered convention in the event that Trump failed to clinch the GOP nomination by the end of the primaries. But Manafort became a major distraction for the campaign two months later after news broke of his business dealings in Ukraine. He resigned from the campaign in August 2016, and Trump replaced him with Stephen Bannon, who steered the campaign — with Kellyanne Conway’s help — through Trump’s victory on Election Day. Who is Rick Gates? Gates has worked with Manafort for more than a decade. According to ABC, their relationship dates back to 2005, when they worked together at Davis Manafort Inc., a political consulting firm led by Manafort and Rick Davis, another political consultant. Gates later worked for Manafort’s international consulting firm. He joined the Trump campaign along with Manafort in 2016, but stayed on after Manafort was ousted. Gates helped manage the GOP convention, eventually rising to become a senior adviser on the campaign. Gates was also a top official for Trump’s inauguration committee. How does George Papadopoulos fit into this? In addition to the indictments against Manafort and Gates, prosecutors also released a separate document Monday revealing that a former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser lied about his contacts with Russia. The former aide, George Papadopoulos, admitted earlier this year that he communicated with two people he thought were connected to the Kremlin as part of an effort to get information about Hillary Clinton. Papadopoulos was arrested earlier this year and has since reached a plea deal. What do these indictments mean for the Trump-Russia campaign? The charges Monday focused on Manafort and Gates’ activity and were not related to Trump, his campaign or its possible ties to Russia. But the indictments were a major step in Mueller’s probe into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 race and potential collusion with Trump’s campaign, and a sign of the investigation’s broad scope. The probe has been a distraction for the president and the Republican-controlled Congress, which has struggled to enact Trump’s agenda. White House reaction Trump responded to the indictment on Twitter, saying it proved there was no collusion between Russia and his campaign. “Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign. But why aren’t Crooked Hillary &amp; the Dems the focus?????” Trump tweeted. In a second post, he wrote: “….Also, there is NO COLLUSION!” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters the indictment was unrelated to the campaign and also distanced the campaign from Papadopoulos, saying he held a “volunteer” position with Trump’s team during the election. What’s next for Manafort and Gates? Both men appeared in court Monday and plead not guilty to all 12 counts. A bond of $10 million was set for Manafort; the bond for Gates was set at $5 million. Of the charges they face, money laundering is the most serious and could result in a potential prison term of up to 20 years, according to the New York Times. Left:

pbs,"Oct 30, 2017 2:22 PM EST",China wants U.S. to stay out of South China Sea talks," Ambassador Cui Tiankai said the U.S. has no territorial claim in those waters and should let countries in the region manage their disputes in a “friendly and effective way.” Beijing’s island-building in the South China Sea has drawn criticism from Washington which says it has a national interest in freedom of navigation in sea lanes critical for world trade. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson this month said China’s “provocative actions” challenge international law and norms. Efforts to forge a legally binding code of conduct between China and the diverse members of the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, have long been stymied by Beijing’s reluctance to negotiate with nations as a bloc and differences within ASEAN itself. Singapore’s prime minister last week said the negotiations were likely to take years. Cui implied that Washington was making that more difficult. “I think it would certainly be better if others including the United States would not try to interfere in this constructive process, would not try to create obstacles to early agreement on the (code of conduct),” he told reporters at the Chinese Embassy in Washington. “I think that this is our hope. This is also the hope of the ASEAN countries.” Cui was previewing China’s preparations for Trump’s five-nation trip to Asia that includes a state visit to China. He said it comes at a “very important moment” for relations between the two world powers — building on progress made when Chinese President Xi Jinping met Trump at his Florida resort in April. The ambassador said North Korea will be a priority in the talks. He warned that tensions over the North’s nuclear program could get more dangerous without more efforts to reach a negotiated solution. Asked whether comments from Trump — who has threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea if it attacks — were making worse, Cui urged all parties to “refrain from doing anything that might escalate the tension.” The ambassador predicted concrete results at the summit on economics and trade but didn’t say what they might be. Trump wants to narrow the gaping U.S. trade deficit with China — a goal Cui said China shares although he cautioned it would take time as it was a “structural” problem. He rejected U.S. accusations that China, the world’s second-largest economy and the largest in Asia, was engaged in “predatory” policies at the expense of its neighbors. Cui said those saying things about China, “might just look into the mirror and it might be describing themselves.” Associated Press writer Jill Colvin contributed to this report. Left:

pbs,"Oct 30, 2017 2:02 PM EST",National Park Service drops funding for Black Panther Party project," The park service had pledged $98,000 to the University of California, Berkeley for a two-year research project on the black power group, which was founded in Oakland in 1966. The Fraternal Order of Police sent a letter to Trump expressing “outrage and shock” that the park service would pay to honor a group associated with killing a park ranger. A party member was convicted of murdering Ranger Kenneth Patrick in 1973 while he was on patrol at a national seashore near San Francisco. Park service spokesman Jeremy Barnum said Monday that a “cooperative agreement” to fund the project was not finalized, and the agency withdrew funding “after an additional review of the project.” He declined further comment. Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., called withdrawal of the funding “outrageous.” The Black Panther Party was “an integral part of the civil rights movement and the public has a right to know their history,” Lee said. Lee, who represents Oakland, urged the park service and Interior Department to provide a full explanation of why funding for the project was dropped. The police group said in its Oct. 19 letter to Trump that “the only meaning” that the Black Panthers “brought to any lives was grief to the families of their victims.” The FOP said its research indicated that 16 law enforcement officers, including Patrick, were killed by Black Panther members. “Why would the NPS seek to commemorate the activities of an extremist separatist group that advocated the use of violence against our country — a country they perceived as their enemy?” the police group wrote. The Black Panthers formed in Oakland to defend African-Americans against police brutality and protect the rights of a downtrodden people to determine their own future. The party scared mainstream America with their calls for revolution that were at odds with Martin Luther King Jr.’s insistence on peaceful protest. After the group launched armed patrols, California lawmakers repealed a law that allowed people to carry loaded weapons in public. The Panthers gained national attention when they carried guns into the state Capitol in protest. The Panthers eventually imploded, weakened by internal fighting and by a government effort to undermine the group. Former FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover said the Black Panthers represented the nation’s “greatest threat to internal security.” The Nixon administration moved to shut the group down. Left:

pbs,"Oct 30, 2017 1:11 PM EST
                                    — Updated on Oct 30, 2017 2:40 PM EST",D.C. court bars Trump from reversing transgender troops policy," U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly ruled that transgender service members who had sued over Trump’s policy were likely to win their lawsuit. She directed a return to the situation that existed before Trump announced his new policy this summer. Trump had ordered a return to the policy in place before June 2016, under which transgender individuals were barred from joining the military and service members could be discharged for being transgender. Under President Barack Obama, that policy was changed to allow transgender service members. The Trump administration may appeal Kollar-Kotelly’s decision, but for now, the proposed ban remains unenforceable. “We are enormously relieved for our plaintiffs and other transgender service members,” said Shannon Minter of the National Center for Lesbian Rights, an attorney handling the lawsuit. “Their lives have been devastated since Trump first tweeted he was reinstating the ban,” Minter said. “They are now able to serve on equal terms with everyone else.” White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders, asked about the ruling at the White House briefing, said it was something that had just been announced and said the Justice Department was reviewing it. Trump announced on Twitter in July that the “the United States Government will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military.” He followed with an August memo directing the Pentagon to extend indefinitely a ban on transgender individuals joining the military, and gave Defense Secretary Jim Mattis six months to come up with a policy on “how to address” those who are currently serving. Under the Obama administration, the Department of Defense had announced in 2016 that service members could not be discharged solely based on their gender identity. Transgender individuals were to be allowed to enlist in the military effective Jan. 1, 2018. Minter said the new court ruling means they will be able to do that. The Trump administration had asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit; Kollar-Kotelly refused to do so Other lawsuits challenging president’s directive have been filed in Seattle and Baltimore. Crary reported from New York. READ MORE: Here’s what most people get wrong about the transgender community Left:

pbs,"Oct 30, 2017 11:40 AM EST",Ex-Trump aide George Papadopoulos pleads guilty in Russia probe," In documents provided by the office of special counsel Robert Mueller, the indictments revealed that George Papadopoulos, an early foreign policy adviser to candidate Trump’s 2016 campaign, pleaded guilty earlier this month to one count of lying to FBI agents about a connection to a Russian professor believed to have ties with top Russian government officials. According to court documents, the 30-year-old lower-level defendant made a false statement to the FBI in January, when he said that a conversation with the unnamed professor took place before he joined Trump’s campaign team as an adviser. “In truth and in fact, however, defendant Papadopoulos learned he would be an advisor to the Campaign in early March,” and met with the professor days after joining the presidential campaign, the court document said. The professor “only took interest in defendant Papadopoulos because of his status with the Campaign,” the documents added. The guilty plea, unsealed Monday, means that Papadopoulos is the first individual to face criminal charges in the ongoing investigations into Russia meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Left:

pbs,"Oct 30, 2017 11:40 AM EST","Trump responds to Manafort indictment, says Democrats should be focus of Russia probe"," Responding to news that two former senior campaign aides were charged by special counsel Robert Mueller, the president asked on Twitter why “Crooked Hillary &amp; Dems” aren’t the focus of the probe. His Twitter response marked the first official comment by the White House on the news that Manafort and Rick Gates turned themselves into federal authorities in the first arrests in Mueller’s probe into Russian involvement in the 2016 election. The indictment against Manafort and Gates alleges criminal activity through “at least 2016.” Over the weekend, Trump took to Twitter to allege that the “facts are pouring out” about links to Russia by his former presidential opponent, Hillary Clinton. “DO SOMETHING!” Trump urged in one of five morning tweets. Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign. But why aren't Crooked Hillary &amp; the Dems the focus????? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 30, 2017  ….Also, there is NO COLLUSION! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 30, 2017  Trump’s tweets followed news reports late Friday that a federal grand jury in Washington has approved the first charges in a criminal investigation into Russia ties led by special counsel Robert Mueller. Ty Cobb, a member of Trump’s legal team, said the president was not referring to CNN’s reporting. “Contrary to what many have suggested, the president’s comments today are unrelated to the activities of the special counsel, with whom he continues to cooperate,” Cobb said in a statement Sunday. On Monday, the Mueller’s office announced that another Trump aide, George Papadopolous, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with a Russian national during his time on the Trump campaign. Trump and the White House insist there was no collusion between his presidential campaign and Russia. Both have pointed a finger at Clinton and have suggested that the real story of collusion with Russia is the sale of uranium to Moscow when Clinton was secretary of state. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia interfered with the election to benefit Trump, a finding that Trump has not fully accepted. Mueller and Congress are looking into allegations of ties between Trump associates and Russia. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump gives a thumbs up as his then-campaign manager Paul Manafort (2nd R), and then-campaign official Rick Gates (2ndL) and daughter Ivanka (R) look on during Trump’s walkthrough at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in 2016. Photo by Rick Wilking/Reuters In the tweets, Trump referenced the fact that Clinton’s presidential campaign helped fund political research into Trump that ultimately produced a dossier of allegations about his ties to Russia. He also pointed to the uranium sale, the tens of thousands of emails from Clinton’s time at the State Department that she later deleted from a private email server, and the decision by then-FBI Director Jim Comey to not bring criminal charges against Clinton for possible mishandling of classified information. “Instead they look at phony Trump/Russia ‘collusion,’ which doesn’t exist. The Dems are using this terrible (and bad for our country) Witch Hunt for evil politics, but the R’s are now fighting back like never before,” Trump says across several tweets. “There is so much GUILT by Democrats/Clinton, and now the facts are pouring out. DO SOMETHING!” In a final tweet on the subject, Trump suggests that Russia’s re-emergence into the conversation is no accident. “All of this ‘Russia’ talk right when the Republicans are making their big push for historic Tax Cuts &amp; Reform. Is this coincidental? NOT!” On Wednesday, Republican lawmakers are scheduled to release a tax cut bill being pushed by the GOP lawmakers and Trump.

                                    — Updated on Oct 30, 2017 2:25 PM EST",Manafort and former business associate indicted in first charges from Mueller probe," The unsealing of the indictment came the same day that Special Counsel Robert Mueller announced that a former Trump campaign aide had pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents about the timing and detail of his attempts to line up meetings between Russian government officials and the Trump campaign. The plea by George Papadopoulos marked the first criminal charges that cite interactions between Trump campaign associates and Russian intermediaries during the 2016 presidential campaign. The charges brought Mueller’s sprawling investigation into a new phase, with campaign aides including the man who once led the president’s campaign facing felony charges and possible prison sentences. Papadopoulos’ plea occurred on Oct. 5 and was unsealed Monday. In court papers, he admitted to lying about the nature of his interactions with “foreign nationals” who he thought had close connections to senior Russian government officials. Manafort’s indictment doesn’t reference the Trump campaign or make any allegations about coordination between the Kremlin and the president’s aides to influence the outcome of the election in Trump’s favor. The indictment does allege a criminal conspiracy was continuing through February 2017. The indictment filed in federal court in Washington accused both men of funneling tens of millions of dollars in payments through foreign companies and bank accounts as part of their political work in Ukraine. Manafort and Gates have plead not guilty to all charges. Both men appeared before a federal judge Monday in Washington. The indictment lays out 12 counts including conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to launder money, acting as an unregistered foreign agent, making false statements and several charges related to failing to report foreign bank and financial accounts. The indictment alleges that they moved money through hidden bank accounts in Cyprus, St. Vincent and the Grenadines and the Seychelles. In total, more than $75 million flowed through the offshore accounts. Manafort is accused of laundering more than $18 million, according to the indictment. A spokesman for Manafort did not immediately return calls or text messages requesting comment. Manafort and Gates have previously denied any wrongdoing. The White House declined to comment on the charges. Manafort, 68, was fired as Trump’s campaign chairman in August 2016 after word surfaced that he had orchestrated a covert lobbying operation on behalf of pro-Russian interests in Ukraine. The indictments against Manafort and Gates were largely based on activities disclosed in August 2016 by The Associated Press, which reported that the pair had directly orchestrated a covert Washington lobbying operation on behalf of Ukraine’s ruling political party. Citing internal emails, the AP noted that Gates personally directed the work of two prominent Washington lobbying firms. The indictment quotes from some of the same emails the AP had obtained. The indictment accuses Manafort and Gates of orchestrating a nearly decade-long conspiracy to covertly work for Ukrainian interests and launder millions of dollars through offshore accounts. Specifically, the indictment accuses Manafort of using “his hidden overseas wealth to enjoy a lavish lifestyle in the United States, without paying taxes on that income.” That included using offshore accounts to purchase multimillion-dollar properties in the U.S., some of which the government is seeking to seize. Mueller was appointed as special counsel in May to lead the Justice Department’s investigation into whether the Kremlin worked with associates of the Trump campaign to tip the 2016 presidential election. The appointment came one week after the firing of James Comey, who as FBI director led the investigation, and also followed the recusal months earlier of Attorney General Jeff Sessions from the probe. Mueller’s investigators have focused on Manafort for months. In July, they raided one of his homes in Virginia, searching for tax and international banking records. Manafort joined Trump’s campaign in March 2016 and oversaw the convention delegate strategy. Trump pushed him out in August amid a steady stream of negative headlines about Manafort’s foreign consulting work. Trump’s middle son, Eric Trump, said in an interview at the time that his father was concerned that questions about Manafort’s past were taking attention away from the billionaire’s presidential bid. Former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, one focus of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, hides behind his car visor as he leaves his home in Alexandria, Virginia. Photo by Jonathan Ernst/Reuters Manafort has been a subject of a longstanding FBI investigation into his dealings in Ukraine and work for the country’s former president, Viktor Yanukovych. That investigation was incorporated into Mueller’s broader probe. Previously, he denied any wrongdoing related to his Ukrainian work, saying through a spokesman that it “was totally open and appropriate.” Manafort also recently registered with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for parts of Ukrainian work that occurred in Washington. The filing under the Foreign Agents Registration Act came retroactively, a tacit acknowledgment that he operated in Washington in violation of the federal transparency law. Mueller’s investigation has also reached into the White House, as he examines the circumstances of Comey’s firing. Investigators have requested extensive documents from the White House about key actions since Trump took office and have interviewed multiple current and former officials. Mueller’s grand jury has also heard testimony about a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower attended by a Russian lawyer as well as Manafort, Donald Trump Jr., and the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. In Gates, Mueller brings in not just Manafort’s chief deputy, but a key player from Trump’s campaign who survived past Manafort’s ouster last summer. As of two weeks ago, Gates was still working for Tom Barrack, a Trump confidant, helping with the closeout of the inauguration committee’s campaign account. Correction: An early version of this post incorrectly identified Rick Gates in the headline.  He is a former business associated of Paul Manafort, not Donald Trump. Associated Press writers Michael Biesecker, Stephen Braun, Tom LoBianco and Jeff Horwitz contributed to this report. PBS NewsHour will update this story as it develops.

                                    — Updated on Oct 29, 2017 5:23 PM EST",Virginia’s governor’s race draws big names from both parties," Virginia is the only competitive governor’s race in the country, and the contest between Republican Ed Gillespie and Democrat Ralph Northam could be an early referendum on President Donald Trump’s political popularity ahead of the 2018 midterm elections. Former Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. and U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris of California spent the weekend at get-out-the-vote rallies and black churches trying to rally Democrats around the statewide ticket. “Virginia has the fate of our country in its hands,” Harris, a rising Democratic Party star widely mentioned as a potential national candidate, said at rally Sunday at a Richmond cidery. Gillespie has an event scheduled Sunday evening with U.S. Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio and a Monday event with U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida. Gillespie campaigned last week with New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez. Gillespie, a White House adviser to President George W. Bush and former lobbyist, has run on lower taxes, tougher policies toward immigrants who are in the state illegally and preserving the state’s Confederate statues. Northam is a pediatric neurologist who has pledged to continue many of the policies of current term-limited Gov. Terry McAuliffe. Northam has promised increased spending in public education, tighter gun rules and strong support for abortion rights. Both mild-mannered candidates will be looking for a high-profile surrogate to help boost turnout in an off-year election, when voter interest typically dips. Gillespie, who is viewed skeptically by some Trump supporters, has campaigned with Vice President Mike Pence but has not said whether he plans to invite the president to campaign with him. For Northam, Democratic Attorney General Mark Herring and lieutenant governor candidate Justin Fairfax, a key focus in big-name visits has been on boosting African-American turnout. President Barack Obama rallied with the ticket earlier this month, and Holder, the country’s first black African-American attorney general, invoked civil rights icons to motivate Virginians to vote when he spoke Sunday. “Too many people sacrificed too much to give everybody the right to vote,” Holder said. Holder is chairman of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, which seeks to elect Democrats in statewide elections ahead of the next redistricting and has invested heavily in Northam’s campaign. The next Virginia governor, to be elected on Nov. 7, also will have a major say in the state’s next congressional redistricting. Gillespie helped quarterback a Republican wave in statehouse elections around the country in 2010 — just before the last redistricting — that has helped the GOP maintain a firm grip on the U.S. House. In Virginia, Democrats often complain of unfairly drawn districts in the last round, pointing out that Democrats hold every statewide office but Republicans have a majority in both state chambers and in congressional seats. Amber Caldwell, a Chester resident who showed up to hear Holder and Harris speak Sunday, said she’s been particularly motivated to support Northam because of the importance of redistricting. “It determines everything,” she said.

pbs,N/A,Military on verge of sentencing Bergdahl for desertion," In 2014 President Barack Obama swapped five Taliban prisoners held at the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay Cuba for U.S. Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, who had been held by the Taliban inside Afghanistan for five years. Mr. Obama did not grant Bergdahl clemency for what some military officials considered Bergdahl’s crime, desertion. That’s because the Taliban captured Bergdahl in 2009 only after he abandoned his post. In the resulting search for him, fellow soldiers came under fire and several were seriously wounded. On the campaign trail. Candidate Donald Trump called Bergdahl a traitor. And this year Bergdahl underwent a court martial proceeding. Bergdahl pleaded guilty and now at Fort Bragg North Carolina, he’s undergoing a military justice hearing to determine his punishment which could be a life sentence. National Public Radio reporter Greg Myre is covering the case and joins me now from Washington. So this is now the sort of prosecution phase, if you will. What’s the government’s case? Greg Myre: Well, their case is Bergdahl’s disappearance and his capture by the Taliban led to this enormous urgent effort to try to find him and we got to we certainly got the flavor of that this week in the testimony as we heard for soldiers that searched for him and indeed two who were wounded as part of that search. Both were were shot. So this certainly gave us a sense of how intense the effort was after he disappeared. And that indeed this, this put American soldiers at a much greater risk in a very dangerous part of Afghanistan and therefore the punishment for Bergdahl should be quite severe in the prosecution’s view. Hari Sreenivasan: As these soldiers were going out did they know the backstory or whether he had deserted? Did they know the kind of risk that they were taking for this soldier? GREG MYRE: They certainly did and we saw that in a number of ways. One of those who testified was a Navy SEAL, James Hatch and he testified that he said out loud after he learned that he would go on a mission to try to find Bergdahl, he said, someone is going to get killed or hurt looking for this kid. They also showed a video that one of the soldiers made as they were walking out and he sort of says sarcastically in the video, doing all this just because some dude walked off and we heard about days and days of sleeping in the ground, being sent in different directions. In this 100-degree summer heat of Afghanistan, intense prolonged missions that were different from the other kinds of missions they had been doing before his disappearance. Hari Sreenivasan: All right so what’s his defense going to be? There are going to be a couple more witnesses on the military side. What are Bowe Bergdahl’s lawyers going to say? Greg Myre: Well, given from what they’ve said so far, we think they’ll they’ll point out that he spent five years in the custody of the Taliban and their ally, the Haqqani network, under incredibly harsh conditions. Bergdahl has talked about this himself, that he was kept in a cage much of that time, he was chained, he was beaten, he tried to escape, that there was incredibly harsh punishment there, that he was not defecting as some had had talked about while he was missing but in fact he was walking off his post to find a more senior officer to complain about things that he felt were not being done properly in his unit. So that, it was a completely misguided effort on his part, but there was no malice, he was not trying to harm his fellow troops in any way or or join the Taliban. Hari Sreenivasan: What about the statements of then-candidate and now Commander in Chief Trump? Greg Myre: This has become an issue in the case. Bergdahl’s lawyers filed a motion to dismiss the case in the beginning of this year when Trump took office because there is this military principle known as unlawful command influence and it, quite simply it means a military commander can’t influence or even give the appearance of influencing a legal case. The military takes it very seriously. The judge tossed that aside but just two weeks ago, Trump said, I can’t comment but I think you know how I feel, you think people heard what I said before. So Bergdahl’s lawyers have brought this up again asking for a dismissal or perhaps factoring this into the sentencing. The judge is is considering it. He hasn’t made his decision yet. He said he will, but it’s it’s a very important principle that commanders cannot even be seen as giving the impression or appearance of trying to influence the case. Hari Sreenivasan: All right, Greg Meyer of National Public Radio joining us from Washington. Thanks so much. Greg Myre: Thank you. Watch the Full Episode Oct 06 By Josh Lederman and Lolita C.

pbs,N/A,How the anti-Trump dossier came to be," The secret funder of a once secret dossier of opposition research on Donald Trump has been unmasked. The dossier, produced during last year’s presidential campaign, purported to document possible connections between Russians and Trump Organization business or the Trump campaign. The Washington firm Fusion GPS had been hired to produce the dossier during the Republican primary season, and it eventually assigned the task to a British former intelligence officer named Christopher Steele. That’s all been known for months. Now, we know who originally hired Fusion GPS. The chairman and the editor of the conservative website Washington Free Beacon confirm they did so for information on “multiple Republican candidates.” At the same time, Free Beacon denied paying for the Steele dossier or having any contact with him.  Free Beacon said its research ended before Steele began his work. A key financial backer of Free Beacon is Paul Singer, a billionaire New York investor who is among the country’s most active Republican donors. Since 2012, Singer has given more than 40 million dollars to Republican and conservative candidates for federal office, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Recipients included Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio, who competed with Trump for the Republican nomination. Earlier this week, another Washington law firm, Perkins Coie, which represented the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, said it continued to pay Steele for his work after Trump secured the nomination. The Steele dossier, published after the campaign by Buzzfeed, contained salacious and unverified information about Mister Trump and his 2013 visit to Moscow. The White House had no comment today on the revelations about the original funding of the dossier.  Yesterday, Trump press secretary Sarah Sanders said if there was any collusion with Russia, it was the Democratic National Committee and the Clintons who colluded. The House of Representatives’ Intelligence Committee says The Free Beacon has agreed to cooperate with its probe into Russian meddling into the election. The committee has also subpoenaed bank records from Fusion GPS. For more on the mystery and controversy surrounding the trump dossier, I am joined by Associated Press reporter Tom Lobianco. The House of Representatives Intelligence Committee says the Free Beacon has agreed to cooperate with its probe into Russian meddling into the election. The committee is also subpoenaed bank records from Fusion GPS. For more on the mystery and controversy surrounding the Trump dossier, I am joined by Associated Press reporter Tom LoBianco. So for people who haven’t been following this closely, this is something, this is a document that we started hearing about really in the fall of last year as the campaigns were in full swing. Tom Lobianco: That’s right. I mean there’s some great reporting by Mother Jones where they interviewed who would later turn out to be Christopher Steele himself. It got lost in the mix at that point. But you know as we’ve see here it’s just an ever, ever-growing importance behind this document. And you know the latest revelation was a big one. This connection with Free Beacon and potentially Paul Singer, the Republican billionaire, Republican donor, mega-donor. So you know tons of drama involved here an incredible amount of importance. And you know ties of course right back into all the Russia investigations that we’re seeing. Hari Sreenivasan: Now the Trump administration, a lot of conservatives, say this document was the basis for the entire Mueller investigation. Tom Lobianco: Right. Yeah. So obviously there’s a lot of spin and tugging and pulling from both sides on this so that, you know, for their part, that’s probably overstating it a little bit. But there is, you know, clearly there’s been some interest in this document and they do appear to be following certain threads out of this document. Hari Sreenivasan: Even if the sort of impetus for why this investigation by Christopher Steele or why this was even created or who funded it, the contents of what that dossier had in it. Is that something that the Mueller investigation is looking into? Tom Lobianco: Well here’s what we know about the Mueller investigation right now. And it’s, it’s interesting to put this in context here. So what, we’re at the end of the end of October right now. We have had this investigation for about five or six months now. Mueller’s investigation, which takes over the federal investigation that has been going on for about a year. This thing has amped up significantly. We’ve seen interviews with Reince Priebus, Sean Spicer, by Mueller’s investigators. We have seen him speak with Keith Kellog, somebody who is very close with Michael Flynn. The grand jury interviewed Paul Manafort’s spokesman. There was the FBI raid of Paul Manafort’s home in Virginia. A lot has been going on and how much of this ties back directly to that dossier, it’s hard to say right now. Flynn and Manafort are definitely two key players that they’re investigating. Tom Lobianco: You know, there’s a lot of extraneous threads that we see in this whole thing. You’ll see a lot, multiple House and Senate investigations going on. Some will claim to be Russia, the Russia investigation. There’s a lot of political back and forth on this. But in terms of keeping your eye on the ball really watch what Muller is doing and he’s become much more active in the last month or so publicly so. Hari Sreenivasan: So there were salacious bits in the dossier that haven’t been verified or confirmed. But one of the overarching themes of the dossier is that the Russians meddled in the American election and that, intelligence agencies have said, is a fact. Tom Lobianco: Yeah. I mean that seems to be you pretty much universally accepted at this point, with the stark exception of the president of course. Of course he has a political reason to fight back against that. But for everyone else there seems to be a pretty wide acceptance that that is the case. And we’ve seen evidence to that effect. We had the meeting that we discovered with Trump Jr., Paul Manafort for it and Jared Kushner and the Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya and we found that a little bit more about that this past week, learned that the document that she had handed over to them in the meeting was very similar to a document put together by the Kremlin for Congressman Dana Rohrabacher, someone who U.S. intelligence had alerted Dana Rohrabacher himself that that they were trying to basically court him as a spy, trying to groom him. So, you know, look there’s, we find out more and more the longer this goes on. Now you know was it effective? Did it swing the election? The White House will often say well you know no votes were changed, and that’s not one of the the accusations that’s out there. But the bigger question, did this influence the election? And was it collusion in the campaign between the Trump campaign and the Russian operatives? We don’t have definitive answers on those yet. What we do know is that people are still pulling on these threads and we constantly find out more. So you know is this at the beginning, the finish, the middle? It’s hard to tell but it sure feels like this could go on for a while. Hari Sreenivasan: Right. Associated Press reporter Tom LoBianco joining us from Washington today. Thanks so much. Tom Lobianco: Thank you. Correction: The headline of this story has been updated to more accurately reflect the history of the dossier.

pbs,"Oct 28, 2017 2:00 PM EST",Power of anti-Trump resistance in question in Virginia race," The Nov. 7 contest pits Democratic Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam, a physician, Army veteran and former state senator, against Ed Gillespie, onetime aide to President George W. Bush and former head of the Republican Party. The current governor, Democrat Terry McAuliffe, is term-limited. The stakes in Virginia are immense: Though Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton won the state by five percentage points in 2016, Republicans typically are more likely to turn out in off-year statewide elections. Northam has led in most polls, but the race is close. A loss would be devastating after Democrats failed to capture any GOP-held seats in contested special congressional elections earlier this year that galvanized anti-Trump activists. The next Virginia governor also will have a major say in the state’s next congressional redistricting. A Republican wave in statehouse elections around the country in 2010 — just prior to the last redistricting — has helped the GOP maintain a firm grip on the House. Former President Barack Obama highlighted the importance of the Virginia race last week at his first large political rally since leaving office, urging Democrats not to get “a little sleepy” in the off-year election. “I think that it’s great that you hashtag and meme,” the former president told a crowd in Richmond, “but I need you to vote.” Northam bested former Rep. Tom Perriello, a populist favorite of the resistance who was backed by Sen. Bernie Sanders, in the Democratic primary. Sanders’ political operation, Our Revolution, recently endorsed six Democrats running for the state House of Delegates, but did not endorse Northam. Diane May, a spokeswoman for the group, said it can only endorse candidates recommended by local members and none in Virginia recommended Northam. Some activists say it’s obvious that the liberal wing of the party isn’t as engaged in the governor’s race. “We absolutely want to see them win, but that’s the difference between inspiring and driving a Democratic base to get out there for you and someone who you just want to win,” said Charles Chamberlain, executive director of the group Democracy For America. “If he doesn’t win, this will be why.” Fundraising underscores some ambivalence. Northam has raised $8 million more than Gillespie through September. He had $5.7 million cash on hand at the end of last month compared with Gillespie’s $2.5 million. But Northam’s fundraising advantage is due largely to his in-state fundraising efforts, not to out-of-state activists pouring money in. Northam and Gillespie have each raised about $2.5 million from out-of-state contributors, not including Washington-based donors like the Democratic Governors Association and its GOP equivalent, according to nonprofit money tracker the Virginia Public Access Project. And Northam hasn’t reported any donations from Democratic super donors like billionaires George Soros and Donald Sussman who largely funded his primary opponent’s campaign. Still, others in the resistance say they’re working hard in the governor’s race and see no lack of enthusiasm. The prominent anti-Trump group Indivisible has sent three paid staffers to Virginia and recently asked its chapters across the country to organize phone banks to help Northam and Democrats in the Virginia state legislative races. “We have folks who are clamoring to make the calls from across the country,” said Isaac Bloom, the group’s organizing director. Northam spokesman David Turner said the campaign just came off a record-breaking voter canvassing last weekend and “there’s a lot of enthusiasm and excitement on the ground in Virginia.” He said Obama’s visit has helped highlight to out-of-state activists the importance of this race, particularly when it comes to redistricting. Act Blue, which channels small-dollar donations to Democratic candidates, says that more than triple the number of people have donated to Virginia races this year as did in all of 2013. Democrats have gained six state legislative seats in special elections in Oklahoma, Florida and New Hampshire even as they lost the more headline-drawing congressional elections. “We’re just seeing people plain engaged,” Act Blue Executive Director Erin Hill said. The group Flippable has targeted five House of Delegate races in the state and expects to net as many donations as it did for Democrat Jon Ossoff in the Georgia special congressional election he lost earlier this year. Co-founder Catherine Vaughan said Democrats need to re-learn the importance of state elections after losing more than 1,000 state legislative seats and several governor’s races during the Obama years. “Democrats kind of dropped the ball there,” Vaughan said, adding she worries that in the rush to win back the House in 2018, activists could lose sight of the importance of state-level wins again. Michael Casentini, 41, a small business owner in Los Angeles, was devastated by Trump’s election and desperate for ways to fight back. In May, he wrote a $215 check to Ossoff as that race became a rallying cry for the anti-Trump resistance. Casentini obsessively follows the news, so he knows there’s a tight race for Virginia governor next month. But he didn’t know the name of the Democratic candidate. “People are tired, people are exhausted,” Casentini said in an interview. But after talking about the Virginia race with a reporter, he said he realized he should make a donation to Northam. “That’s another one we liberals need to jump on,” Casentini said. Riccardi reported from Denver. Left:

pbs,"Oct 28, 2017 11:59 AM EST",JFK files release does little to quell conspiracy theories," The release of thousands of records relating to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy hasn’t settled the best-known, real-life whodunit in American history. But the record offered riveting details of the way intelligence services operated at the time and are striving to keep some particulars a secret even now. “The Kennedy records really are an emblem of the fight of secrecy against transparency,” said Peter Kornbluh, senior analyst at the private National Security Archive research group in Washington. “The ‘secureaucrats’ managed to withhold key documents and keep this long saga of secrecy going.” The 2,800 records released on Thursday night include some that had dribbled out over the years but are getting renewed attention from being in this big batch. Some highlights: HOOVER, WORRIED Just a few hours after Lee Harvey Oswald was killed in Dallas, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover dictated a memo saying the government needed to issue something “so we can convince the public” that Oswald killed President John F. Kennedy. The memo was in the latest trove of Kennedy assassination files released late Thursday. The FBI director composed the memo on Nov. 24, 1963 — two days after Kennedy was killed and just hours after nightclub owner Jack Ruby fatally shot Oswald in the basement of the Dallas police station. Hoover said that the FBI had an agent at the hospital in hopes of getting a confession from Oswald, but Oswald died before that could happen. Hoover said he and a deputy were concerned about “having something issued so we can convince the public that Oswald is the real assassin.” Hoover laments how Kennedy’s successor, President Lyndon B. Johnson, was considering appointing a presidential commission to investigate the assassination. Hoover said he suggested that the FBI give an investigative report to the attorney general complete with photographs, laboratory work and other evidence. That report, he thought, could be given to Johnson and he could decide whether to make it public. “I felt this was better because there are several aspects which would complicate our foreign relations,” Hoover wrote. He said Oswald wrote a letter to the Soviet Embassy in Washington, which the FBI intercepted, read and resealed. Hoover said the letter had been addressed to the Soviet Embassy official “in charge of assassinations and similar activities on the part of the Soviet government. To have that drawn into a public hearing would muddy the waters internationally,” Hoover wrote. Besides, Hoover said, the letter was unrelated proof that Oswald committed the murder.  LBJ’s THEORY Everyone has their theories, including even President Lyndon B. Johnson. According to one document released on Thursday, Johnson believed Kennedy was behind the assassination of the South Vietnamese president weeks before his death and that Kennedy’s murder was payback, the newly released documents say. U.S. Director of Central Intelligence Richard Helms said in a 1975 deposition that Johnson “used to go around saying that the reason (Kennedy) was assassinated was that he had assassinated President (Ngo Dinh) Diem and this was just justice.” “Where he got this idea from I don’t know,” U.S. Director of Central Intelligence Richard Helms said in a 1975 deposition. Diem and his brother were killed on Nov. 2, 1963 after a coup by South Vietnamese generals. This isn’t the first time Johnson’s theory has been aired. He was also quoted in Max Holland’s book, The Kennedy Assassination Tapes, as saying that Kenney died because of “divine retribution.” “He murdered Diem and then he got it himself,” Johnson reportedly said. Kennedy’s position on Diem’s assassination is still debated, said Ken Hughes, a historian at the University of Virginia’s Miller Center. A month before Diem’s assassination, the south Vietnamese generals planning the coup told the CIA that they would overthrow the government if they could be assured that American aid would continue and Kennedy told them it would, Hughes said. But a dispute remains over whether Kennedy insisted that Diem go unharmed or whether the president left it up to the South Vietnamese generals to decide what to do, said Hughes, who is writing a book on the subject. One of the files that could shed light on that question is a CIA report on the U.S. government’s involvement in the Diem coup. The record was supposed to be released Thursday but was among the hundreds that Trump blocked from becoming public. KGB’s THEORY The former Soviet Union’s intelligence agency allegedly claimed it had information tying Johnson to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The allegation was contained in long-secret files released Thursday. In a 1966 letter to a presidential assistant, Hoover wrote that an FBI source reported KGB officials claimed to have information in 1965 “purporting to indicate” Johnson had a role in the assassination. The source had “furnished reliable information in the past,” the letter states. The source said the KGB residency in New York received instructions from Moscow in September 1965 to “develop all possible information” on Johnson, who was considered “practically an unknown” to the Soviet government at the time. Those instructions contained the assertion that the KGB had information tying Johnson to an assassination plot, according to the source. Johnson has long been a focus of some conspiracy theorists, but no credible information has been revealed linking him to the assassination. CASTRO, THE CIA AND A MOBSTER’S MISTRESS A 1975 document described the CIA’s $150,000 offer to have Cuban leader Fidel Castro assassinated — but the mob insisted on taking the job for free. The underworld murder-for-hire contract was detailed in a summary of a May 1962 CIA briefing for then-Attorney General Robert Kennedy. By then, the Kennedy White House had launched its unsuccessful Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba and several assassination attempts against Castro had failed. At least two efforts to kill Castro were made with CIA-supplied lethal pills and organized crime-made muscle in early 1961, according to the document. The CIA’s mob contacts included John Rosselli, a top lieutenant to Chicago mob boss Sam Giancana, who weren’t told but guessed the CIA was behind the offer. The pair, later victims of mob hits, said they want no part of any payment — but still, $11,000 in payments were made for expenses. The mobsters came to the attention of the CIA a year earlier when Giancana asked a CIA intermediary to arrange for putting a listening device in the Las Vegas room of an entertainer he suspected of having an affair with Giancana’s mistress. The task was handed off to a private investigator named Arthur Balletti, who put the listening device in a phone in the hotel room. “The CIA reportedly did not know of the specific proposed wiretap.” Told later about “everything,” Kennedy was “unhappy, because at that time he felt he was making a very strong drive to try to get after the Mafia. “So his comment was to us that if we were going to get involved with the Mafia, in the future at any time, to ‘make sure you see me first.'” The document was made public in 1997 and contained in an Associated Press report at that time. STRANGE CALL A British newspaper received an anonymous phone call about “big news” in the United States 25 minutes before President John F. Kennedy was shot in 1963, one file says. A batch of 2,800 declassified documents includes a Nov. 26, 1963 memo from the CIA to FBI director J. Edgar Hoover about a call received by the Cambridge News on Nov. 22, the day Kennedy was killed in Dallas, Texas. The memo from deputy CIA director James Angleton says the caller said “the Cambridge News reporter should call the American Embassy in London for some big news, and then hung up.” Anna Savva, a current Cambridge News reporter, said Friday there’s no record of the call. “We have nobody here who knows the name of the person who took the call,” she said. The memo was released by the U.S. National Archives in July. The phone call to the Cambridge News was first reported decades ago by Kennedy conspiracy theorist Michael Eddowes. In the 1980s, Eddowes, a British lawyer, claimed to have a CIA document mentioning the call. Eddowes, who died in 1992, wrote a book alleging that Kennedy’s assassin was not Lee Harvey Oswald but a Soviet impostor who took his identity. As a result of his efforts, the killer’s body was exhumed in 1981. An autopsy confirmed that it was Oswald. Associated Press Writers Deb Riechmann and Dave Porter contributed to this report. Left:

pbs,"Oct 28, 2017 10:55 AM EST",Mattis says threat of nuclear attack by North Korea accelerating," In remarks in Seoul with South Korean Defense Minister Song Young-moo at his side, Mattis accused the North of illegal and unnecessary missile and nuclear programs — and vowed to defeat any attack. Mattis said North Korea engages in “outlaw” behavior and that the U.S. will never accept a nuclear North. He added that regardless of what the North might try, it is overmatched by the firepower and cohesiveness of the decades-old U.S.-South Korean alliance. “North Korea has accelerated the threat that it poses to its neighbors and the world through its illegal and unnecessary missile and nuclear weapons programs,” he said, adding that U.S.-South Korean military and diplomatic collaboration thus has taken on “a new urgency.” “I cannot imagine a condition under which the United States would accept North Korea as a nuclear power,” he said. As he emphasized throughout his weeklong Asia trip, which included stops in Thailand and the Philippines, Mattis said diplomacy remains the preferred way to deal with the North. “With that said,” he added, “make no mistake — any attack on the United States or our allies will be defeated, and any use of nuclear weapons by the North will be met with a massive military response that is effective and overwhelming.” Mattis’ comments did not go beyond his recent statements of concern about North Korea, although he appeared to inject a stronger note about the urgency of resolving the crisis. While he accused the North of “outlaw” behavior, he did not mention that President Donald Trump has ratcheted up his own rhetoric. In August, Trump warned the North not to make any more threats against the United States, and said that if it did, it would be met with “fire and fury like the world has never seen.” Song, the South Korean minister, told the news conference that he and Mattis agreed to further cooperation on strengthening Seoul’s defense capabilities, including lifting warhead payload limits on South Korean conventional missiles and supporting the country’s acquisition of “most advanced military assets.” He offered no specifics and refused to answer when asked whether the discussions included nuclear-powered submarines. Some South Korean government officials have endorsed the nation getting nuclear-powered submarines amid calls for more military strength. There’s a growing concern among the South Korean public that North Korea’s expanding nuclear weapons arsenal, which may soon include an intercontinental ballistic missile that could target the U.S. mainland, would undermine Seoul’s decadeslong alliance with Washington. South Korea’s conservative politicians have also called for the United States to bring back tactical nuclear weapons that were withdrawn from the Korean Peninsula in the 1990s, which they say would make clearer the U.S. intent to use nukes in a crisis. But Mattis and Song were strongly dismissive of the idea. “When considering national interest, it’s much better not to deploy them,” said Song, adding that the allies would have “sufficient means” to respond to a North Korean nuclear attack even without placing tactical nukes in the South. Mattis said current U.S. strategic assets are already providing nuclear deterrence and that the South Korean government has never approached him with the subject of tactical nukes. Also discussed in the meeting were the conditions under which South Korea would be given wartime operational control of its forces. Currently, if war with the North broke out, the South’s forces would operate under the U.S.-led U.N. Command. Trump entered office declaring his commitment to solving the North Korea problem, asserting that he would succeed where his predecessors had failed. His administration has sought to increase pressure on Pyongyang through U.N. Security Council sanctions and other diplomatic efforts, but the North hasn’t budged from its goal of building a full-fledged nuclear arsenal, including missiles capable of striking the U.S. mainland. If Trump sticks to his pledge to stop the North from being able to threaten the U.S. with a nuclear attack, something will have to give — either a negotiated tempering of the North’s ambitions or a U.S. acceptance of the North as a nuclear power. The other alternative would be U.S. military action to attempt to neutralize or eliminate the North’s nuclear assets – a move fraught with risk for South Korea, Japan and the United States. At his Seoul news conference, Mattis said the North is, in effect, shooting itself in the foot. “If it remains on its current path of ballistic missiles and atomic bombs, it will be counterproductive, in effect reducing its security,” he said. Mattis touched off unease in South Korea last month when he told reporters at the Pentagon that the United States has military options for North Korea that doesn’t put Seoul at risk. At Saturday’s briefing, Mattis didn’t offer a direct answer to what those options are or how and when they would be used. “Our military options as I mentioned are designed to buttress the diplomats’ efforts to maintain a deterrence stance and denuclearize the Korean Peninsula,” he said. While the allies are committed to deterring North Korea, they also need “many different military options that would realistically reduce that threat as low as possible,” Mattis said. “And yes, we do have those options,” he said. The North says it needs nuclear weapons to counter what it believes is a U.S. effort to strangle its economy and overthrow the Kim government. This was Mattis’s second visit to South Korea since taking office in January. He made a point of going to Seoul and Tokyo on his first overseas trip in February, saying he wanted to emphasis the importance he places on strengthening alliances and partnerships. On Friday he visited the Demilitarized Zone that forms an official buffer between the two Koreas. He appeared there with Song in what they both called a show of solidarity. U.S. government officials for decades have confidently but mistakenly predicted the approaching collapse of North Korea, given its economic and political isolation. Twenty years ago, Mattis’s predecessor five times removed, William Cohen, said as he peered into North Korea from inside the DMZ that its communist system was “decaying and dying.” His view was widely shared in Washington, but, like others, he underestimated the resilience of Pyongyang’s family dynasty, which began with Kim Il Sung. The current ruler assumed control of the country shortly after his father, Kim Jong-Il, died in December 2011, and has accelerated the country’s nuclear and missile programs. Left:

pbs,"Oct 28, 2017 9:32 AM EST",AP report: Website with GOP ties funded research on Trump dossier," The Washington Free Beacon on Friday confirmed it originally retained the political research firm Fusion GPS to scour then-candidate Trump’s background for negative information, a common practice known as “opposition research” in politics. Leaders from the Free Beacon, which is funded largely by Republican billionaire Paul Singer, insisted none of the early material it collected appeared in the dossier released later in the year detailing explosive allegations, many uncorroborated, about Trump compiled by a former British spy. “During the 2016 election cycle we retained Fusion GPS to provide research on multiple candidates in the Republican presidential primary, just as we retained other firms to assist in our research into Hillary Clinton,” wrote the site’s editor-in-chief, Matthew Continetti, and chairman Michael Goldfarb. They continued: “The Free Beacon had no knowledge of or connection to the Steele dossier, did not pay for the dossier, and never had contact with, knowledge of, or provided payment for any work performed by Christopher Steele.” Earlier in the week, reports revealed that the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee continued funding Fusion’s work after the original GOP source lost interest. Trump this week called it a “disgrace” that Democrats had helped pay for research that produced the document. But the original source of the research remained a secret. The president himself hinted that he knew the Republican source earlier in the week, but he refused to share it. The White House had no immediate comment Friday night about the Free Beacon’s involvement. The Washington Free Beacon was initially founded as a project of the conservative nonprofit group Center for American Freedom, as an alternative to liberal news sites run by progressive nonprofits. The Center for American Freedom was organized as a 501(c)4 and did not reveal its donors, but Singer was the sole funder of the site as recently as 2014, according to a Republican political veteran familiar with the site. The veteran spoke on condition of anonymity to detail the newspaper’s financial background. The Free Beacon first retained Fusion to investigate Trump in the fall of 2015 and ended its relationship after Trump secured the Republican presidential nomination in late spring of 2016, according to a person close to Goldfarb, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share private discussions. The website and its leaders have strong ties throughout the Republican establishment. Goldfarb was deputy communications director on John McCain’s presidential campaign. Singer was backing Florida Sen. Marco Rubio’s presidential bid at the time of the Free Beacon’s involvement. And one of Singer’s closest associates, Republican operative Dan Senor, served as Speaker Ryan’s chief adviser during the 2012 president campaign. A representative to Singer did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Rubio denied any knowledge of the Fusion research or the dossier this week. “As far as whether it was my campaign, it wasn’t and I’ll tell you why,” he told CNN. “I was running for president. I was trying to win. If I had anything against Donald Trump that was relevant and credible and politically damaging, I would’ve used it. I didn’t have it.” The document, compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele, emerged this year as a political flashpoint in the broader debate over Trump’s ties to Russia. A person close to Singer said the billionaire was not aware of Steele’s involvement or the dossier until earlier this year when it was published. The person was not authorized to share internal discussions. Law enforcement officials have worked to corroborate the dossier’s claims. James Comey, FBI director at the time, advised Trump about the existence of the allegations, and Steele has been questioned as part of an ongoing probe into possible coordination between Russia and the Trump camp. The U.S. intelligence community has determined that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. election. Special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating the Russian interference and whether it was tied to Trump’s campaign. The House Intelligence Committee will help verify whether the Free Beacon had any involvement with Steele or his dossier, according to Jack Langer, a spokesman for House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes. “The Beacon has agreed to cooperate with the House Intelligence Committee to help the Committee verify this assertion,” Langer said. Miller reported from Washington. Associated Press writers Chad Day, Mary Clare Jalonick, Stephen Braun and Tom LoBianco in Washington contributed to this report. Left:

pbs,N/A,"Shields and Brooks on Flake’s Trump diatribe, confronting powerful men on sexual harassment"," The rift in the Republican Party widened this week, as outgoing Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona called on his party to stand up to President Trump, and House Republicans aired their disagreements over a plan to overhaul the tax code. That brings us to the analysis of Shields and Brooks. That’s syndicated columnist Mark Shields and New York Times columnist David Brooks. And, gentlemen, welcome to both of you. So, we have spent much of this week examining, talking about that stunning speech, David, that Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona gave on the Senate floor this week, where he essentially took on the president and challenged his colleagues. Let’s first just listen to a short excerpt of that. Sen. Jeff Flake, R-ariz.: We must never regard as normal the regular and casual undermining of our democratic norms and ideals. We must never meekly accept the daily sundering of our country, the personal attacks, the threats against principles, freedoms and institution, the flagrant disregard for truth and decency, the reckless provocations most often for the pettiest and most personal reasons, reasons having nothing whatsoever to do with the fortunes of the people that we have been elected to serve. Judy Woodruff: That was Jeff Flake on the Senate floor. David, what change — what effect has that speech had? David Brooks: Well, it sounded like a call to arms at the moment, but it’s pretty clear it was Appomattox in reality. What Flake made clear is that you can’t survive a Republican primary if you don’t sound like Donald Trump. And whether with Flake leaving, Corker leaving, McCain sort of in the end — toward the end of his career, the Republicans who want have a political viability have to be Trumpian. And so what you have is most of the Republicans saying, I may not like this guy privately, I may worry about this guy, but this is my guy, I am going to support him. And so this was really the week, I thought, something atmospheric shifted and Donald Trump, and Steve Bannon really took control of the Republican Party. Judy Woodruff: Mark? Mark Shields: Yes, I think David is absolutely right, Judy, that the Republican Party is the wholly owned subsidiary of Donald Trump at this point. And the polls show it that Republican voters rate Donald Trump off the boards in high marks and actually give negative marks to Republicans in Congress. So, the choice has been made, it would seem. And I thought that when Jeff Flake said the fragrant disregard for truth and decency, and then Bob Corker, senator from Tennessee’s indictment as well, they aren’t philosophical difference. I mean, Bob Corker obviously talked about the danger of World War III and Donald Trump’s not coherent leadership, but they’re an indictment of character. And that’s — but for the other Republicans to remain silent on that, if that’s the question, if character is the question, then they just say, oh, we just want to worry about our own reelection. Judy Woodruff: Well, let me ask you about that, David, because Jeff Flake went on to say to his fellow Republicans, our children are watching, and he asked — he said, what are we going to do about that? What are we going to do when the next generation asks us, how did we respond at this time, in other words, saying they are complicit. David Brooks: You know, I had some conversations with some Republican senators who support Donald Trump, by and large, and I guess their argument is, well, you know, I really believe in this tax cut, he’s for that, we can get some economic policy passed. When his administration calls my office to say who they want to be deputy secretary and this and that, and I give them a name, they hire the person, so I have been able to have some influence on the administration in that way. And I grant, for some conservatives, Trump offers something, and maybe the administration is hiring a lot of their former staffers in a way they think is good and influential. But I guess I would say, your priorities are messed up, that if you are supporting Donald Trump because he will get you a tax bill you like, you’re putting money above morals. And the character and the morals of the country and the social fabric of the country are more important than whether the tax rate is 39.6 or 35.4. And so — and I would ask them to think about that. I guess when I do make that point, a lot of the things I find outrageous about Donald Trump’s behavior, they seem kind of distant and they treat those things as unimportant. They put sort of a vast distance between them and some of the daily fights and dishonesties that I think characterize a lot of this president’s behavior. Judy Woodruff: So, Mark, are we talking about values here? What does it come down to? Mark Shields: Well, I certainly think that’s the way that Jeff Flake framed it. It is a question of character. It’s destiny. And I think the fact is, Judy, David mentioned tax cuts, and that’s it. That’s the last stage out of Dodge for the Republicans. They have failed at every turn in this Congress and in the Trump administration. They have nothing to show. They talk about Justice Gorsuch. Fine. But they really have nothing to show, no accomplishments with total Republican dominance of both the Congress and the presidency. So, this is it. And this is the one thing that ties them together. You know, it’s shameless. A party that talks so movingly about balancing the budget and not putting the burden on our children and grandchildren, and adding $1.5 trillion, they voted to this week — the president pushed to do it — and to the new debt over the next 10 years. And, you know — but this is it. This is their last chance to say, we did something in this election. And the key, the problem that Republicans are facing and a real confrontation is, the FOX News poll showed that Republicans, if you could vote for — had to vote for Congress today, would you vote for a Democrat or Republican? And by 50 to 35, people say they would vote for a Democrat. And even in 19 — yes, go ahead. Judy Woodruff: No, I was just going to say, so you’re saying the Republicans have that to worry about? Mark Shields: They have a general election in November of 2018 that they have to be scared silly about, given those numbers in the FOX News poll. Judy Woodruff: Well, given that, David, and the fact so many Republicans are saying, we need to work together to get something done, what are the prospects for tax reform, tax cuts? David Brooks: Well, I think they’re pretty grim. You know, they might be able to fall back to some sort of tax cut of something, maybe the corporate tax rate or something like that, but getting some sort of big bill, where they take on some of the deduction for local taxes, for the 401(k)s, there are pretty entrenched interests. And it takes a lot of political skill to get that kind of more comprehensive reform passed. So I’m not particularly optimistic about that. If I could just take one point that Mark made, and maybe go a little deeper, what’s been interesting to me — and my colleague Tom Edsall has written about this — is that the nature of the party affiliation has changed in the last few years. It’s no longer really about ideology. It’s no longer about belief system. It’s about identity. It’s as if being, say, Pennsylvanian or an Italian American or a Jewish American, all the things that people who used to form their identity about, those have all fallen away. And now it’s just, are you a Republican or a Democrat? And that’s become the primary identity marker for a lot of people. And when you’re like that, you will follow your president or your party leader absolutely anywhere they’re willing to go. Judy Woodruff: And where does that lead us, Mark? Mark Shields: Well, it leads us to, Judy, to — there are 192 safe Republican House seats right now. They’re considered safe by Nathan Gonzales, who is a great analyst and appeared on our broadcast. And in there, your election is not — your concern is not nearly so much about November 2018, although it should be, because, right now, the outcome or the signs are dire, but you’re worried about the primary, and that’s what you don’t want. Bob Corker in Tennessee was at 61 percent/21 percent favorable, 3-1 favorable in February this year among Republican voters. Criticized Donald Trump, and he’s now at 37 percent/48 percent favorable among Republicans. Judy Woodruff: So, a drop. Mark Shields: A drop of, what, 60 — or 50 votes — 50 percent. So, that is what you’re scared of if you’re a Republican. But you’re terrified if you’re going into the general election, because Donald Trump is toxic, and he excites — the excitement and intensity right now is on the part of Democrats, rather than Republicans, heading into the next election. Judy Woodruff: But, David, to pick up on the point that — where you stopped and I asked Mark, where does it lead Republicans, if they are simply defining themselves by their party? David Brooks: Well, it probably leads them in a 38 percent position, which is pretty bad. The only thing I would say is, I wouldn’t underestimate the Democrats’ ability to mess this up. One of the things we have seen across Western Europe is the complete collapse of center-left parties. People who were in the center-left are now going to green parties. They’re going to socialist parties. They’re going left. And I think that’s happening here, too. And one of the things — I assume that’s going to happen. And what you see is, it looks like the Republican Party is in crisis, but they’re reasonably strong on the state and local level. But it could be that both parties are in crisis, which is what you do see in Britain and a lot of countries around the world, just a decay of the party system as we know it. Mark Shields: Yes. I think… Judy Woodruff: So, what are we going to end up with? Mark Shields: Well, in our country, where I guess I disagree with David is, a national party is defined by its leader, the face of the leader. You don’t have a coherent national philosophy for a party until you nominate a presidential nominee and probably elect a president. So until the Democrats do that, they will not have an overarching message. But, in 2018, all you have to be is the other guy, if there’s great dissatisfaction. Just to put the numbers in perspective, Judy, in 2010, when the Republicans picked up 63 House seats from the Democrats, won away 63 House seats, did the Republicans, the difference in that generic of who would you rather have, a Democrat or Republican, was nine points. It was nine points more Republican. Today, it’s 15 percent more Democrat. So, that really is unsettling. (CROSSTALK) Judy Woodruff: For Democrats. Mark Shields: That’s right. Yes. Judy Woodruff: Complete change — go ahead. David Brooks: It means they can’t move because of the partisan alignment, so they’re stuck losing, but they can’t be anything other than they are. Judy Woodruff: We’re going to keep on talking about this into 2018. I do want to change the subject, though, David, with what we — the interview that I did a few segments ago with Sheila Nevins, who’s probably the most powerful woman in television filmmaking, about her own experience with sexual harassment. She said in that interview that she thinks the country has now — is now going to change, that men are not going to be able to get away anymore with what they have gotten away with before now. What do you think? David Brooks: Well, I do think the norms have been steadily shifting over the decades. But I thought the key point that she made is there’s — you can now, if you’re a woman and you have been harassed and oppressed, you can now join as a group. The technology makes this a lot easier, and that you can come out — because guys who are harassing, it’s not just one case. It tends to be a lot of cases. And so people can come out as a group. They can find each other online. And they can say, yes, this happened to all of us, and it’s a lot more effective. So, I don’t think the norms have shifted. The stuff that people are being accused, everybody knew that was awful. But what is happening this week is, the punishments are coming down in a way that we have never seen before. Judy Woodruff: Are things changing, Mark? Mark Shields: Oh, I think have changing dramatically and are changing dramatically. Just imagine, 1991, Judy, when the Clarence Thomas hearings and Anita Hill case appeared. That male Judiciary Committee was just — shamed her, and were adversarial. Just think if that testimony were given today by somebody of Anita Hill’s credentials and believability. You would have to take it seriously. I think women in position of power — this is about abuse in these actions we hear. It’s cruelty, but, most of all, it’s about power. It’s somehow that I can exercise power and that you’re not another human being. And until every man acknowledges that every woman is either his sister, his mother, his daughter, his niece, his favorite child, then I’m afraid that this is considered a perk by a number of powerful men. Judy Woodruff: And, David, that’s my question. As long as men hold the vast majority of the powerful jobs in this country, powerful roles, is anything really going to change? I understand you’re saying women can now speak up as a group, but they are still going to be facing this. David Brooks: Yes, the power dynamics will be what they are. But this is not going to go away. Abuse of women in — around society is as old as time, because some men have some power addiction. They have a masochism. Some men have an addiction to seduction, where they’re always crudely coming on and sort of driven by some sort of pathetic hole. And so the idea that it’s going to stop happening is not going to — it’s not going to stop. It’s just woven into some people’s distorted natures. But at least they can stop getting away with it. And I do think that is becoming much and much more likely, that they will get caught. Judy Woodruff: Well, we certainly hope that some things are changing for the better. David Brooks, Mark Shields, thank you both. Mark Shields: Thank you, Judy. Watch the Full Episode Oct 27 By PBS NewsHour Oct 27 By PBS NewsHour Support Provided By:

pbs,"Oct 27, 2017 6:25 PM EST",Facebook ads: Social media giant announces new transparency," Executives for the social media company said Friday they will verify political ad buyers in federal elections, requiring them to reveal correct names and locations. The site will also create new graphics where users can click on the ads and find out more about who’s behind them. More broadly, Rob Goldman, Facebook’s vice president in charge of ad products, said the company is building new transparency tools in which all advertisers — even those that aren’t political — are associated with a page, and users can click on a link to see all of the ads any advertiser is running. Users also will be able to see all of the ads paid for by the advertisers, whether or not those ads were originally targeted toward them. The move comes after the company acknowledged it had found more than 3,000 ads linked to Russia that focused on divisive U.S. social issues and were seen by an estimated 10 million people before and after the 2016 U.S. elections. Facebook, Twitter and Google will testify in Congress next Tuesday and Wednesday on how their platforms were used by Russia or other foreign actors in the election campaign. The Senate and House intelligence committees and the Senate Judiciary Committee are all holding hearings as part of their investigations into Russian election interference. Facebook’s announcement comes a day after Twitter said it will ban ads from RT and Sputnik, two state-sponsored Russian news outlets. Twitter also has said it will require election-related ads for candidates to disclose who is paying for them and how they are targeted. Facebook’s Goldman said the company also will build a new archive of federal election ads on Facebook, including the total amount spent and the number of times an ad is displayed, he said. The archive, which will be public for anyone to search, would also have data on the audience that saw the ads, including gender and location information. The archive would eventually hold up to four years of data. Goldman said the company is still building the new features. They plan to test them in Canada and roll them out in the United States by next summer ahead of the 2018 midterm elections. “This is a good first step but it’s not at all the last step, there’s a lot to learn once we start testing,” Goldman said in an interview. Facebook already had announced in September that the platform would require an advertiser to disclose who paid for the ads and what other ads it was running at the same time. But it was unclear exactly how the company would do that. The moves are meant to bring Facebook more in line with what is now required of print and broadcast advertisers. Federal regulations require television and radio stations to make publicly available the details of political ads they air. That includes who runs the ad, when it runs and how much it costs. It is also likely meant to head off bipartisan legislation in the Senate that would require social media companies to keep public files of election ads and try to ensure they are not purchased by foreigners. Though Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, a Democratic co-sponsor of the legislation, has said his bill would be “the lightest touch possible,” social media companies would rather set their own guidelines than face new regulation. Facebook has responded swiftly to the attention it has received in recent months on Capitol Hill, boosting staff and lobbying efforts. The company has spent more than $8.4 million in lobbying Congress and the rest of the government through the third quarter of this year, according to federal records. The company’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, visited several congressional offices this month to convey that the company is taking the issue seriously. Facebook has also turned over the 3,000 ads to Congress and special counsel Robert Mueller, who is doing his own investigation of Russian interference in the election and whether it was tied to President Donald Trump’s campaign. Warner, who is the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, said on Thursday that the moves by the social media companies in the week leading up to the hearings “show a growing recognition of how serious this problem is.” Still, he said, he wants to see at the hearings next week a “fuller disclosure of exactly what happened in 2016.” Some analysts have warned that policing such online election ads can be difficult. It’s one thing to enforce advertising rules for a print newspaper or a TV station, where real humans can vet each ad before it is printed or aired. But that is much more complicated when automated advertising platforms allow millions of advertisers — basically anyone with a credit card and internet access — to place an ad. To address that challenge, Goldman says his company will try to create new tools for enforcement. “For political advertisers that do not proactively disclose themselves, we are building machine learning tools that will help us find them and require them to verify their identity,” he said in a Facebook blog post.

pbs,"Oct 27, 2017 5:09 PM EST",Senate Judiciary’s Russia probe veers into partisanship," After months of negotiations with Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley stalled, California Sen. Dianne Feinstein sent five letters of her own on Friday to witnesses and companies involved in the probe. The letters were sent to the White House, Facebook, Twitter and President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen. There is also a letter to Cambridge Analytica, a data firm working for Trump’s campaign during the 2016 election. The inquiries are designed to get more information about whether the Russian meddling was in any way connected with Trump’s campaign. Feinstein indicated this week that negotiations had broken down with Grassley, who has also sought to investigate issues surrounding Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. The two senators have been talking since the summer about how to handle several witnesses, including whether to subpoena Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and whether to call Trump’s son Donald Trump Jr. for a public hearing. Both men were involved in a June 2016 campaign meeting with Russians. Trump Jr. spoke to committee staff behind closed doors in September. As a member of the minority party, Feinstein could have a hard time getting responses. But she is trying anyway, asking the social media companies in particular for a wide range of information, some of which they have already declined to turn over because of privacy concerns. Facebook and Twitter, along with Google, will testify before a panel subcommittee on Tuesday about the Russian meddling. In the White House letter, Feinstein asks White House counsel Don McGahn for a range of documents related to fired FBI Director James Comey. Going beyond a May request for documents she made with Grassley, which was not answered, Feinstein is asking for several other letters and memos surrounding his firing and about other figures key to the panel’s probe. A release from Feinstein’s office said the letters were the “first tranche” of letters and that “additional requests are expected to be sent in the coming weeks.” Also Friday, the House intelligence committee announced that it will hold a hearing Nov. 2 with Carter Page, a foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign. The hearing is listed as “open in a closed space,” which a committee spokeswoman said means that it will be closed to press, but a transcript will eventually be released. Left:

pbs,"Oct 27, 2017 4:50 PM EST",Rep. Jackie Speier describes harassment ordeal in online video," “Many of us in Congress know what it’s like, because Congress has been a breeding ground for a hostile work environment for far too long,” Rep. Jackie Speier says in a brief video she posted on Twitter and YouTube. Looking directly at the camera, the 67-year-old Democrat says the office’s chief of staff “held my face, kissed me and stuck his tongue in my mouth.” She says she knows what it means to keep such stories bottled up. “I know what it’s like to lie in bed at night, wondering if I was the one who had done something wrong,” she says in a matter-of-fact tone. “I know what it’s like years later to remember that rush of humiliation and anger.” In the video, Speier urges current and former congressional aides to tell their stories on a new hashtag, #MeTooCongress. Similar “#MeToo” hashtags have attracted numerous stories of harassment from celebrities and others since earlier this month, when reports detailed allegations of sexual harassment and rape against Weinstein. “There is nothing to fear in telling the truth,” says Speier, who represents an area south of San Francisco. “And it’s time to throw back the curtain on the repulsive behavior that until now has thrived in the dark without consequences.” Speier, first elected to the House in 2008, has pushed legislation requiring that lawmakers and staff take training on sexual harassment issues. She plans to introduce a similar measure soon, a spokeswoman said. The Congressional Office of Compliance has jurisdiction over workplace issues on Capitol Hill. Speier and others have complained that its procedures are too weak. The lawmaker has also focused on sexual assault in the military and on college campuses. And she attracted attention during a 2011 House debate on abortion when she described undergoing the procedure herself because of a medical problem. Speier was in her twenties and an aide to Rep. Leo Ryan, D-Calif., when the incident occurred, a Speier spokeswoman said. In 1978, Speier was with Ryan on a trip to Jonestown, Guyana, when the congressman and four others were shot and killed by followers of the Rev. Jim Jones, a San Francisco cult member who Ryan was investigating. Speier was wounded in the airport attack. The Oscar-winning Weinstein was fired from his studio, The Weinstein Company, after The New York Times reported on the harassment allegations against him. He apologized without addressing any specific conduct, but has denied other allegations by several women that he raped them. Left:

pbs,"Oct 27, 2017 4:11 PM EST",White House says tax cuts could add $1.2T to U.S. economy," Kevin Hassett, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, released a 41-page report on Friday detailing the possible benefits from the administration’s goal of slashing the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent. The report estimates the reduced rates for businesses could increase the size of the U.S. economy by $700 billion to $1.2 trillion over a decade, while causing average household income to eventually surge by $4,000 annually. Democratic lawmakers and many economists are doubtful that Trump’s tax cuts can deliver the boosts suggested by Hassett. They have said that Hassett cherry-picked his evidence and that most of the benefits from corporate tax cuts would go to wealthy investors rather than middle-class workers. “This is their latest installment of trickle down fairy dust,” said Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and a former economics adviser in the Obama administration. Bernstein stressed that he sees benefits from a smart redesign of the corporate tax code that lowered rates and closed loopholes. But the Trump plan, he said, is assuming unrealistic gains. The framework backed by the administration and Congressional Republican leaders puts more emphasis on cutting taxes for companies and could increase the budget deficit, which would possibly hurt long term economic growth. Hassett said in a phone call with reporters Friday that he’s “optimistic” that the possible economic growth generated from the plan will mean “it won’t significantly add to the deficit” and could be revenue neutral after 10 years. His argument is that lower corporate tax rates would lead to more investments by companies in equipment and workers, which would increase productivity and incomes. The White House report separately suggested that lower corporate rates could reduce the U.S. trade gap, since companies would have less of an incentive to book their profits overseas. The possible benefits of this weren’t included in the reports estimated income growth, but the result would be faster growth for the U.S. gross domestic product. In the accounting for GDP, trade deficits subtract from growth. Adam Looney, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and former Obama-era Treasury Department official, said that any additional gains would largely be contained in the GDP figures, since the amount of money being invested in the United States would not change much. “Those are purely accounting measures, not real changes,” Looney said. “It would be using a different yardstick.” Left:

pbs,"Oct 27, 2017 2:02 PM EST",WATCH: Trump administration disavows Puerto Rico power contract," WASHINGTON — The Trump administration said Friday it had no involvement in the decision to award a $300 million contract to help restore Puerto Rico’s power grid to a tiny Montana company in Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke’s hometown. The White House said Friday that federal officials played no role in the selection of Whitefish Energy Holdings by the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority. Trump spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the president had asked Zinke about the contract and that the cabinet secretary said he had nothing to do with it. “He had no role in that contract,” Sanders said of Zinke. “This was a state and local decision made by the Puerto Rican authorities and not the federal government.” The administration is seeking to distance itself from the issue amid a growing number of investigations and a bipartisan chorus of criticism from Capitol Hill. The Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general, an agency watchdog, confirmed Friday that federal auditors will review the Whitefish contract. “As part of their standard procedure, they will conduct vetting to look for the presence of any inappropriate relationships,” said Arlen Morales, a spokeswoman for the inspector general’s office. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is part of Homeland Security, said it has not approved any reimbursement requests from the utility for money to cover ongoing repairs to the island’s power grid following Hurricane Maria. FEMA said in a statement that any language in the controversial contract saying the agency approved of the deal with Whitefish is inaccurate. The contract said the utility would not pay costs unallowable under FEMA grants, but it also said, “The federal government is not a party to this contract.” The agency said its initial review raised significant concerns about how Whitefish got the deal and whether the contracted prices were reasonable. The 2-year-old company had just two full-time employees when the storm hit Sept. 20. It has since hired more than 300 workers. The Interior Department has denied that Zinke, a former Montana congressman, played any role in the contract award. Zinke knows Whitefish CEO Andy Techmanski “because they both live in a small town where everyone knows everyone,” a spokeswoman said. Zinke’s son had a summer job at a Whitefish construction site. Multiple congressional committees have launched investigations into the deal, the terms of which have triggered questions from both Republicans and Democrats. Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri, senior Democrat on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said the Whitefish contract “raises every red flag in the book.” The homeland security panel will hold a hearing on the issue next week, and officials should be ready to answer tough questions, the senator said. Democrats also raised questions about the role of HBC Investments, a key financial backer of Whitefish Energy. The Dallas-based company’s founder and general partner, Joe Colonnetta, has contributed thousands of dollars to Trump and other Republicans, including Energy Secretary Rick Perry, a former Texas governor, and Texas Sens. John Cornyn and Ted Cruz. Colonnetta also gave to Trump’s inauguration. A Whitefish spokesman called Colonnetta’s political donations “irrelevant.” ”If one of the investors supported President Trump, that has nothing to do with anything,” spokesman Chris Chiames said. Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority director Ricardo Ramos has praised the work performed by Whitefish so far, saying the company’s was the only offer the utility received that did not require a down payment. The power company is $9 billion in debt and was already struggling to provide service amid ongoing power outages before hurricanes Irma and Maria hit last month. “There is nothing illegal going on here,” Ramos said Thursday. Power company spokesman Carlos Monroig said Ramos was not immediately available for an interview on Friday. A federal control board that oversees Puerto Rico’s finances said this week it had appointed a former military officer to oversee the work. Retired Air Force Col. Noel Zamot will be responsible for speeding up reconstruction efforts and overseeing coordination with the board, Puerto Rico’s government and the federal government. It was not immediately clear whether Zamot would have the authority to void Whitefish’s contract, although under the contract the utility can suspend or terminate the contract “for any or no reason” after providing written notice to Whitefish and compensating the company for actual expenses. Board spokesman Jose Luis Cedeno said Zamot was not immediately available for an interview. About 75 percent of the U.S. territory remains without power more than a month after the Category 4 storm made landfall. Zamot told Puerto Rico radio station WKAQ 580 on Friday that once a judge confirms him as chief transformation officer of Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority, he will review all of the agency’s contracts. “We’re going to be incredibly transparent,” he said, declining further comment on any issues related to Whitefish. Puerto Rico Public Affairs Secretary Ramon Rosario told reporters on Friday that he wasn’t familiar with the contract’s details when asked why it includes a clause that prohibits an audit or review of “the cost and profit elements of the labor rates.” Rosario said only that Puerto Rico’s governor already has requested an audit and that the government will turn over all pertinent documents. “There are some legitimate claims,” Rosario said. “If anyone did anything illegal, let them fry in jail.”

pbs,"Oct 27, 2017 9:56 AM EST",AP fact check: Anti-drug campaigns of yesteryear show little success," Trump declared the country’s opioid overdoses a public health emergency on Thursday and laid out steps to combat addiction and abuse with heroin and prescription painkillers, drugs that kill nearly 100 Americans daily. Trump put special emphasis on advertising to discourage young people from trying drugs, saying, “They will see the devastation and the ruination it causes.” “I think that’s going to end up being our most important thing,” Trump said in a speech from the White House. “Really tough, really big, really great advertising, so we get to people before they start.” Yet government and academic assessments of “Just Say No”-style messages have repeatedly shown poor results. Between 1998 and 2004 the U.S. government spent nearly $1 billion on a national campaign designed to discourage use of illegal drugs among young people, particularly marijuana. A 2008 follow-up study funded by the National Institutes of Health found the campaign “had no favorable effects on youths’ behavior” and may have actually prompted some to experiment with drugs, an unintended “boomerang” effect. More recently, anti-drug campaigns have shifted their focus, appealing to teenagers’ desire for independence and self-control rather than drug fears. A 2011 study of the government’s “Above the Influence” campaign suggested eighth-graders who had seen the campaign were slightly less likely to have tried marijuana than those who had not. Other drug prevention campaigns from the 1980s and 1990s have also fared poorly under scientific review. A 2009 review of 20 studies of school-based D.A.R.E. programs showed students who underwent training were about as likely to try drugs as those who didn’t. The program, founded in the early 1980s, sent local police officers into thousands of U.S. schools to warn about the dangers of drug use. “The evidence is clear that the D.A.R.E. programs, fear-based advertising, and Just Say No campaigns of the 1980s had no benefits at all,” said Keith Humphreys, a psychiatrist at Stanford University who served as a drug policy adviser under President Barack Obama. Humphreys pointed to community-based outreach programs as a more effective way to influence high-risk behavior in school children. A 2014 study of one program, Communities that Care, showed that students enrolled in the program in fifth grade were more likely to abstain from drugs, tobacco and alcohol as 12th-graders.

pbs,"Oct 27, 2017 9:17 AM EST",What you need to know about the newly released JFK files," The government was required by Thursday to release the final batch of files related to Kennedy’s assassination in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963. But President Donald Trump delayed the release of some of the files, citing security concerns. Experts say the publication of the last trove of evidence could help allay suspicions of a conspiracy — at least for some. “As long as the government is withholding documents like these, it’s going to fuel suspicion that there is a smoking gun out there about the Kennedy assassination,” said Patrick Maney, a presidential historian at Boston College. What to expect from the files: HOW MANY FILES ARE THERE AND HOW CAN I SEE THEM? The last batch of assassination files included more than 3,100 documents — comprising hundreds of thousands of pages — that have never been seen by the public. About 30,000 documents were released previously with redactions. The National Archives released more than 2,800 documents on its website Thursday evening. But Trump delayed the release of the remaining files after last-minute appeals from the CIA and FBI. Trump cited “potentially irreversible harm” to national security if he were to allow all the records out now and placed those files under a six-month review. Officials say Trump will impress upon federal agencies that JFK files should stay secret after the six-month review “only in the rarest cases.” WHY ARE THEY BECOMING PUBLIC NOW? President George H.W. Bush signed a law on Oct. 26, 1992, requiring that all documents related to the assassination be released within 25 years, unless the president says doing so would harm intelligence, law enforcement, military operations or foreign relations. The push for transparency was driven in part by the uproar in the wake of Oliver Stone’s 1991 conspiracy-theory filled film “JFK.” WHAT DO THE FILES SHOW? Scholars stress that it will take weeks to mine the documents for potentially new and interesting information. But the files show federal agents madly chasing after tips in the days after the Nov. 22, 1963, assassination and juggling rumors and leads worldwide. The materials also cast a wide net over varied activities of the Kennedy administration, such as its covert efforts to upend Fidel Castro’s government in Cuba. One document details efforts to interview people who may have seen Kennedy’s killer, Lee Harvey Oswald, while he was traveling to Mexico before the assassination. Another file describes individuals being monitored as potential threats, including a person who sent a letter to the president in December 1963 that said “you’re doomed.” After an interview with that person, an official wrote: “Said letter was a joke. Not dangerous. Attending 5th grade.” WILL THERE BE ANY BOMBSHELLS? JFK experts believe the files will provide insight into the inner workings of the CIA and FBI. But the chances of a bombshell are slim, according to the judge who led the independent board that reviewed and released thousands of the assassination documents in the 1990s. The files that were withheld in full were those the Assassination Records Review Board deemed “not believed relevant,” Judge John Tunheim of Minnesota told The Associated Press. But Tunheim said it’s possible the files contain information the board didn’t realize was important two decades ago. Left:

pbs,"Oct 27, 2017 9:03 AM EST",Pentagon chief Mattis stresses diplomacy as the answer to ending Korean crisis," He made the point over and over — at the Panmunjom “truce village” where North literally meets South; at a military observation post inside the Demilitarized Zone, and in off-the cuff comments to U.S. and South Korean troops. “We’re doing everything we can to solve this diplomatically — everything we can,” he told the troops after alighting from a Black Hawk helicopter that had ferried him to and from the border some 25 miles north of central Seoul. “Ultimately, our diplomats have to be backed up by strong soldiers and sailors, airmen and Marines,” he added, “so they speak from a position of strength, of combined strength, of alliance strength, shoulder to shoulder.” At Panmunjom, where the armistice ending the Korean war was signed in July 1953, Mattis quoted Secretary of State Rex Tillerson as saying, “Our goal is not war.” The aim, he said, is to compel the North to completely and irreversibly eliminate a nuclear weapons program that has accelerated since President Donald Trump took office. Despite unanimous condemnation by the U.N. Security Council of the North’s missile launches and nuclear tests, “provocations continue,” Mattis said. As Mattis arrived at Panmunjom alongside South Korean Defense Minister Song Young-moo, a small group of apparent tourists watched from the balcony of a building on North Korea’s side of the line that marks the inter-Korean border. Uniformed North Korean guards watched silently as Mattis and Song stood just yards away. Atop Observation Post Ouellette, where he could see deep into North Korea and hear their broadcast taunts of the South, Mattis listened to Song recount some of the history of the 1950-53 Korean war in which thousands of Americans and perhaps more than a million Koreans died in a conflict that remains officially unsettled. “It reminds us that we fought together in very difficult times, and we stick together today,” Mattis said inside a Demilitarized Zone of craggy terrain, millions of landmines and ghost-like reminders of the war. The U.S. has about 28,500 troops based in South Korea and has maintained a military presence there since the Korean War ended. Mattis’s counterpart, Song, gave the former four-star Marine general the lay of the land, noting that the North has 342 long-range artillery pieces aimed at Seoul, among other weapons. That’s a threat that cannot be defended against, Song said, so Washington and Seoul must come up with “new offensive concepts” to be able to eliminate the artillery before it can be used, should war break out. Mattis called the North “an oppressive regime that shackles its people, denying their freedom, their welfare and their human dignity in pursuit of nuclear weapons and their means of delivery in order to threaten others with catastrophe.” He noted that earlier this week in the Philippines, he and Song joined Southeast Asian defense ministers in committing to a diplomatic solution to the North Korea problem, even though Pyongyang and its young leader, Kim Jong Un, show no interest in negotiations. Two other developments Thursday showed the U.S. intention to continue building diplomatic and economic pressure on Pyongyang. The Trump administration imposed sanctions on 10 North Korean officials and organizations over human rights abuses and censorship, including a diplomat in China accused of forcing North Korean asylum seekers home. Meanwhile, a rare military exercise involving three of the U.S. Navy’s aircraft carrier strike groups was being planned for next month in the Asia Pacific, a U.S. official said. The likely exercise would happen around the time that Trump travels to the region, including to Seoul. The three Navy carriers and the ships that accompany them are currently thousands of miles apart in the Indian Ocean and the Pacific. But they are moving through the region and could be closer together in weeks. Trump entered office declaring his commitment to solving the North Korea problem, asserting that he would succeed where his predecessors had failed. His administration has sought to increase pressure on Pyongyang through U.N. Security Council sanctions and other diplomatic efforts, but the North hasn’t budged from its goal of building a full-fledged nuclear arsenal, including missiles capable of striking the U.S. mainland. On Saturday, Mattis will be joined by Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in annual consultations with South Korean defense officials. They are expected to admonish North Korea, vow to strengthen allied defenses, and discuss prospects for eventually giving South Korea wartime control of its own forces. Left:

pbs,N/A,News Wrap: House passes GOP budget despite conservative dissent," And in the day’s other news: The House of Representatives narrowly passed a Republican budget, paving the way for tax cuts of up to $1.5 trillion. Twenty Republican conservatives joined Democrats opposing the budget. They complained that the tax cuts could balloon deficit spending and eliminate state and local tax deductions. House Speaker Paul Ryan acknowledged the complaints, and promised the conservatives will be heard. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-wis., Speaker Of The House: The Ways and Means Committee will be putting out a specific plan very shortly and they are going to work with all of our members to look at and consider and address their concerns. I believe that the Ways and Means Committee will be working with these members in particular to find a solution. Judy Woodruff: On a separate note, Ryan played down the biting criticism of President Trump by Republican Senator Jeff Flake this week. He told reporters — quote — “I don’t think the American people care about that.” The Trump administration imposed new economic sanctions today on North Korea’s military and government leaders. It cited human rights abuses. And a State Department report showed satellite images of brutal prison camps in the North, and spoke of systematic killings and forced labor. In Indonesia, at least 47 people died in a massive explosion at a fireworks factory near Jakarta. The blast and inferno of flames collapsed the roof, as thick smoke billowed out. Most of the victims were female workers apparently locked inside. Kenya held a re-run of its presidential election today, but only part of the country voted. The rest was in turmoil, as opposition supporters battled police and boycotted the polls. John Ray of Independent Television News reports from Kenya. John Ray: The day Kenya went to vote, some places looked like they would go to war. At least three reported dead, and many more injured. A protester takes a beating from the police. No surprise if democracy is another casualty. Security forces fire tear gas into crowds of demonstrators, who hurl stones in return. In this opposition area, there is no question of voting today. Instead, all day, there have been these skirmishes between protesters and police. Kenya’s election will settle nothing. In fact, it is only increasing tensions. The opposition claims the election is rigged. Why is nobody here voting? Man: There’s no democracy. No democracy. John Ray: Do you think the election is being stolen? Man: Already, it has been stolen. John Ray: In the absence of a challenger, President Uhuru Kenyatta would seem guaranteed victory, though tarnished by a low turnout. President Uhuru Kenyatta, Kenya: All we’re asking is that Kenyans turn out. We are requesting them humbly that they should turn out in large numbers, cast their vote. John Ray: And in the capital, government loyalists did as they were asked by their president, though here they queued not in their many thousands, but by the few dozen. With just one contender, we know who will win the election, but not when the chaos will end. Judy Woodruff: That’s John Ray of Independent Television News. Spain’s Catalonia region moved closer to the brink of seceding today. The regional president declared he will not call new elections, as the central government in Madrid wanted. The political developments came as thousands of pro-independence protesters marched in the Catalan capital of Barcelona. Back in this country, there’s word that a computer server involved in a lawsuit over election security in Georgia has been wiped clean. The Associated Press reports that it happened in July, just after the suit was filed. The main defendant is the Republican secretary of state. His office denies any role in the erasure. MSNBC today suspended political journalist Mark Halperin over allegations of sexual harassment. At least five women say Halperin propositioned and groped them in the 1990s and early 2000s when he was political director at ABC News. They say that he — that they didn’t report the actions, for fear of retribution or embarrassment. Halperin has apologized for what he called — quote — “inappropriate behavior.” And on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 71 points to close at 23400. The Nasdaq fell seven, and the S&amp;P 500 added three. Watch the Full Episode Oct 26 By PBS NewsHour Support Provided By:

pbs,"Oct 26, 2017 6:33 PM EST",Congressional committees investigate Puerto Rico contract award," The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority awarded the contract to tiny Whitefish Energy Holdings to restore transmission and distribution lines damaged or destroyed during Hurricane Maria. The 2-year-old company had just two full-time employees when the storm hit last month. In the House, leaders of the Natural Resources and Energy and Commerce committees sent letters Thursday seeking documents about the contract, saying circumstances surrounding the award raise troubling questions. Meanwhile, Senate Energy and Natural Resources Chairman Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, vowed to hold a hearing on the issue. Two Democrats, Sens. Maria Cantwell of Washington state and Ron Wyden of Oregon, formally requested an investigation by the Government Accountability Office. Cantwell and Wyden questioned whether the contract cost was inflated, especially since work crews provided under mutual-aid agreements from other public utilities were available but not used. The lawmakers also complained about the “opaque and limited nature” of the bidding process conducted by the Puerto Rico authority and “contemporaneous communications” between Whitefish officials and senior members of the Trump administration, including Zinke. Cantwell is senior Democrat on the Senate Energy panel, while Wyden is top Democrat on Senate Finance. The Interior Department has denied that Zinke, a former Montana congressman, played any role in the contract award. Zinke knows Whitefish CEO Andy Techmanski “because they both live in a small town where everyone knows everyone,” a spokeswoman said. Zinke’s son had a summer job at a Whitefish construction site. Bipartisan leaders of the House Energy and Commerce panel said questions raised about Whitefish’s involvement in recovery efforts make it “important to develop a clear understanding of the facts.” The committee requested a series of documents from Whitefish and asked for a briefing for committee staff by Nov. 9. The letter is signed by Chairman Greg Walden, R-Ore., senior Democrat Frank Pallone of New Jersey and three other committee members. Separately, House Natural Resources Chairman Rob Bishop of Utah and Arkansas Rep. Bruce Westerman, chairman of an oversight and investigations subcommittee, asked the Puerto Rican power authority for all documents related to the Whitefish contract. While speed is necessary in an emergency such as Hurricane Maria, “transparency and accountability in government contracting” must never be compromised, they wrote in a letter to Ricardo Ramos, the power authority’s executive director. Ramos said in a radio interview Thursday that Whitefish is doing an “excellent job,” adding that he has no intention of canceling the contract. “There’s been nothing illegal here,” Ramos said. Nicole Daigle, a spokeswoman for Murkowski, said the Whitefish deal “is a very large contract for a relatively new and small company, and Sen. Murkowski intends to find out more about it.” The committee expects to explore the contract at a hearing next month on hurricane recovery efforts and reconstruction of the electric grids in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, Daigle said. Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., said he did not know Whitefish or its CEO, Techmanski. “The first I heard of the Whitefish Energy contract was through the news. I was surprised that such a small company from Montana got the contract,” Daines said. Associated Press writer Danica Coto in San Juan, Puerto Rico, contributed to this report. Left:

pbs,"Oct 26, 2017 6:25 PM EST",Senators diverge on Niger ambush after classified briefing," Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said Thursday that “on the initial assessment there were not significant steps that could have been taken to prevent this assault.” But Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., pointed to a shortfall in intelligence and overhead reconnaissance support for U.S. forces in Africa as a potential factor in an attack that caught many lawmakers off guard. “I could not look those families in the eye and say we’re doing everything we need to do to provide sufficient intelligence that will enable them to be successful in their missions and avoid the kind of catastrophe that we saw here,” Blumenthal said. Sen. John McCain, the chairman who has demanded Defense Secretary Jim Mattis keep the Armed Services Committee informed, said the briefing conducted by two senior Pentagon officials shed light in a number of areas. But McCain, who had threatened a subpoena to get information, said other key questions remain unanswered as the U.S. military continues to investigate a tragedy that is evolving into a political dispute. McCain, R-Ariz., said he wanted to know why it took so long to recover the body of American serviceman, Sgt. La David Johnson, who was missing for two days before his body was found by Niger troops and turned over to the U.S. He said Pentagon officials covered the matter but he indicated they didn’t know everything yet. “I had a lot of questions. All of us had questions,” he said. McCain responded testily when asked if the early October mission that led to the deaths of the American troops in Niger was a failure. “Do you think there’s a failure if four Americans are killed?” he said. Asked if the result was bad luck or bad strategy, McCain answered: “Both.” The briefing was conducted in a secure room in the Capitol by Robert Karem, assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs, and Air Force Maj. Gen. Albert Elton, the Joint Staff’s deputy director for special operations and counterterrorism. The Pentagon, meanwhile, separately confirmed for the first time that a second U.S. military team was involved in the operation that led to the Americans deaths. Lt. Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, the director of the Joint Staff, said there was a second team that “had something to do with the operation” and was “involved in the same timeline,” but he declined to provide any other details. The Associated Press reported earlier this week that the ambushed joint U.S. and Niger patrol was asked to help a second team of commandos that had been hunting for a senior member of al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb. A senior defense official said the ambushed team was asked to go to a location where the insurgent had last been seen to collect intelligence. The ambushed team was never asked to search for the insurgent, the official said. The official wasn’t authorized to discuss the details publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Marine Corps Gen. Thomas Waldhauser, the top officer at U.S. Africa Command, testified in March that American forces in Africa are constrained by Congress’ failure to provide consistent and adequate defense budgets. He said only between 20 and 30 percent of the command’s requirements for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance are met — the shortcoming Blumenthal referred to. “This limits situational understanding, support to operations, and fails to offer threat indications and warnings,” Waldhauser testified. Committee members said they’re anticipating the U.S. military to be more involved, not less, in Niger and other African countries. “The more we succeed in the Middle East, the more we’re going to see the snakes run to Africa,” said Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C. “And we’ve got to be prepared to advise and assist the nations there that are willing to work with us.” Associated Press writer Lolita Baldor contributed to this report. Left:

pbs,"Oct 26, 2017 4:56 PM EST",Words matter when it comes to declaring the opioid crisis an emergency," President Donald Trump declared a national public health emergency Thursday to deal with the nation’s opioid crisis. The announcement elevated the administration’s response to the crisis — but it stopped short of declaring the opioid epidemic a national emergency. What difference do the types of emergency declarations make? It all comes down to funding. National public health emergency declarations are made under the Public Health Service Act of 1944. That type of declaration gives agencies more flexibility to use existing federal funds and regulations to tackle the crisis at hand — but it doesn’t create new funding. Trump’s announcement Thursday directed Department of Health and Human Services Acting Director Eric Hargan to use existing health-specific resources — such as opening access to telemedicine, deploying federal and state employees to overwhelmed communities, and HIV-AIDS funds — to target opioids. Trump administration officials also said before the president’s announcement that they would continue to haggle with Congress to divert more money during end-of-year budget negotiations to stem opioid use, overdose and deaths. In contrast, the federal government responds differently when a president declares a “major disaster” or “emergency” under the Stafford Act. READ MORE: WATCH: Donald Trump declares opioid crisis a public health emergency That type of declaration frees up more federal resources to respond to a crisis, including allowing the government to tap into the Disaster Relief Fund, which had roughly $3.3 billion on hand as of Sept. 30. It’s also viewed as a longer-term solution, because the funding is more open-ended, and can continue to flow for years. National public health emergency declarations, on the other hand, only last 90 days — though they can be renewed for as many additional 90-day periods as necessary. For example, a public health emergency issued in August 2016 following the Zika virus outbreak in Puerto Rico has been renewed three times since. The Trump administration has issued other public health emergencies this year, including after the California wildfires, and to deal with the aftermath of Hurricane Nate on the Gulf Coast, and the devastation Hurricane Maria created in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. If Trump had declared a national emergency for the opioid crisis under the Stafford Act, it also would likely have been easier for Congress to appropriate new funding to fight the epidemic. Congress approved $3.3 billion in disaster relief funds, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, following Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, as well as wildfires that have swept the western United States. But according to a White House official, the Trump administration decided such a declaration was more appropriate for natural disasters, not the opioid crisis. The decision went against a blue-ribbon panel’s recommendation earlier this year. On July 31, the president’s Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis released its interim report, in which the “first and most urgent” recommendation was that Trump declare opioid use a national emergency.

                                    — Updated on Oct 26, 2017 5:05 PM EST",Democrats condemn proposed fee hikes at national parks," Under a plan announced this week, visitors to many national parks would be charged $70 per vehicle during the peak summer season, up from $25 or $30 per vehicle now. Officials say the higher fees are needed to address an $11 billion backlog of maintenance and infrastructure projects that have been put off for years. Senators said the plan would exclude many Americans from enjoying national parks. Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington state and other Democrats said the proposal is especially egregious because the Trump administration is recommending severe budget cuts for the park service. Claims that the increased fees are needed to reduce the maintenance backlog are “undercut by the administration’s budget proposal to cut” park service operations by $200 million, including a $93 million cut to facility operations and maintenance, the senators wrote. “If implemented, your proposals to increase fees while cutting agency funding would serve to shift major costs to park visitors and undermine public access to national parks — actions that would be a disservice to the American people,” they said. Cantwell, the senior Democrat on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, organized the letter. It also is signed by Democratic Sens. Patty Murray of Washington state, Kamala Harris and Dianne Feinstein of California, Ron Wyden of Oregon, Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, Tom Udall and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico and Tim Kaine of Virginia, as well as independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Theresa Pierno, president and CEO of the National Parks Conservation Association, an advocacy group that works to protect parks, said the proposed increase could make the Grand Canyon and other popular parks unaffordable for many families. “The solution to our parks’ repair needs cannot and should not be largely shouldered by its visitors,” she said. “If the (Trump) administration wants to support national parks, it needs to walk the walk and work with Congress to address the maintenance backlog” through the budget process. A 30-day public comment period opened Tuesday. The park service said it expects to raise $70 million a year with the proposal at a time when national parks repeatedly have been breaking visitation records and putting a strain on park resources. Nearly 6 million people visited the Grand Canyon last year. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said the plan was part of his “vision to look at the future of our parks and take action in order to ensure that our grandkids’ grandkids will have the same if not better experience than we have today.” Annual $80 passes for federal lands would not change, though fees would go up for pedestrians and motorcyclists. The higher fees would apply only during the five busiest contiguous months for parks. For most that’s May through September when many families are on vacation. The proposal would not affect several free weekends and holidays. Left:

pbs,"Oct 26, 2017 11:57 AM EST",House passes $4T budget in step forward for Trump tax plan," The 216-212 vote permits Republicans to begin work on a follow-up $1.5 trillion tax cut and move it through Congress without fear of blocking tactics by Democrats. The tax bill is the top item on the GOP agenda, would be Trump’s first major win in Congress — and, Republicans hope, a much-needed boost for the party’s political fortunes on the eve of next year’s midterm elections. GOP leaders scrambled in recent days to overcame opposition from House conservatives unhappy about deficits and debt, and lawmakers from high-tax states such as New York and New Jersey, who are upset about plans to curb the state and local tax deduction. The Senate passed the measure last week and the House endorsed it without changes, a step designed to allow Republicans to move quickly to the tax measure in hopes of passing it into law this year. “Big news — Budget just passed,” tweeted Trump. Republicans view passage of the upcoming tax measure as a career-defining dream, and its importance has only grown in the wake of the party’s debacle on health care. But the tax plan’s popularity is not a given with voters, and fissures among Republicans already threaten to slow the measure. Twenty Republicans opposed the measure, a mix of spending hawks and centrists. Several lawmakers from New York and New Jersey who supported the House plan earlier this month opposed the measure over worries about the state and local tax deduction. “This isn’t over,” said Rep. Tom MacArthur, R-N.J. Battles over the state and local tax deduction and tax-free contributions to retirement accounts have already broken open, and Republican tax writers have yet to lock down dozens of crucial details on tax rates and preferences. The underlying budget measure abandons the Republican Party’s longstanding promise to rein in deficits in favor of Trump’s boast of “massive tax cuts.” The measure drops proposed cuts to mandatory programs such as food stamps, though conservatives promise to take on spending cuts later. “I still feel strongly about addressing unsustainable mandatory spending,” said Rep. Diane Black, R-Tenn., who chairs the House Budget Committee. “I think we will tackle this important issue in the future. We don’t have a choice.” Democrats united against the plan, arguing its tax cuts will pad the bank accounts of the wealthy and the balance sheets of corporations, while delivering modest relief — or none at all — to middle-income taxpayers. “These tax cuts will not create an economic boom, but will instead lead to a higher concentration of wealth among the rich, while dramatically increasing deficits and debt,” said Rep. John Yarmuth, D-Ky. The budget plan calls for $5 trillion in spending cuts over the decade, including cuts to Medicare, Medicaid and the Obama-era health care law, though Republicans have no plans to actually impose those cuts with follow-up legislation. Some Democrats criticized the measure for ruthless spending cuts; others took the opposite approach, failing it for tackling the deficit. Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, says he’ll schedule a panel debate and vote once the budget plan is safely passed, and much of the buzz in the Capitol concerned a flurry of horse trading as Republicans struggled to find ways to raise revenues to help finance cuts to individual and corporate tax rates. The goal is a full rewrite of the inefficient, loophole-laden tax code in hopes of lower rates for corporations and other businesses and a spurt of economic growth. Brady, for instance, told reporters on Wednesday morning that he’s still looking at curtailing tax-free deposits in 401(k) retirement accounts, a move that could raise revenue in the near term as retirement savings shift to Roth-style accounts that are funded with after-tax earnings. Trump says he opposes curbing 401(k) donations, however, which tossed a monkey wrench into the process. And Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., came out squarely against reducing the cap on 401(k) contributions in an interview on CNN Thursday morning. “To do tax reform, you need money. And right now, even as we speak, they appear to be going wobbly on some of the issues they’ve raised with great certainty in previous weeks,” said top Ways and Means panel Democrat Richard Neal of Massachusetts. “They’ve got a revenue problem, a real revenue problem. And you have to make some dramatic changes to benefits that people across America have come to expect and enjoy.” An Associated Press-NORC poll released Wednesday found most Americans saying Trump’s tax plan would benefit the wealthy and corporations, and less than half believing his message that “massive tax cuts” would help middle-class workers.

pbs,"Oct 26, 2017 9:56 AM EST",Tea party groups settle lawsuits over IRS mistreatment," The Internal Revenue Service is apologizing to the groups as part of the proposed settlement agreements outlined in court filings Wednesday. The groups and the Justice Department are asking a judge to declare it illegal for the tax agency to discriminate based on political views, according to the agreements. Republicans erupted in 2013 after the IRS apologized for submitting conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status to intensive scrutiny, in part by zeroing in on groups with words like “Tea Party” or “Patriot” in their names. Many had their applications delayed for months and years. Some were asked improper questions about their donors and even their religious practices, an inspector general’s report found. Hundreds of organizations joined lawsuits, alleging their constitutional rights were violated. Some sought monetary damages, but the settlements reached don’t include a financial penalty, according to the documents. READ MORE: IRS lost more emails in tea party probe, investigators say Much of the agency’s leadership, including top official Lois Lerner, resigned or retired over the scandal. One of the proposed settlement agreements calls senior management “delinquent” in providing control and direction over the process. And it faults Lerner for failing to tell upper-level management of the long delays in processing applications from tea party and other conservative groups. The Obama Justice Department announced in 2015 that no one at the IRS would be prosecuted in the scandal, saying investigators had found mismanagement but no evidence that it had targeted a political group based on its viewpoints or obstructed justice. Republicans had hoped the Justice Department under Attorney General Jeff Sessions would reopen its case against Lerner. But officials told members of Congress last month they would not charge Lerner, saying “reopening the criminal investigation would not be appropriate based on the available evidence.” Still, Sessions condemned the misconduct in a statement Thursday announcing the settlement agreements, which still need a judge’s approval. “There is no excuse for this conduct,” Sessions said. “Hundreds of organizations were affected by these actions, and they deserve an apology from the IRS.” Left:

pbs,"Oct 26, 2017 9:34 AM EST",Georgia election server wiped after suit filed," The server’s data was destroyed July 7 by technicians at the Center for Elections Systems at Kennesaw State University, which runs the state’s election system. The data wipe was revealed in an email — sent last week from an assistant state attorney general to plaintiffs in the case — that was obtained by the AP. More emails obtained in a public records request confirmed the wipe. The lawsuit, filed by a diverse group of election reform advocates, aims to force Georgia to retire its antiquated and heavily criticized election technology. The server in question, which served as a statewide staging location for key election-related data, made national headlines in June after a security expert disclosed a gaping security hole that wasn’t fixed six months after he reported it to election authorities. WIPED OUT It’s not clear who ordered the server’s data irretrievably erased. The Kennesaw election center answers to Georgia’s secretary of state, Brian Kemp, a Republican who is running for governor in 2018 and is the main defendant in the suit. A spokeswoman for the secretary of state’s office said Wednesday that “we did not have anything to do with this decision,” adding that the office also had no advance warning of the move. The center’s director, Michael Barnes, referred questions to the university’s press office, which declined comment. Plaintiffs in the lawsuit, who are mostly Georgia voters, want to scrap the state’s 15-year-old vote-management system — particularly its 27,000 AccuVote touchscreen voting machines, hackable devices that don’t use paper ballots or keep hardcopy proof of voter intent. The plaintiffs were counting on an independent security review of the Kennesaw server, which held electronic poll book data and ballot definitions for counties, to demonstrate the system’s unreliability. Wiping the server clean “forestalls any forensic investigation at all,” said Richard DeMillo, a Georgia Tech computer scientist who has closely followed the case. “People who have nothing to hide don’t behave this way.” STATE SECURITY The server data could have revealed whether Georgia’s most recent elections were compromised by malicious hackers. The plaintiffs contend that the results of both last November’s election and a special June 20 congressional runoff— won by Kemp’s predecessor, Karen Handel — cannot be trusted. Possible Russian interference in U.S. politics, including attempts to penetrate voting systems, has been an acute national preoccupation since the Obama administration first sounded the alarm more than a year ago. Kemp and his GOP allies insist Georgia’s elections system is secure. But Marilyn Marks, executive director of the Coalition for Good Governance, a plaintiff, believes the server data was erased precisely because the system isn’t secure. “I don’t think you could find a voting systems expert who would think the deletion of the server data was anything less than insidious and highly suspicious,” she said. J.Tom Morgan, a former Georgia prosecutor, said destruction of the drive would not be a criminal act unless it was in violation of a protective court order (It appears no such order was requested). But it could seriously damage the defendants’ case, he said. NOW YOU SEE IT, NOW YOU DON’T It could still be possible to recover relevant information from the server. The FBI is known to have made an exact data image of the server in March when it investigated the security hole. The email that disclosed the server wipe said the state attorney general’s office was “reaching out to the FBI to determine whether they still have the image.” Atlanta FBI spokesman Stephen Emmett, responding to AP questions, would not say whether that image still exists. Nor would he say whether agents examined it to determine whether the server’s files might have been altered by unauthorized users. Other backups also appear to be gone. In the same email to plaintiffs’ attorneys, assistant state Attorney General Cristina Correia wrote that two backup servers were also wiped clean on Aug. 9, just as the lawsuit moved to federal court. FAILING TO SERVICE THE SERVER A 140-page collection of Kennesaw State emails, obtained Friday by the Coalition for Good Governments via an open records search, details the destruction of the data on all three servers and a partial and ultimately ineffective effort by Kennesaw State systems engineers to fix the main server’s security hole. As a result of the failed effort, sensitive data on Georgia’s 6.7 million voters — including social security numbers, party affiliation and birthdates — as well as passwords used by county officials to access elections management files remained exposed for months. The problem was first discovered by Atlanta security researcher Logan Lamb, who happened across it while doing online research in August 2016. He informed the election center’s director at the time, noting in an email that “there is a strong possibility your site is already compromised.” Based on his review of the emails, Lamb believes that electronic polling books could have been altered in Georgia’s biggest counties to add or drop voters or to scramble their data. Malicious hackers could have altered the templates of the memory cards used in voting machines to skew results. An attacker could even have modified “ballot-building” files to corrupt the count, said Lamb, who works at Atlanta-based Bastille Networks. But it will be impossible to know for sure unless the FBI provides a copy of the server image for analysis. Left:

                                    — Updated on Oct 26, 2017 3:20 PM EST",WATCH: Donald Trump declares opioid crisis a public health emergency," “This epidemic is a public health emergency,” Trump said. “We can be the generation that ends the opioid epidemic.” The room applauded with Trump speaking before officials from his administration, including National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins, Food and Drug Administration Director Scott Gottlieb and Special Counsel Kellyanne Conway, members of Congress, including Sen. Joe Manchin from West Virginia, and people who have lost loved ones to opioid use or who are strengthening their communities, including Rebecca Crowder from Lily’s Place, a clinic in Huntington, West Virginia that weans infants during opioid withdrawal that First Lady Melania Trump recently visited. His daughter, Ivanka Trump, and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who chairs a commission the president established to study the opioid crisis, also attended. The president stressed that solving this crisis required shared national responsibility and that the federal government was combating opioids “on all fronts.” He took no questions from the press about why he chose this strategy to stem the epidemic. “We are committed to taking additional steps under the new declaration of a public health emergency to more forcefully confront this immense national tragedy,” Gottlieb said in a statement. But the president’s action met pushback, primarily because the White House’s decision to declare this crisis as a public health emergency does not summon new funding. George Benjamin, executive director for the American Public Health Association said in a released statement that the president’s strategy “comes up short.” “Without an aggressive, comprehensive plan and significant boost in funding to prevent overdoses, assist addiction recovery and prevent new addictions, the declaration will fall far short of our country’s needs,” he said. Leana Wen, public health commissioner for Baltimore, Maryland, and a vocal advocate for expanded resources to expand addiction treatment and reduce stigma, asked in a statement why the administration offered no new funds with this declaration. “Imagine if there were hundreds of people dying from a natural disaster or from a disease such as Ebola every day—there would be no question that a declaration should take place that would have the full force of the federal government, including funding and resources, behind it,” Wen said. According to senior administration officials early Thursday, the declaration would expand telemedicine access, which is critical in rural areas, allow federal and state workers to be deployed to hard-hit communities and offer help to displaced workers. This public health emergency announcement lasts 90 days and can be extended as needed. Officials said the Trump administration is negotiating with Congress to provide additional funding. The announcement came more than two months after his Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis made its “first and most urgent recommendation” that Trump put the full weight of his office behind efforts to stop this public health epidemic in an interim report, which said an estimated 142 Americans die daily, amounting to the same death toll as September 11, 2001, every three weeks. And in 2016, 64,000 people died of drug overdose, according to preliminary data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The president had signaled multiple times that he would make this announcement, including once in August when he said opioid use amounted to a national emergency, but he never signed any formal declaration, The New York Times reported. And more than a week ago during a Rose Garden press briefing with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell at his side, Trump said he would make a big announcement on the issue. The next day, Trump’s drug czar nominee, Rep. Tom Marino, a Republican from Pennsylvania, withdrew his name to lead the Office of National Drug Control Policy following reports from the Washington Post and CBS News “60 Minutes” that he guided a 2016 law that hindered the Drug Enforcement Administration’s ability to stop illicit substances, including opioids, from flowing into the country. The DEA’s acting chief Chuck Rosenberg resigned, and Health and Human Services Director Tom Price resigned after reports revealed that he used taxpayer dollars to fly private air travel. The bipartisan commission, chaired by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, is scheduled to release its final report by Nov. 1. PBS NewsHour will update this story as it develops.
