Let me ask you - have you even read the United States Constitution? (APPLAUSE) K. KHAN: You have sacrificed nothing and no one. MARTIN: Donald Trump reacted on ABC News, which aired this morning.

npr,"July 31, 2016","Clinton, Kaine Take Economic Message To Rust Belt"," MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Hillary Clinton is wrapping up what's called a barnstorming tour this evening. She and her running mate Virginia Senator Tim Kaine took buses through the Rust Belt this weekend trying to sell their economic message and their team to blue-collar voters in a couple of key states. And yet, much of the political conversation this weekend is about the Khan family and Donald Trump. NPR's Tamara Keith is following the Clinton campaign on the bus tour this evening, and she's with us now. She's actually on the bus. Hi, Tam. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Hi. I am definitely on a moving bus right now (laughter). MARTIN: So the back and forth between Donald Trump and the Khan family - we heard about this at the top of the program, but for listeners who maybe didn't hear that, could you give us a quick sketch? KEITH: There was this powerful moment at the convention where Mr. Khan pulled out his pocket Constitution and offered it to Donald Trump. Trump was asked about this in an interview on ABC's ""This Week,"" and he questioned whether that speech had been written by the Clinton campaign, which Mr. Khan said it was not. He questioned why Mrs. Khan didn't speak. She had in another interview said, well, actually I didn't speak because I was way too emotional. Just seeing her son's picture causes her to be upset, even all these years after he was killed in Iraq. Then Donald Trump tweeted out this morning, quote, ""I was viciously attacked by Mr. Khan at the Democratic convention. Am I not allowed to respond? Hillary voted for the Iraq War not me."" Now, Hillary Clinton has also weighed in. She held a quick media availability at a place called Grandpa's Cheesebarn along the bus route here. And she was very critical of Trump, said this comes in a long line of other people or groups of people that Donald Trump has criticized. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HILLARY CLINTON: Any one of those things is so offensive. And then to launch an attack as he did on Captain Khan's mother, a gold star mother, who stood there on that stage with her husband honoring the sacrifice of their son and who has in the days since spoken out about the overwhelming emotion that any mother would feel as her son was being honored and then to have Trump do what he did - I don't know where the bounds are. I don't know where the bottom is. MARTIN: Tam, talk a little bit about where you've been over the last couple of days. Where did this campaign take the bus tour and what is the message that they're trying to sell there? KEITH: The bus tour went through Donald Trump country, essentially. It went to parts of Pennsylvania and Ohio with a large population of white working-class voters, which is exactly the voters that Donald Trump has appealed to in this campaign. And what the Clinton campaign is doing by going to those places is essentially saying that they are not at this point willing to cede those votes to Donald Trump. They believe that if people can hear their message that it will break through and that they could perhaps win those voters back. I did talk to one man at an event in Youngstown, Ohio, last night. He supports Clinton but he said a lot of his friends don't, that they're so angry about economic conditions and factory closures and other things that happened years ago that he doesn't think that they will listen to Clinton, that there's very little she could say to break through. MARTIN: Did the upcoming presidential debates come up as well over the course of those couple of days? KEITH: Yes. Donald Trump has tweeted out that he's concerned about a conflict between the NFL football schedule and the presidential debate schedule. We asked Hillary Clinton about that today. She said that the debate schedule was set long ago by a nonpartisan commission, and she has every intention of attending those debates. MARTIN: That's NPR's Tamara Keith on the bus with the Clinton campaign currently in Ohio. Tam, thanks so much. KEITH: You're welcome so much. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"July 31, 2016",Barbershop: Evaluating The Media's Role This Political Season," Joining us from Philadelphia member station WHYY was Ryan Grim, Washington bureau chief for the Huffington Post - that's a progressive online publication - Susan Glasser, editor of Politico, David Brody, chief political correspondent for the Christian Broadcasting Network - which is popular with evangelicals - and our own Michael Oreskes, senior vice president of news and the editorial director here at NPR. We've put this group together because they represent print and broadcast and so-called legacy media and new media, and also media geared toward specific audiences. And I started by asking Ryan Grim about how he saw his news organization's role in covering the campaign so far. RYAN GRIM: I mean, at the Huffington Post, we've done everything we can throughout the campaign to try to resist normalizing this candidate and to show that he's an extremist and he's kind of a unique threat to democracy, which is actually - that's a phrase that the Washington Post editorial board remarkably used I believe a week ago. Wednesday night at the Democratic National Convention, President Obama went so far as to warn about tyranny. He used the phrase homegrown demagogue. And if you step back, that's a remarkable moment. This is one major party talking about the other major party's nominee in a way that calls into question their commitment to democracy. And I think that it's about time that that is happening. But for too long, the media kind of allowed him to be treated as somebody who is a normal part of the process. MARTIN: Michael, what do you say about this? I know that you were particularly impressed with a piece by the New York Times public editor, Liz Spayd, where she says that readers who say they're not conservatives have complained that the Times is biased against the Republican nominee, and that she says that the perception that the paper has a liberal bent is very dangerous and can't continue. But she also says it's kind of reflective of really a bigger problem, that people are increasingly turning to news sources with a definite liberal or conservative bent and that's really what they're seeking. What's - first of all, what's your takeaway on the question I ask? And tell me more about why you were impressed with Liz Spayd's piece. MICHAEL ORESKES, BYLINE: Sure. I think it's very important, though, to think a lot about what happens now because everything that's happened up to now was a selection process. And you can even debate how much the media should have a role in selection. So there's a whole question about that. There's no question we have a crucial role now, and that crucial role is providing to all of the citizens of the country the information that they need to make sound decisions. In my view, which is, you know, not the universal view among journalists, our role is not to lean into or away from any particular candidate, but to lean very hard into full-throated information - to reveal whatever needs to be revealed, to explain what needs to be explained. And one of the reasons I thought that Liz Spayd's column was so important was it really highlighted the dangers of taking sides because once you start partisanizing (ph) your journalism, that's something that can last way beyond any one season. And one of the real tragedies of this election year would be if, in the end, the legacy of Donald Trump was to drive journalism even further into its corners. MARTIN: Well, you know, David, you play an interesting role because you actually do something that Liz Spayd has criticized in the sense that you both report on the candidates, but you also write opinion columns. For example, you had a column scolding people for feeling that they could judge Donald Trump's - the depth of his faith, you know, for example. Now, the fact is there are evangelicals who are not of one mind about Donald Trump. How do you see your role in that? DAVID BRODY: Well, to represent both sides. And so for example, there'll be articles that I'll write about how Donald Trump had a bad moment in Iowa - and I was referring to the time that he was mocking Ben Carson and his life story, calling him an OK doctor (laughter). So - I mean, there are certain times where he needs to be called out on certain things that he does. And at the same time, evangelicals are going about 30 to 35 percent for Donald Trump. That's an extraordinary number, and it's something I needed to explain. MARTIN: But what about - what is the challenge when you have one candidate with an extensive public record and you have another candidate with an extensive record as a public figure, but less of a record as a political actor - none, in fact - but he does have high visibility in his performance of himself, OK? How - because there - as you know, I mean, the critique of - I think of much of the legacy media from a lot of people - let's say progressives - is that there's a false equivalency being set up here, that in its effort to be fair that the legacy media is really being unfair by making equivalent what is not equivalent. SUSAN GLASSER: Can I just jump in there for a second... MARTIN: Sure, Susan. Sure you can. GLASSER: ...Because I feel like that is something we've heard from the very beginning of this. But if you actually go back and look at the record, there's been a lot of terrific reporting, important reporting, about Donald Trump - by the way, not just in this 2016 election year, but going really back decades to the beginning of his very public, very prominent career in New York in the late 1970s. It's also true that in the course of this campaign, we deployed a team of reporters to look at all of the words that he spoke in one week. We found roughly one falsehood every five minutes. Other people have done terrific work on this as well. So that's not the issue either. And... MARTIN: ...What is the issue? GLASSER: Well, I think there are a couple of things. Number one, it goes back to Trump's ability to use these tools, the same tools that you and - that we're using to have this conversation today, to his own ends. Donald Trump doesn't play by the rules of the road, of the First Amendment as it has been interpreted and expanded upon by our judiciary. He doesn't believe in the same basic sort of compact between politicians and reporters that have really governed how we cover politics in the country for a really long time. Donald Trump doesn't agree that you and I should do our jobs the way that we think we should do them. MARTIN: So - but I just... BRODY: ...I think one thing that is... MARTIN: ...David Brody? ORESKES: Go ahead, David. BRODY: Yeah, let me just say one quick thing. I think the frustration within the media - and when I say the media, I'm talking about that traditional mainstream media that we hear so much about - is that Donald Trump is defying conventional norms. And there is a Teflon quality to him. And what normally would have been - had some sort of either reaction or maybe dip in the polls or at least people paying attention to what traditional journalism brings to the table is not working this time, or hasn't worked to the degree that I think other stories would have done in the past. MARTIN: Let me stop you, though. Let me ask you, though - hold on a second, please - David, what you seem to be implying is that the media is frustrated because they are seeking a certain outcome which has not been achieved, which is to just - to stop his candidacy. And I just would question that assumption. BRODY: Yeah, that's not really what I'm saying. What I'm trying to say is that traditionally, when a above-the-fold New York Times story is run on a candidate there seems to be some sort of effect that goes with that. In this cycle, that hasn't seemed to be the case. And that's my point. MARTIN: Susan has made the point that he has, in fact, been thoroughly covered. So at this juncture, what is the task, Mike Oreskes? Is it to describe taste and tone? Is it to balance taste and tone against the conventional norms? Is it to evaluate policy? What's the job now? ORESKES: It's a truism in politics that the primary season is very different from the general election. And I think that truism is true about journalism, too. We can talk a lot about what happened in the primaries. This is a different - the clock starts over. A lot of people who haven't paid any attention now start paying attention. I think our job - I can really only speak for NPR and for public radio a bit - our job is to provide as much material and information as possible so that citizens can decide what to do. MARTIN: Ryan Grim, what do you think your job is now? Because you have said that you felt that it was the job of your organization to describe Donald Trump in a certain way. What is your job right now? GRIM: I don't think anybody disagrees with what Michael is saying. The real question, though, is which facts do you provide? You know, the media has limited resources. There's only so much time in the day for NPR to broadcast. There's only so much that we can report on the Huffington Post. So we have to pick and choose, you know, what stories we're going to write. You know, we're going to choose to highlight moderate Republicans, other Republicans who are pointing out that Donald Trump is a unique threat to democracy flirting with fascism. We're going to put those facts in front of the public. And if the public goes to the election and decides that somebody that's been described across the spectrum as a, quote unquote, ""homegrown demagogue"" is what they want, then that's what we want. You know, they're not going to cast their vote based on what we tell them to do. But we want them to go in with all of the information. In other words, if the American public decided that invading Iraq in 2003 was the right thing to do given all of the information that they had, then OK. That's what they decide to do. But the media did not present all of the different facts. So I agree with Michael, but, you know, the media often fails to provide the facts that aren't necessarily fitting into whatever narrative is being pushed. MARTIN: That was Ryan Grim of the Huffington Post. We were also joined by Susan Glasser of Politico, David Brody of the Christian Broadcasting Network and Michael Oreskes of NPR.

npr,"July 31, 2016","As The Candidates Drop By Sunday Talk Shows, 2 Big Themes Emerge"," Two big subjects popped out from the screen on this week's Sunday political talk shows: the candidates' responses to criticism leveled by grieving families, and questions about Russia's involvement in the U.S. presidential race. Khizr Khan, whose son was killed fighting for the U.S. in Iraq, spoke forcefully at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday, accusing Donald Trump of fomenting divisiveness and asking if Trump had read the Constitution. As his wife Ghazala stood silently beside him, Khan implored Trump to ""look for the words 'liberty' and 'equal protection of law.' "" On Friday, Trump taped an interview with George Stephanopoulos which aired Sunday morning on This Week. In it, he responded to the Khans' appearance at the DNC: I saw him. He was, you know, very emotional. And probably looked like — a nice guy to me. His wife, if you look at his wife, she was standing there. She had nothing to say. She probably — maybe she wasn't allowed to have anything to say. You tell me, but plenty of people have written that. She was extremely quiet and looked like she had nothing to say. A lot of people have said that. And personally, I watched him. I wish him the best of luck, George. STEPHANOPOULOS: What would you say to the father? TRUMP: Well, I would say, we have had a lot of problems with radical Islamic terrorism, that's what I'd say. We have had a lot of problems where you look at San Bernardino, you look at Orlando, you look at the World Trade Center, you look at so many different things. You look at what happened to the priest over the weekend in Paris, where his throat was cut, 85-year-old, beloved Catholic priest. You look at what happened in Nice, France, a couple of weeks ago. I would say, you gotta take a look that, because something is going on, and it's not good. (Khizr Khan has also been outspoken about extremism.) The night he taped the ABC interview, Trump also echoed his question about Ghazala Khan to Maureen Dowd of The New York Times. 
                Khizr Khan, accompanied by his wife, Ghazala Khan, speaks about their son Capt. Humayun Khan on the final night of the Democratic National Convention.

 Khizr Khan, accompanied by his wife, Ghazala Khan, speaks about their son Capt. Humayun Khan on the final night of the Democratic National Convention. Ghazala Khan, who spoke to MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell on Friday and contributed an op-ed to The Washington Post on Sunday, did not appear on the Sunday shows this morning, but her husband did. On CNN, he answered a question about a Saturday night statement from the Trump campaign, which did not address Trump's questions about Ghazala Khan but did call the Khans' son, Capt. Humayun Khan, ""a hero to our country."" ""I appreciate his response, his press release that was issued last night, confirming that he accepts my son as a hero of this country. ""But to answer your question, his policies, his practices do not reflect that he has any understanding of the basic fundamental constitutional principles of this country, what makes this country exceptional, what makes this country exceptional in the history of the mankind. ""There are principles of equal dignity, principle of liberty. He talks about excluding people, disrespecting judges, the entire judicial system, immigrants, Muslim immigrants. These are — divisive rhetoric that is totally against the basic constitutional principle."" Khan went on to say that Trump is ""incapable of empathy."" ""I want his family to counsel him, teach him some empathy. He will be a better person if he could become — but he is a black soul. And this is totally unfit for the leadership of this beautiful country."" Donald Trump isn't the only candidate who's come under criticism from the family of a fallen American. On a Fox News Sunday interview taped Saturday, Chris Wallace asked Hillary Clinton about Patricia Smith, whose son was killed in the 2012 attacks on U.S. facilities in Benghazi, Libya. Here's that exchange: WALLACE: One of the most dramatic moments in the Republican convention was when Pat Smith, the mother of Sean Smith, one of the people who died in Benghazi, stood up before the convention and blamed you for her son's death. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PAT SMITH, MOTHER OF SEAN SMITH: I blame Hillary Clinton — I blame Hillary Clinton personally for the death of my son. That's personally. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: She and the father of Tyrone Woods both say that on the day that their sons' bodies were returned to the United States, that you came up to them and you said it was all because of a video, not terrorism. Now, I know some of the other families disagree with this, and I know you deny it. The question is, why would they make that up? CLINTON: Chris, my heart goes out to both of them. Losing a child under any circumstances, especially in this case, two State Department employees, extraordinary men, both of them, two CIA contractors gave their lives protecting our countries, our values. I understand the grief and the incredible sense of loss that can motivate that. As other members of families who lost loved ones have said, that's not what they heard — I don't hold any ill feeling for someone who in that moment may not fully recall everything that was or wasn't said. NPR's Don Gonyea points out that Clinton's posture toward Patricia Smith is similar to George W. Bush's posture toward Cindy Sheehan, who protested U.S. involvement in Iraq by camping outside Bush's Texas ranch. Sheehan's son, like Humayun Khan, died in Iraq in 2004. This is from Reuters in August 2005: "" 'I grieve for every death,' Bush said as Cindy Sheehan remained camped out about 5 miles away. For six days she has been demanding Bush meet with her about her son, Casey Austin Sheehan, an Army specialist killed in combat in Baghdad in April 2004. "" 'It breaks my heart to think about a family weeping over the loss of a loved one. I understand the anguish that some feel about the death that takes place,' Bush said. But he added, 'Pulling the troops out would send a terrible signal to the enemy.' "" The other big issue from the Sunday talkers was the candidates' take on Russia and allegations it is meddling in the U.S. electoral process. Hillary Clinton, on Fox, was clear when asked about recent hacks of the Democratic National Committee: WALLACE: Do you believe that Russia is behind the hacking and release of the DNC emails? And do you think that Vladimir Putin wants to defeat you or see you defeated and Donald Trump elected president? CLINTON: Well, Chris, here's what I think we know. We know that Russian intelligence services, which is part of the Russian government which is under the firm control of Vladimir Putin, hacked into the DNC. And we know that he arranged for a lot of those emails to be released. And we know that Donald Trump has shown a very troubling willingness to back up Putin, to support Putin, whether it's saying that NATO wouldn't come to the rescue of allies if they were invaded, talking about removing sanctions from Russian officials after they were imposed by the United States and Europe together, because of Russia's aggressiveness in Crimea and Ukraine, his praise for Putin which is I think quite remarkable. On ABC, George Stephanopoulos asked Donald Trump about his relationship with Vladimir Putin. Trump answered: If our country got along with Russia, that would be a great thing. When Putin goes out and tells everybody — and you talk about a relationship, but he says Donald Trump is going to win and Donald Trump is a genius, and then I have people saying you should disavow. I said, I'm going to disavow that? But when Putin says good things and when we have a possibility of having a good relationship with Russia ... STEPHANOPOULOS: But if we have a good relationship ... TRUMP: — I think ... (CROSSTALK) STEPHANOPOULOS: — his annexation of Crimea. TRUMP: I'm not going to be mean to anybody. George, you know me pretty well. I don't bow, OK. I don't bow. Trump returned to Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, later in the conversation: Well, look, you know, I have my own ideas. He's not going into Ukraine, OK? Just so you understand. He's not going to go into Ukraine, all right? You can mark it down and you can put it down, you can take it anywhere you want. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, he's already there, isn't he? TRUMP: OK, well, he's there in a certain way, but I'm not there yet. You have Obama there. And frankly, that whole part of the world is a mess under Obama, with all the strength that you're talking about and all of the power of NATO and all of this, in the meantime, he's going where — he takes — takes Crimea, he's sort of — I mean ... STEPHANOPOULOS: But you said you might recognize that. TRUMP: I'm going to take a look at it. But, you know, the people of Crimea, from what I've heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were. And you have to look at that, also. On Meet the Press, Wikileaks founder Julian Assange would not say whether the DNC emails his organization released came from Russian hacking, but he did say Wikileaks would accept information from a foreign government if they could verify its accuracy.

npr,"July 31, 2016",Retired Gen. John Allen Weighs In On Campaign With Hillary Clinton Endorsement," RACHEL MARTIN, BYLINE: General, thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us. JOHN ALLEN: Great to be with you today. MARTIN: You have spent a lifetime in the military being apolitical. That's what being in the military is all about. ALLEN: That's right - exactly right. MARTIN: What has compelled you to say, in this moment, that Hillary Clinton should be the next commander-in-chief? ALLEN: You know, this world is full of challenges right now. And in and of itself, I believe in her. You know, the United States is that transformational power in the world today. But it doesn't do it on its own. It does it through the mechanism of alliances and relationships. And she gets that. She understands that. She wants to reinforce that. And language that would seem to diminish the importance of NATO or to pull out some of the fundamental tenets of what NATO is, Article 5 - an attack on one of us is an attack on all of us... MARTIN: Which Donald Trump has suggested... ALLEN: Yes. I mean... MARTIN: ...At least re-evaluating those alliances. ALLEN: ...That kind of rhetoric erodes the relationships inside NATO. It erodes its credibility. She just gets this. She understands it. That's why I came out because this was a moment where the choices are very stark. And supporting her at this moment to be the president of the United States seemed to me to be, frankly, my duty. MARTIN: During the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, I mean, there was an overwhelming sense of doom. The message was the world is violent and dangerous. Donald Trump is the guy to steer America through that. Do you understand the sense from people who support Donald Trump that it is a scary world? When you look at how ISIS, in particular, has metastasized and the threats seem to just be popping up all over - do you get that fear on the other side? Do you understand it? ALLEN: Well, of course, I do. The challenges we face today from ISIL, from Russia, from China, from Iran, from North Korea - I don't want to add to people's fears here - those are real and immediate concerns for the United States of America. But we're going - only be able to handle these in relationship to our partners - you know, the strength of NATO, the strength of our relationships in East Asia, the strengths of our relationships with our Arab partners in the gulf, reinforcing the global coalition to counter ISIL. All of those things require leadership. And all of those things, in the end, give us some capacity to resolve or at least to meet these challenges. MARTIN: President Obama, in his address, said that Hillary Clinton can finish the job. Those were his words when talking about the threat from ISIS. But how? I mean, what would she do that would be so different than what his administration has done? - which is also a criticism that you hear from Donald Trump. What would she do differently? And whatever they have done hasn't ameliorated the threat. ALLEN: Well, I think, you know, a couple of things, and the strategy is working. Daesh is being defeated on the ground in Iraq and Syria. It's going to take a while. We've always said that. MARTIN: Daesh is the Arabic word for... ALLEN: ...The so-called Islamic State. MARTIN: ...Islamic State. ALLEN: The idea of countering the messaging and stopping the flow of foreign fighters and strangling the finances and constricting its surface area - all of those things are having effect. It took a while for it to happen. We took those guys head-on about 18 months ago. And it takes a while to reverse strategic momentum. And that strategic momentum is substantially reversed, and I think we'll be able to continue that. MARTIN: Lastly, Donald Trump has, at some points during the campaign, suggested that if he disagreed with generals about a particular national security issue that he would get them in line - that he would somehow override them. As you have watched and listened to his rhetoric, what has struck you the most - concerned you the most? ALLEN: Well, I have to tell you, one of the reasons that I'm doing this is the horror that I experienced the first time I heard him tell the American public that he would convince the generals to use the American military as an instrument of torture. This is going to create a civil military crisis that has never occurred in this country before. And words are windows into people's souls. The implication that, potentially over the objections of our military and civilian leadership, our military could be used as an instrument of torture or an instrument to track down and murder the families of terrorists, that's a problem. That's a problem. And when our military may find itself in a situation where it has to say that is an illegal order issued by the president of the United States, this is a civil military crisis. MARTIN: Retired Marine Corps General John Allen, thank you so much for taking the time. ALLEN: Rachel, great to be with you today. Thanks.

npr,"July 31, 2016",Donald Trump Campaign To Focus On Black Voter Outreach," OMAROSA MANIGAULT: Well, it is a 76-page strategy, so I - in my three minutes that I have with you, I'll just say that it is important for Mr. Trump to make sure that all folks are included in his vision for this country and included, I mean, improving the conditions in the inner cities, particularly where I grew up in Youngstown, Ohio, where the average income is about $13,000, where unemployment is at an all-time high, particularly for young men under 30 - black men under 30 - creating jobs and creating the opportunities for people to get training for those jobs and then making sure that those jobs are not shipped overseas. And so Donald is very concerned about the economic conditions, particularly of African-Americans in this country. HU: On this topic of inclusiveness, on a lot of fronts, Donald Trump has staked out what sounds to many as a xenophobic or anti-immigrant position. He's even won over the support of some white nationalists. So how will you convince people of color to swing his way? MANIGAULT: Let's be clear - Donald Trump says things that, you know, challenge people's thoughts on race and race relations in this country. And they are, at times, racial. But the charges that he - or any of those things are not substantiated. The truth of the matter is that Donald Trump has been in the public eye for years and years and years. And we didn't hear these accusations until he decided to run to become president of the United States, and then you hear his opponents saying these things. HU: What kind of advice are you giving Donald Trump about inclusiveness? MANIGAULT: Well, a lot of what I do with Mr. Trump is really guide him in terms of what's happening in the communities. He had no idea, until he started running, how many young black men and women were dying in the streets of Chicago. And so those are issues that I not only advise him on - that these are things that have to stop, that we have to find ways to make sure that the value of black lives in inner cities around this country is elevated. And so yeah, those are things that I talk with him about and that are important to his campaign. HU: What Trump policies would solve those problems? MANIGAULT: Job creation is going to be key. If you start to create opportunities for people, you'll see the number of people who are on welfare, the number of people who just feel like they have no hope - that number goes down. And his policies that really focus on businesses will help create jobs that will give us the opportunity to be self-reliant and to make a difference. HU: Omarosa, let me ask a little bit about you. You were a Democrat until joining the Trump campaign, I understand, and have supported Barack Obama in the past. So what explains your shift, personally? MANIGAULT: Well, I think it's a great question. And, in fact, a big portion of what I'm doing as African-American outreach director is appealing to Democrats. I was - I worked for the Clintons. Unfortunately, it was during the impeachment time. And then I made the very tough decision, when both Senator Clinton and Senator Barack Obama were running, to support Barack Obama. And many in the Clinton camp weren't very pleased with me, even back then. But when Donald Trump entered this race, I knew that a lot of his policies aligned with what would improve my community. HU: What will you be doing between now and Election Day? MANIGAULT: As a Baptist minister, I still believe in the power of the pulpit and going into black churches, going into barbershops and beauty shops, going into homes and having very intimate town halls. So I'm very excited, but I only have 100 days to get this done. (LAUGHTER) MANIGAULT: And I'm up for the challenge (laughter). HU: Omarosa Manigault is directing African-American outreach for the Donald Trump campaign. Omarosa, thanks. MANIGAULT: Thank you. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"July 31, 2016","Intelligence Officials Share Concerns, But 'Will Step Up' To Continue With Briefings"," Good morning. JOHN MCLAUGHLIN: Hello. Good morning, Elise. HU: First, why do presidential candidates, some who aren't elected officials, get intelligence briefings? And what kind of briefings do they get? MCLAUGHLIN: Well, this tradition goes back to President Harry Truman, who decided, when Dwight Eisenhower was running for president and Adlai Stevenson back in 1952, that they needed to have some sense for what was going on in the world of foreign policy, given the tumult of that time. So it's been a tradition since then. And the theory is that one of these two people will become president of the United States. And so fairly early on in their candidacy after nomination, they should get some kind of a briefing on what the government, particularly from the intelligence point of view, thinks is going on in the world. HU: The Washington Post quoted a senior intelligence official who said he would not participate in any session with Donald Trump. What are you hearing from your friends in the intelligence community on this topic? MCLAUGHLIN: I guess I would say this - my understanding and my experience is that intelligence professionals will step up to this and do it. The director of central intelligence, James Clapper, spoke on this matter - senior intelligence official in the United States - and he basically said we have teams ready to go and do this. I know there's a lot of controversy about both candidates. But, you know, the intelligence ethic here is you stay out of politics. HU: Do you personally feel comfortable with Donald Trump getting briefed? MCLAUGHLIN: I do in the sense. You know, I'd be among those who would say I think some of the things he said have been close to disqualifying. I mean, some of the things he said about our fidelity to our alliances to countries in NATO are, to me, shocking things coming from a presidential candidate. But on the other hand, if I were directing this, I would not have reservations about having him briefed. In fact, I would think it is all the more important that he be briefed. HU: We also can't forget that Hillary Clinton was just recently reprimanded by the FBI for her quote, ""careless handling of sensitive material."" Do you share concerns about her? MCLAUGHLIN: No. My take on Hillary Clinton would be what she did with the email server was a mistake, and she's acknowledged that. On the other hand, this is a person who is so accustomed to intelligence briefings. I mean, she had a daily briefer every day who briefed her as secretary of state on essentially what the president was getting at the same time, that I would think her posture in these briefings would be more in the mode of now where were we? - I wouldn't have any reservations. HU: And finally, are there dangers to not briefing candidates? MCLAUGHLIN: I think there are. The danger of not briefing them is that on the day they walk into office, it is, all of a sudden, upon them that there are these complexities they didn't understand. Things don't get to the president's desk unless they're hard. Someone else deals with all the easy stuff. By the time it gets to the president, it's complicated, and the choices are almost always all bad. So the sooner they start to understand and get a sense of flavor for that, the better. HU: John McLaughlin is former acting director of the CIA. Thanks for speaking with us. MCLAUGHLIN: You bet. Thank you, Elise. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"July 30, 2016",Barbershop: Speechwriters Speak On The RNC And DNC," MARY KATE CARY: Hey. MARTIN: Also here with us, Jeff Nussbaum. He's a former speechwriter for vice presidents Joe Biden and Al Gore. He's now a partner at West Wing Writers. We hear he specializes in humor. So, Jeff, you know, we're hoping you'll perk us up at some point today. JEFF NUSSBAUM: I'll do my best. MARTIN: OK. And from the Virginia Heritage Foundation studio, Barbara Perry. She's director of presidential studies at the University of Virginia's Miller Center. Welcome to you, Barbara Perry. BARBARA PERRY: Great to be with you. MARTIN: So it's good to have all of you. So one of the things that many people have already commented on is the stark difference in tone between the Republicans and the Democrats this year, that the Democrats focused more on optimistic message, while the RNC took a much darker view of where the country is right now. Hillary Clinton's speech on Thursday night sort of stuck to this message, and we're going to play a little clip from that. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HILLARY CLINTON: Now, we are clear-eyed about what our country is up against, but we are not afraid. We will rise to the challenge just as we always have. We will not build a wall. Instead, we will build an economy where everyone who wants a good job can get one. MARTIN: So, Jeff, I'm going to start with you because you were just in Philly. And I don't even know if you got a chance to drop your bag, so thanks so much for coming in. Tell me about the tone that the Democrats were trying to strike here. What was the intention? Do you think they achieved it? NUSSBAUM: Sure. The goal was to do several things. And Hillary Clinton's speech brought them all together in the final speech on the final night. The first was to paint Donald Trump as risky. The second was to describe who Hillary was before her public life, and then the final night really brought it all together with this theme of stronger together. And that's what you heard in her speech. MARTIN: OK. Mary Kate, what do you think? CARY: I agree that Donald Trump - that last night at the Republican convention - gave a very dark speech. My critique was not so much about his assessment of where the United States is right now. Everything he said was well-documented. The darkness to me came with him saying I alone can fix it and some of the other statements like that. The crime rate will go down. That was what was frightening to me. So I did think it was smart for Hillary Clinton to do the opposite and go in a different direction because if she's not painting herself as a change-maker, which I don't think she did, then the next alternative is to take down Donald Trump and make him the scary alternative. And she was able to do that. NUSSBAUM: And, by the way, I alone can fix it teed up exactly what Democrats wanted to say because it provided such a clear contrast between we the people versus I alone. MARTIN: Let me play a little bit of Donald Trump's speech for people who may not have heard it. I'll just play a clip. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: The irresponsible rhetoric of our president who has used the pulpit of the presidency to divide us by race and color has made America a more dangerous environment than, frankly, I have ever seen and anybody in this room has ever watched or seen. This administration... MARTIN: Barbara, what about you? And as the historian of the group, I was wondering if that tonal difference also struck you or is this something that tends to happen, we just don't notice it as much because stylistically they were so different? Is it that the party in power tends to make the case that, you know, things are pretty good and that the party that's not in power tends to make the case that things are terrible, and you have to change it? PERRY: Well, that typically is a way to go about this. But I think what struck people so much, and I noticed a lot of the commentators were pointing out as well, that the Democrats were able to take this territory that was seated by the Republican convention - and maybe the Republican Party at this time if it is indeed being led by Donald Trump - and that is the patriotism and optimism element that the Democrats have not really able been able to hold onto since about 1960 when President Kennedy ran and in his speech talked about the new frontier in Los Angeles. So this kind of uplifting, upbeat view that might've seemed corny for sophisticated Democrats to take on and the fact that Ronald Reagan had so captured that element for the Republican Party meant that it was sort of hard for Democrats or maybe it just didn't feel second nature to them to take up that cause. But now everything - it's like a perfect storm has formed for them to take up that theme. And I thought they did a superb job at expanding on it in Philadelphia. MARTIN: Mary Kate, I know that people talked about Hillary Clinton's tone some, you know, particularly conservative commentators talked about her tone as they have in the past. They say, you know - they find her shrill, etc. I was just curious about his tone and his presentation. CARY: You know, the thing that, as a speechwriter, sort of speech writing 101 would be tell a lot of stories, make it a speech that no one else could possibly deliver because it is full of stories from your life and your view capturing your voice in time. And none of the Trump family speeches, I thought, necessarily did that. There weren't a lot of stories about Donald Trump. That was one of the problems with Melania's speech - a lot of platitudes, a lot of generalities. And, in his case, he didn't really talk about his journey and how he got to this place and he - and when he said I alone can fix it and things like that, that wasn't a policy solution. That wasn't details that people wanted to hear, which I think would have been very comforting to Republicans like me. And that's where I think he missed the opportunity to reassure people and grow the tent. MARTIN: We mentioned President Obama. So I did want to ask that this was a - an important moment for both Obama that many people - the speeches given by both the first lady and the president really struck a lot of people. And this was their last hurrah, if you will, on a big stage. I think it's fair to say. I mean - I wanted to ask all of you, what do you think their legacy is as orators? What do you think that - when we think back to the Obama era what - do you think that they had an impact? And I apologize for putting them both together, but we heard both of them this week, and you can talk about either or both. Mary Kate, I'm going to ask you. CARY: Let's do one each. The Michelle Obama, I thought, hit it out of the ballpark. I didn't agree with everything she said, but it was well-written, well-delivered, and it was the best speech I think she's ever given in her life. And sort of like Cal Ripken going out on top there, you know (laughter). I think she was terrific. For Barack Obama, his rhetorical legacy to me is a mixed bag. In some ways, when he gets fired up and ready to roll, I think it is spectacular. He sounds like no other president in American history. It's highly motivating to the people who are listening to him, and he's - that's his A-game. The flipside is for eight years now my pet peeve has been when he says in America that's not who we are. And to me, that means anybody who disagrees with him on a policy is somehow un-American. And that is very divisive to me in a very subtle way, and he's continued to do it all eight years. And I think that's - I'm glad to see that part ending. I thought his speech Thursday night was probably one of the best he's ever given, and it was his attempt to define his legacy. He'd probably deny that. But I think he did a good job with what he had to work with. MARTIN: Jeff, what do you think? NUSSBAUM: He has this interesting combination where he is able to be a inspirer-in-chief, while also being an educator-in-chief. And I would actually disagree with Mary Kate a little bit because I think that he, more than most actually, has what I think is almost - I almost don't want to see him do it as much where he actually explains the other side's argument to you. And I think he does it relatively honestly before making his argument. So there is a little bit of that law professor, too. So I think if you're weaving together the strands of sort of the pulpit plus the law professor plus the, you know - plus being able to concede an argument to make an argument, you have this really unique rhetorical braid that he's mastered. And then I will just say about Michelle - her speech was masterful, and I think it will be a master class in how to deliver a speech in an arena. MARTIN: Want me to play a little of it? I'll play a little. Here you go. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MICHELLE OBAMA: You see, Hillary understands that the president is about one thing and one thing only. It's about leaving something better for our kids. That's how we've always moved this country forward by all of us coming together on behalf of our children. Folks who volunteer to coach that team, to teach that Sunday school class because they know it takes a village. MARTIN: What is it that struck you about that? What is it that you think was so effective? NUSSBAUM: Well, I think, first of all, she got up there, and she's not a politician. And she didn't try to be a politician. She spoke as a mother, a friend, you know, she spoke as a parent. She spoke as someone who's passionate about America's children. And I will say, although we are hearing applause in that, when she was going through the meat of her speech, that was one where you could just hear a pin drop throughout. MARTIN: Barbara, what about you? How would you describe Barack Obama's impact on or to you? How would you - and know, I hate to sort of comparison because that's, like, irrelevant. I mean, everybody is in their own historical moment, right? And so, you know, comparing Barack Obama to Woodrow Wilson, you know, what's the purpose of that? But just - how would you sort of describe this president's legacy and it's - particularly from a rhetorical standpoint? PERRY: I thought it was so fascinating that he was speaking this past week at the convention exactly 12 years to the day that he burst on to the scene at the 2004 Democratic National Convention with his speech about having a United States of America. And so I think to Mary Kate's point about when he says that's not who we are in America, I think that that's what he's trying to say. He's trying to think in terms of a United States of America, and that's a theme throughout our history, that because we all come from someplace else except for those natives who are here, we have always tried to create an American creed that everyone can espouse and believe in. So I think he was attempting to do that 12 years ago. I think he has been attempting to do that throughout his presidency. But the fact that Donald Trump has come so far indicates that he's not always been successful, but in terms of looking at him over the history of the presidency, I think he will go down in presidential history with the great orators of John Kennedy, of Franklin Roosevelt, of Ronald Reagan and maybe there even some touches of Lincoln. I think he's really lived up to that heritage. MARTIN: That was from the Virginia Heritage Foundation studio Barbara Perry. She's director of presidential studies at the University of Virginia's Miller Center. Here with us in our studios in Washington, D.C., Jeff Nussbaum. He's a principal at West Wing Writers, a former speechwriter for vice presidents Al Gore and Joe Biden. And Mary Kate Cary, former speechwriter for George H. W. Bush and a columnist for U.S. News and World Report. Thank you all so much for joining us. CARY: Thanks. NUSSBAUM: Thanks. PERRY: Great to be with you. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"July 30, 2016","This Week In Hacks: The Democrats, Russia And Trump"," MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Even by the strange standards of this long, strange election season, this past week has stood out. First came word of a Kremlin conspiracy - Russia trying to meddle in U.S. politics by hacking into the servers of the Democratic National Committee. And while people were still digesting that, Donald Trump weighed in on Wednesday with this. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. MARTIN: Trump was talking about Hillary Clinton's private email server. He later said he was being sarcastic, but not before sending the national security establishment into a tailspin. And then, just as the work week was winding down, came news of more hacks. So we thought this would be a good time to take a breath and sort through what we actually know and what we don't. So we've called our national security correspondent Mary Louise Kelly for that. Mary Louise, thanks so much for joining us. MARY LOUISE KELLY, BYLINE: My pleasure, Michel. MARTIN: So the DNC confirmed that it was hacked yesterday. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which raises money for House Democrats, said it's been hacked. Do we know that Russia is behind this? KELLY: I would characterize - at least the evidence that has been made public - as powerful, but not definitive. The Kremlin has denied involvement. However, U.S. cybersecurity firms that have gone through the forensic evidence here say, no question, this is Russian security services. And privately, U.S. intelligence officials will tell you the same thing. The White House has been very careful not to finger Russia. Let me play you a little bit. This is the director of national intelligence, Jim Clapper, speaking this week out at the Aspen Security Forum. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JIM CLAPPER: Don't think we're quite ready yet to make a call on attribution. We all know there are just a few usual suspects out there. KELLY: Just a few usual suspects out there, he says. But you will notice he didn't name any other possible suspects. MARTIN: So is the reluctance to come right out and identify Russia - is that because they really don't know or are there diplomatic or political considerations involved? KELLY: Jim Clapper was asked that very question, and what he said was it's a little bit of both. The only time that the U.S. has directly laid the blame on another country for a cyberattack - it was two years ago, the Sony attack. The White House came out and said that was North Korea. There is no downside, though. The U.S. doesn't have diplomatic relations with North Korea. If you look at Russia, there is, of course, this complicated relationship. The U.S. and Russia are trying to find ways to work together all over the world - in Syria, for example. You can imagine the blowback if there's this huge war of words. On the other hand, there are consequences to not reacting. So these are all the considerations that are in play right now. MARTIN: What would be the relationship, though, between Russian intelligence and WikiLeaks, which did release this information and said explicitly that they did so in order to harm former Secretary of State Clinton's political prospects? KELLY: Certainly, there is no love lost, either between WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and Clinton or between the Kremlin and Clinton. I mean, President Putin has come out and said that he does not like Hillary Clinton. And he's come out and said relatively nice things about Donald Trump. And, of course, it's always in WikiLeaks' interests to keep itself on the front pages. WikiLeaks' mission is to put information out there that would otherwise not be in the public eye. And certainly, this fits what they say they're trying to do. MARTIN: Before we let you go, what do we know about these reports of yet another attack, this time on computers of the Clinton campaign? KELLY: The Clinton campaign says a data program that they used to conduct voter analysis was compromised. But they say this was a DNC - a Democratic National Committee - program, and that that hack was part of the DNC hack we all already knew about and have known about since June. So this is not - to be clear, this is not yet another separate attack. The Clinton campaign says its own emails, computers don't appear to have been targeted. That said, every time there's another little twist or little turn, it raises questions about how big all of this is. Is this isolated episodes? Is this evidence coming to light of some big campaign coordinated by Russia to target U.S. politics? And if so, what's the goal? And who's directing it? And what other shoes might drop? MARTIN: That's NPR's Mary Louise Kelly. Mary Louise, thanks so much. KELLY: My pleasure. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"July 30, 2016","Trump Responds To Slain Soldier's Father, Who Appeals To GOP Leaders"," Updated at 6:30 p.m. ET with a reaction from Hillary Clinton provided by her campaign. In one of the most powerful moments at the Democratic National Convention, a Muslim father of a fallen U.S. soldier took the stage with his wife beside him and spoke directly to Donald Trump. That father, Khizr Khan, condemned the Republican presidential nominee for proposing a ban on Muslims entering the United States. ""Let me ask you, have you even read the United States Constitution? I will gladly lend you my copy,"" he asked Trump, pulling a copy of the document out of his suit coat. ""Look for the words 'liberty' and 'equal protection of law.'"" Khan's son, Humayun Khan, was an Army captain. In 2004, the 27-year-old was killed by a suicide bomber in Iraq after having warned his fellow soldiers to stand back. He was awarded the Bronze Star and Purple Heart posthumously. Khan told Trump that Arlington cemetery is filled with soldiers of ""all faiths, genders and ethnicities."" ""You have sacrificed nothing and no one,"" Khan said. Trump has now responded. In an interview with New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd Friday night, Trump didn't zero in on Khan's accusations but rather on his wife, Ghazala Khan, who stood beside her husband silently. His response to Dowd was brief. ""I'd like to hear his wife say something,"" Trump said. Trump expanded on that sentiment in an interview with ABC News Saturday. There comes a time in the history of a nation where an ethical, moral stand has to be taken regardless of the political cost. Khizr Khan, in a plea to Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell ""If you look at his wife, she was standing there,"" Trump said. ""Maybe she wasn't allowed to have anything to say, you tell me."" In an interview on MSNBC the previous night, Ghazala Khan explained why she chose to remain silent on stage. ""I cannot see my son's picture. I cannot even come in the room where his pictures are,"" she said. ""That's why when I saw the picture on my back, I couldn't take it and I controlled myself at that time. So, it is very hard."" Her husband added that she served as his ""coach"" while writing the speech and said she gave him the strength to speak on stage. ""Forty years of marriage has brought us in a position where we are strength for one another,"" Khan said. ""Her being there was the strength so I could hold my composure. I am much weaker than she is in such matters."" In a statement this afternoon, Hillary Clinton said: ""I was very moved to see Ghazala Khan stand bravely and with dignity in support of her son on Thursday night. And I was very moved to hear her speak, bravely and with dignity, about her son's life and ultimate sacrifice he made for his country last night."" Khizr Khan, in his comments to MSNBC, added that his remarks at the DNC were ""only half of the speech."" The other half, he said, is for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan. ""There is so much at stake and I appeal to both of those leaders, this is the time,"" Khan said. ""There comes a time in the history of a nation where an ethical, moral stand has to be taken regardless of the political cost."" He added that no one has been able to convince Trump otherwise on his views of Muslims and other immigrants. In that Saturday ABC News interview, Trump was also asked to respond to Khizr Khan's assertion that Trump has sacrificed nothing. The GOP nominee first asked if Clinton's speech writers scripted Khan's remarks (Khan has claimed to have rejected such help), then said, ""I think I've made a lot of sacrifices. I work very, very hard. I've created thousands and thousands of jobs."" He added that he, along with others, was ""very responsible"" for getting the New York City Vietnam Veterans Memorial built. According to the Washington Post, Trump attended only a few of the 20 planning meetings for the memorial. Trump's views on Muslims also remain unchanged. When asked how he would respond to Khan in general, he said: ""We've had a lot of problems with radical Islamic terrorism, that's what I'd say.""

npr,"July 30, 2016",5 Takeaways From The Democratic National Convention," The Democratic National Convention is over. Here are some of the big takeaways from a week in Philadelphia that had more suspense and drama than expected. Just like Barack Obama's two conventions, this one was flawlessly choreographed. Even the revolt of the Bernie Bros had a more-or-less happy ending. The speakers, the videos, and even the entertainment were all designed to drive the message of optimism and inclusion, hour after hour, day after day. The Democrats even had a lot more ""showbiz"" than Donald Trump promised but might not have quite delivered. The pacing was also effective. The first two days were all about locking down the base and the lineup of speakers on Monday and Tuesday was what you'd expect at a Democratic convention. But the last two days presented the Democrats as the ""big tent"" party; the podium on Wednesday and Thursday was filled with emissaries to the other side — former Reagan White House staffers, the former Republican mayor of New York City, retired military leaders, and the families of police officers killed in the line of duty. Donald Trump has given the Democrats a lot of openings and they tried to take advantage of every single one of them last week. They appropriated the rhetoric and imagery of patriotism and American exceptionalism, something that used to be a Republican franchise. 
                Audience members wave American flags as Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton speaks on the last day of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia on July 28.

 Audience members wave American flags as Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton speaks on the last day of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia on July 28. From the chants of ""U.S.A! U.S.A!"" to the huge American flags waving during the speeches of retired military officers supporting Clinton, the Democratic Party is arguing that it is the more patriotic party. Speaker after speaker seemed to be sending the message that it is not American to build a wall, bar an entire religion from entering the country, and denigrate people based on their looks or disabilities. Presidential elections are supposed to be won by the candidate who is more optimistic and future-oriented. Donald Trump is trying to send that bit of conventional wisdom to the scrap heap. But the Democrats are still betting that hope, love and optimism sells better than gloom, doom and fear. Many people were expecting Hillary Clinton to offer more of herself in her speech. But Clinton is a guarded, cautious politician and rarely shows big crowds a peek of the person who can be warm and engaging one-on-one and in small groups. 
                Hillary Clinton delivers an acceptance speech framing herself as a workhorse on the last day of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia on July 28.

 Hillary Clinton delivers an acceptance speech framing herself as a workhorse on the last day of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia on July 28. Her speech was a more polished, even sometimes soaring version of her usual stump speech but any glimpses of the ""real"" Hillary Clinton were just slivers. Yes, she sweats the details of policy because it matters to her and yes, she cares more about the ""service"" part of public service more than the ""public"" part, but voters looking for a revealing insight to help them relate to her didn't get one. There were no new insights or even new anecdotes. Sometimes her voice was modulated; sometimes she was lecturing. But she did touch all the themes of the convention and she used humor when she went after Trump. Instead of reinventing herself, she embraced her brand. She's steady and ready — a workhorse not a show horse. And, yes, she's been around a long time. ""Sometimes the people at this podium are new to the national stage,"" she said. ""I am not one of those people."" So much has been said about how far to the left the Democratic Party has moved. And that's true. But there was something else happening in Philadelphia. The agenda was liberal, but the rhetoric and imagery were conservative. If Donald Trump is laying a wrecking ball to the Republican Party, the Democrats are assuming there will be plenty of refugees — defense hawks, suburban women, moderate Republicans and independents — looking for a new home. Both parties are responding to a growing nationalist sentiment. In Philadelphia, the Democrats were trying to develop a new kind of multi-ethnic nationalism, more inclusive and welcoming than Trump's white identity politics. The Democrats had a great convention. Hillary Clinton's speech was solid if not spectacular. But the next day's GDP report — only 1.9 percent growth in the second quarter — was a dose of reality. The number of people who think the country is on the wrong track is close to 70 percent. Hillary Clinton is still enormously unpopular. And third terms are historically very hard to get. Only 100 days left until Election Day. NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor ",http://www.npr.org/488031365
npr,"July 30, 2016",Pitching A 'Clintonville' Protest During The Democratic Convention," As tens of thousands of politicians, party delegates and protesters swept through the City of Brotherly Love this week for the Democratic National Convention, dozens of homeless Philadelphians and out-of-towners pitched tents on a grassy lot. They were part of a protest over the four days of the convention organized by Cheri Honkala, a Philadelphia-based activist with the Poor People's Economic Human Rights Campaign.

 Boarded-up buildings and empty lots dot the Kensington neighborhood, which was once a manufacturing hub of Philadelphia. She put together a similar demonstration during Pope Francis' visit to Philadelphia last year, calling it ""The Church of the Poor."" This time, Honkala set up camp in Kensington, a Philadelphia neighborhood that was once a manufacturing hub, and named the tent city ""Clintonville,"" harkening back to the ""Hooverville"" camps of the Great Depression during President Herbert Hoover's administration. There's currently no Clinton in the White House, but Honkala said the camp's name was a critique of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and of President Bill Clinton's bid to ""end welfare as we have come to know it"" by signing a reform law that put in place work requirements and limits on cash assistance. The goal of this protest, she explained, was to draw more attention to families who are living below the poverty line and struggling to survive. Volunteers created temporary homes in an open space with used furniture left in dumpsters and other castaways from Philadelphia's more well-to-do areas. ""Just a mile away, you can find people throwing away nice couches and chairs,"" said Honkala, who ran as the Green Party's vice presidential candidate in 2012. For Philadelphia resident Dee Snyder, Clintonville was less about activism than shelter. After she and her two adult children were evicted from their apartment, Snyder spent days scrambling to escape the hot and stormy weather and to find a place to sleep. Homeless shelters, she said, were out of the question.

 Volunteers dismantle the ""Clintonville"" campsite on the last day of the Democratic National Convention. ""They don't take dogs,"" explained Snyder, 62, who owns two. ""I don't want to get rid of them. We've had them for ten years. You don't just give them away."" Her son eventually found the tent city set up in a vacant lot about seven miles north of the convention arena. They slept on tattered mattresses under a blue tarp held up by makeshift wooden frames. ""We were told we could stay through the storm,"" she said. ""So we have to ride out the storm until things get figured out."" During the day, many of the Clintonville demonstrators took their activism to the streets, marching and participating in other protests, including a ""fart-in"" organized by Honkala. Others with young children or unable to walk in the heat stayed behind, trying to cool off in the shade next to piles of canned food. Sandra Rivera, a protest organizer working with Honkala, pushed her one-year-old daughter around the camp in a stroller. She questioned whether the $60 million a local fundraising committee was expected to raise to host the DNC was being put to good use. ""I want to see those millions that they promised for schools,"" she said.

npr,"July 30, 2016",DNC Wraps Up A Week In Philadelphia," RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott. SIMON: Do the Democrats look united to you? ELVING: Well, considering we're talking about Democrats, yes. You know, it's a relative term. But polls do show that Clinton is getting a very high percentage of the Democratic vote, including the vast majority of the Bernie Sanders supporters. They're getting on board now. It sometimes seems that - or seemed that the Sanders folks who were not getting on board were all present in Philly. And some of them were quite vocal, even in the convention hall itself. But on the numbers and in the main, yes, the Democrats look united. SIMON: Michelle Obama, who opened the convention with that eloquent, heart-piercing speech, was criticized in 2008 when she said, quote, ""for the first time in my adult life, I'm proud of my country."" But this week, she said, don't let anyone ever tell you that this country isn't great, that somehow we need to make it great again because this, right now, is the greatest country on Earth. What changed? ELVING: To some degree, it's Michelle Obama. She has become much more politic in the things that she says. And to some degree, it's the country that's changed. You know, I heard a young Hillary supporter this week saying how much the party had embraced diversity just in her political lifetime, in terms not only of race and ethnicity but language, immigrant status. And it's - especially in the terms of the LGBTQ community, it's really been leaps and bounds in less than eight years. And this young woman, coincidentally, said she felt really patriotic and proud of her country for the first time in her life. SIMON: So did the Democrats, to you - seem to you to be consciously trying to take over what we think of as some traditionally Republican appeals with, you know, generals and USA, USA and waving flags? ELVING: Oh, yes, they did and flags the size of the ones you see sometimes over car dealerships along the freeway trying to get your attention. There were very strong postures on defense - General John Allen on stage with 37 Iraq and Afghanistan veterans - lots of talk also about family and faith. SIMON: Bernie Sanders won more than 12 million votes in the primaries. Is Hillary Clinton now obliged to conspicuously adopt some of his positions? ELVING: Not obliged in any legal or technical sense but politically, yes. And certainly she has - certainly minimum wage, college costs and college debt. The trade pact known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, TPP, which was getting so much protest in Philadelphia, that is something too she has backed off that she had supported for quite a while. SIMON: Is there any reason to think that when Donald Trump seemed to invite Russian hackers to hack into Hillary Clinton's emails, particularly the State Department emails - he said later that was just sarcasm - did he touch some kind of third rail in politics? ELVING: It surely would have been so in the Cold War era, if you think about the '60s, '70s, even into the 1980s. For any prime candidate, certainly a Democratic candidate, to have said such a thing would have been seen as a fatal blow. But we are - are supposedly in a post-Cold War environment. Are we still or has Vladimir Putin brought on a new Cold War? And it would probably make a difference if Donald Trump continued to or stopped saying so many things about closer ties with Russia and closer ties with Vladimir Putin. So we're going to have to see how this one plays out in the weeks ahead. SIMON: NPR's Ron Elving, thanks so much for being with us. ELVING: Thank you, Scott. Copyright © 2016 NPR.

npr,"July 30, 2016",A Look At Where Bernie Sanders' Movement Goes From Here," JONATHAN TASINI: It's a pleasure to be with you, Scott. SIMON: Let me put you on the spot first. Like Senator Sanders, are you going to vote for Hillary Clinton? TASINI: I follow my candidate. We are, I think, a united front, or certainly most people feel very strongly that Donald Trump is a threat to the nation. He must be defeated. SIMON: Has she moved your way on a few issues? What's your change of heart? TASINI: Well, there's no question that frankly Hillary Clinton took positions that she never had before because of this political movement. If you look at her opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which she had previously repeatedly called the gold standard, she now says she's against it. She supports now a hike in the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. Prior to that, she did not support that. Other issues that you could see, at least in the Democratic Party platform, they're there entirely because of the Sanders movement. Now, I think one of the big questions for many Sanders supporters is, are her words and what's written in paper going to actually come to pass when she is elected president? That's, I think, the greatest worry for many Sanders supporters. And frankly, that's the sale she has to make. That's not something Bernie Sanders can deliver. She has to make that sale. SIMON: It sounds like you do not altogether trust Hillary Clinton. TASINI: You can hope and wish and pray that those things are legitimate conversions and that she now is a different candidate, a person with a different philosophy. That's something that, you know, sometimes, yes, it's hard to believe. But again, I want to say that even - and Bernie said this many, many times - in several of the actual public debates, she said on her worst day, Hillary Clinton's a thousand times better than Donald Trump. And Donald Trump, in my view, is a threat to the nation. SIMON: What's your reaction to the leaked emails from the Democratic National Committee? TASINI: You know, for me, it was a little bit of a kerfuffle, something that really only confirmed what we knew months ago. We were telling, and frankly the media didn't take it seriously, during the time when we tried to point out that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was biased. She scheduled debates at times that didn't draw huge audiences, I believe, and many believe, because she didn't want Bernie to have a larger exposure to the voters. I joke that if she could find a 3 a.m. slot in the Home Shopping Network, she would grab that. So those emails only confirm what we knew. SIMON: Is the Bernie Sanders campaign, as it exists today, organized or, all Whole Foods jokes aside, organic? TASINI: (Laughter) That is a good joke, Scott. Look, I approach this convention with this view, that the convention is kind of hoopla but a very small part of this long road in a movement. And there's no question that this is a movement. I could tell you, as I traveled around the country, I met hundreds if not thousands of people who want to change the country. And you've got, now, 1,900 Bernie delegates who are now going back to their communities in 50 states. I know people want to run for public office, for mayor, for city council. These are people who now want to change the country. Now, getting from here to there, it's a lot of hard work. And I think that the political revolution has just started. SIMON: Are you Democrats though or something else? TASINI: Well, I would say that the people, largely, who I met were Democrats. But really it's what - people want to change the country. They think that the Democratic Party is the vehicle. But let's face it, if the Democratic Party does not respond and Hillary Clinton does then not go forth and implement the things she supports now if she's elected president, the Democratic Party will lose a lot of people. And I do think that we may be looking at a period in the next few years where the two-party system will fracture. SIMON: Jonathan Tasini was a Bernie Sanders surrogate and author of ""The Essential Bernie Sanders And His Vision For America."" Thanks so much for joining us. TASINI: Pleasure to be here.

npr,"July 30, 2016",Do Putin And Trump Really Have Something To Gain From One Another?," JULIA IOFFE: Thanks for having me, Scott. SIMON: Do Russia and Vladimir Putin have a special hostility toward Hillary Clinton? IOFFE: They do, indeed. So Hillary Clinton, back in December 2011, after a very fraudulent parliamentary election, came out and said that it was, in fact, a fraudulent election and that Russians deserve to have their voices heard. And Putin, allegedly, was furious. He actually came out and said that Hillary Clinton had given the signal to the protesters. Kremlin-owned TV was saying that the protesters were being paid by the State Department, that they were all stooges for Hillary Clinton. And these were anti-Putin protests, so he kind of sees her as having meddled in his internal politics. So to some extent, he's just giving as good as he thinks he got. SIMON: And what do you think of this whole idea that there's some kind of mutual admiration society between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin? IOFFE: I think it's quite plausible. They're both very cynical men, very opportunistic men. You know, they seem to get each other. Although I think Donald Trump kind of underestimates Putin and doesn't quite realize that he's going to get eaten for lunch. SIMON: Yeah. And does WikiLeaks have some kind of relationship going with the Russian government? IOFFE: They do, indeed. So Julian Assange was portrayed as a hero in Russian media and was given a show on Russia Today, which is the Kremlin's English-language propaganda network. And Edward Snowden actually didn't end up in Russia by accident. When he left Hong Kong, he left with the editor of WikiLeaks, Sarah Harrison, and she accompanied him from Hong Kong all the way to Moscow and was with him the whole month that he was stuck in that airport. It's reported that WikiLeaks helped negotiate and arrange Edward Snowden's asylum in Russia. SIMON: At the same time, is it possible this is all circumstantial evidence? I mean, for example, when Donald Trump says he might accept Russia's annexation of Crimea and lift sanctions, that's the kind of thing almost any U.S. president might decide to do in the next few years anyway, isn't it? IOFFE: Oh, absolutely. I don't think that Trump is in any way a plant for Putin or that he's doing anything in collusion. I think that he's kind of playing into this image as an iconoclast. But he's also had this admiration for Putin that is almost fan girl-like When he took the Miss Universe pageant to Moscow in 2013, he kept tweeting that he really hoped to meet Vladimir Putin, that he wanted to be best friends with him. Then he lied and said that he met him in the green room when, in fact, he hadn't. So he's trying to cozy up to him, and I think Vladimir Putin would gladly have this. But I think it's just kind of falling into his lap. SIMON: You - you've been in Russia recently, right, Julia? IOFFE: Yeah, yeah, I was just there in June. SIMON: What's campaign coverage like there? IOFFE: Even before the hack, if you watched, the way they covered our presidential campaign, it was very clear very early on who they wanted to win. After it became clear that Jeb Bush was no longer the favorite, they kind of went all in for Trump. Coverage is all about how evil Hillary Clinton is, how she's a warmonger, she's - she laughed and clapped her hands when she heard that Muammar Gaddafi died, which was a very sore point for Putin who takes these things very personally when dictators are toppled and killed. When they talk about Donald Trump, on the other hand, they talk about him as a pragmatist, as a man who understands that America is overextended in the world and that it needs to pull back in order not to destroy itself, which, of course, would be very convenient for Russia because when the U.S. pulls out, Russia steps right in to the resulting vacuum. And I think, for them, Donald Trump would be ideal because he advocates a kind of pulling back of American power, which would create more room for Russian power.

npr,"July 29, 2016",Is Hillary Clinton The First Woman Nominee — Or The First Female Nominee?," (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: First female nominee. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: First woman nominee. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: The first female nominee. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DAVID MUIR: The first woman to be a nominee for a major party. MCEVERS: Deborah Tannen is a linguistics professor at Georgetown University, and she has been in conversation with other linguists about this. Welcome to the show. DEBORAH TANNEN: It's my pleasure to be here. MCEVERS: Let's just start out with, like, a pure grammar rule here. I mean, female is an adjective. Woman is a noun. Does that sort of give us definitive guidance on which one we should use here? TANNEN: I would say woman used to be a noun, and now it is a noun and also an adjective. And words change their functions in that way. It's one of the most common phenomena about words. They start as one thing, and they end up as something else. I think it's really important, too, to keep in mind many of us - and often it's the people who love language - will point to a dictionary definition or a grammar rule and say, well, this is how it should be. The meanings of words and the uses of words come from practice from the way people in a given culture use those words. MCEVERS: So you say first woman presidential nominee of a major political party and not first female? TANNEN: Yes. I would say first woman. MCEVERS: You know, there was a time when we called ourselves ladies. When did that stop and how is that not an option now? TANNEN: I believe the switch from lady to woman was part of the women's movement. Lady was a euphemism for woman and that was one reason that we wanted to move away from it. We didn't like the idea that the very notion of woman somehow was unseemly, and also a lady was someone who spoke and acted in ways that was self-effacing and never strong. MCEVERS: So as we think about the idea that at some point the women's movement decided we're going to stop using the word lady and we're going to start using the word woman, and now with this sometimes emphasis on the word female, I think a lot of people in feminist circles would say that puts too much emphasis on the biological. TANNEN: In my own writing, I avoid female and try to say woman because I feel that the word female has connotations of not just biology, but also non-human mammals. The idea of female to me is more appropriate for a female animal. MCEVERS: You know, I think about words that we don't really say anymore. You don't hear people say stewardess. People say flight attendant. There's a whole conversation about actress versus actor. But in the case of the first female or woman presidential nominee for a major party, the modifier is important, right? TANNEN: It is important. I don't think the distinction between female and woman is as significant as taking the E-S-S endings off words like actress, stewardess. Those endings created a sense of trivial unimportant, easily dismissed. Would you entrust your life to a doctoress? I don't think the distinction between female and woman has quite that impact. It's not like moving on from the words girl and the words lady where girl trivialized, lady trivialized. Both of them made the woman being talked about less important, less serious, less worthy of respect. MCEVERS: So female or woman, either one probably fine? TANNEN: I think some people are going to prefer female. Some will prefer woman. One will probably rise to the top, and the other will probably go the way of girl and lady. I do prefer woman, but I don't feel that the distinction is as significant as some of the other words that we've left behind. MCEVERS: That's Deborah Tannen. She is a linguistics professor at Georgetown University. Thank you very much for joining us. TANNEN: My pleasure. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"July 29, 2016","No Rest For The Weary: Hours After Convention's End, Clinton Hits The Trail"," Welcome to the general election. After last night's balloon drop at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, the final push to November is underway. Donald Trump is in Colorado today. We'll hear from him elsewhere in the show. We'll start now with NPR's Tamara Keith, who's traveling with Hillary Clinton. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: The big, blue buses wrapped with the campaign slogan, stronger together, were parked outside and ready to hit the road when Hillary Clinton and her running mate, Tim Kaine, bounded onto stage at Temple University in Philadelphia. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN: So I will introduce them as the Clinton Family and the Kaine family. KEITH: Kaine spoke first. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TIM KAINE: I was tired after last night, but I'm awake now. (APPLAUSE) KEITH: The American flags waved by every supporter in the crowd seemed to have migrated from the convention hall the night before. There are always plenty of flags at political events, no matter the party, but this was a lot of flags. The message - unmistakable. In this election, Clinton argues, it isn't about simple partisan differences. It's about core American values. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HILLARY CLINTON: I can't think of an election that is more important, certainly in my lifetime. And it's not so much that I'm on the ticket; it is because of the stark choice that is posed to America in this election. KEITH: That choice was highlighted at the Democratic convention with speeches from pro-Clinton Republicans, a general and the father of a fallen Muslim-American soldier. The pitch is that this isn't a race between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, but between America and Donald Trump. Debbie Cantor came to see Clinton and Kaine at Temple. She watched the convention on TV, but says she turned down several watch-party invites. DEBBIE CANTOR: I said, I can't go to a party because I'm crying. And it's just - you know, for a woman - I'm now 60. And to see that there's such a beautiful change possible - it's possible. KEITH: And as Cantor sees it, Clinton is the right person for this moment. CANTOR: I think she needed these years of hard - hardship to show what her true character is. And although she's a little bit hard on the outside, she's exactly what we need. KEITH: Clinton and Kaine will spend the next three days campaigning in Pennsylvania and Ohio. They'll be stopping in towns like Hatfield and Youngstown to highlight efforts to recover from economic hardship and a decline in traditional manufacturing. These are swing states President Obama won in 2012, but where Donald Trump is making a strong appeal to working-class, white voters. He talks regularly about the loss of manufacturing jobs and promises to reopen steel plants. With this bus tour, Clinton and Kaine are offering their answer. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CLINTON: Within the first 100 days of our administration, we're going to break through the gridlock in Washington and make the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II. (APPLAUSE) KEITH: And drawing a contrast with Trump. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CLINTON: I find it highly amusing that Donald Trump talks about make America great again. He doesn't make a thing in America except bankruptcies. (APPLAUSE) KEITH: And with that, Clinton and Kaine boarded a bus with their spouses and set off to visit a Pennsylvania factory.

npr,"July 29, 2016",Trump Says Democrats Aren't Focusing On Terrorism," And I'm David Greene in Philadelphia. They are picking up all of those balloons at the Wells Fargo Center a few miles from where we are here near the Liberty Bell. My colleague, Don Gonyea, is in the studio with me. And, Don, I guess it's, from here on, it's game-on time for this election. DON GONYEA, BYLINE: Absolutely. And last week, Republicans got a small bump, a medium-sized bump in the polls from their convention. We'll see if that happens for the Democrats. But we do see now that they have set a template, the Clinton campaign, for how to go forward - try to take the high ground but also tear into Donald Trump. GREENE: All right. Well, Trump, speaking of him, had a little advice for his supporters. Our colleague Sarah McCammon is traveling with him. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: As Donald Trump took the stage in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, last night, he reminded the crowd of supporters that Democrats were also gathering in another city... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: Thank you... UNIDENTIFIED TRUMP SUPPORTERS: (Chanting) USA, USA, USA... TRUMP: Thank you. You know, they have a little thing going on right now in Philadelphia. But I want to be right here. Look at what we have, look... MCCAMMON: Trump's campaign had sent out an email earlier in the day telling supporters not to watch Clinton's acceptance speech unless, as they put it, they wanted to be lied to. But Trump suggested he would watch. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: I'll go home, I guess, and watch. I guess. Are we going to watch tonight? UNIDENTIFIED TRUMP SUPPORTERS: (Booing). TRUMP: I don't know. I don't know. UNIDENTIFIED TRUMP SUPPORTERS: (Chanting) Lock her up. Lock her up... TRUMP: (Laughter). UNIDENTIFIED TRUMP SUPPORTERS: ...Lock her up... MCCAMMON: Lock her up, the crowd was shouting. It's become a frequent chant at Trump rallies directed toward Clinton. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: So let's do this, let's do this. On Nov. 8, let's just win. That's the best, Nov. 8. MCCAMMON: Trump accused Clinton and President Obama of painting an overly-rosy picture of the state of the country. He said they should instead be focusing on terrorism, crime and problems in the economy. Citing recent deadly attacks in Europe and the United States, he promised to stop groups like ISIS. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: They have to be stopped very, very strongly and very viciously if we have to, if we have to. MCCAMMON: Trump said ISIS is playing by different rules and suggested the U.S. should be, too. Again, criticizing President Obama's rejection of torture, Trump said, bring on the waterboarding. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: So they asked me about it. I say, no problem, no problem. You have to do it. MCCAMMON: As Democrats wrapped up their convention, Trump also took a swipe at Clinton's former rival, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who has spent much of the week urging his supporters to back the Democratic nominee. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: He made a deal with the devil. He got nothing from making the deal. MCCAMMON: Trump has spent much of the last few days mocking Sanders for endorsing Clinton, while also asking disaffected Sanders voters to back him in November. With the general election in mind, the Republican nominee is rounding out the week with two stops in another swing state, Colorado. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"July 29, 2016",New Reports Of Hackers In Democratic Party Computer Systems," Updated 7:25 p.m. with comment from Clinton campaign on DNC hack The Hillary Clinton campaign says an analytics program it uses was hacked as part of the previously reported intrusion into the Democratic National Committee computer system. The campaign says it doesn't believe its own systems were accessed. The FBI has issued a statement saying it is looking into the reports. Our original post continues: Another branch of the Democratic Party says it has been hacked. This time it's the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. The committee raises money and helps the party's candidates for the U.S. House. In a statement, DCCC press secretary Meredith Kelly confirmed it was the ""target of a cyber security incident,"" which investigators say is similar to other recent incidents, including breaches of the Democratic National Committee's computer network. Russia is widely believed to have been behind that incident, which is being investigated by the FBI. The DCCC says it is cooperating with federal law enforcement as part of an ongoing investigation. It has also hired the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike to assist in addressing the hack. CrowdStrike would not comment other than to confirm it was engaged by the DCCC. In June, the same company said it detected two separate breaches on the DNC's network. One, it said, was the work of ""Cozy Bear,"" likely the Russian intelligence agency known as the FSB, the successor to the Soviet-era KGB. The other breach, CrowdStrike identified as ""Fancy Bear,"" which the company says was the work of Russian military intelligence. The cyberattacks have become a campaign issue. The DNC hackers retrieved internal DNC emails and posted them last week on the website of WikiLeaks. Those emails showed party officials expressing a preference for Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders as the Democratic presidential nominee, even though the DNC is supposed to remain neutral during primary elections. That leak led to the resignation of DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Shultz this week. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump then stirred up more controversy when he cited the DNC hack and called on Russia to find emails deleted from Hillary Clinton's private email server when she was secretary of state, a comment he later said was sarcastic. Earlier this year, Director of National Security James Clapper warned that political campaigns would be likely targets of hacking attempts, a prediction that appears to be coming true.

npr,"July 29, 2016",Campaign For Universal Health Care In Colorado Seeks Bernie Sanders' Help," ""I believe that health care is a right, not a privilege,"" Sen. Bernie Sanders told Denver supporters in February. ColoradoCare supporters hope to leverage his charisma for a win on their state amendment. Backers of ColoradoCare — the state ballot initiative that would establish universal health care in Colorado — think they have the perfect job for former presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders. With the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia behind him, Sanders ""comes to Colorado and campaigns for single-payer — and we win,"" says T.R. Reid, one of the architects of ColoradoCare. The initiative aims to provide every resident of Colorado with affordable health insurance. Sanders made universal coverage one of the cornerstones of his presidential bid. The proposal comes with a $38 billion annual price tag — to be paid by a tax on workers and businesses. The program would eliminate the need for insurance premiums and deductibles, and proponents claim it would save the state and individuals a lot of money. Reid says the backers of ColoradoCare have pitched Sanders' team, hoping he will campaign on behalf of the measure that will come before voters in November. Sanders has already championed the issue in the state — he pushed for a single-payer system during his Democratic primary campaign in Colorado. It was one of his key health care positions, and it got thousands of his supporters cheering at an event in Denver in February. ""I believe that health care is a right, not privilege,"" Sanders told cheering crowds. He also beat that drum during a TV appearance with MSNBC's Rachel Maddow in May. Sanders pointed out that Canada started what would eventually become its nationwide system of universal health care by persuading lawmakers in each province — one province at a time. ""So if you're asking me, do I think if a major state — whether it's Colorado or California or whatever — goes forward and it works well, [will] other states say 'Hey, you know, I got a brother over there in Colorado and he's getting health care, great health care and it's less expensive than the current system,' "" Sanders said. ""Yeah, I think that is one possibility."" The whole concept of ColoradoCare — or Amendment 69, as it will appear on the ballot — appeals to Andrew Kleiman, a 35-year-old Sanders supporter from Grand Junction. ""I think we're just at such a tipping point,"" Kleiman says. ""The momentum of Bernie's campaign carried over into something like this would be a perfect fit and pretty necessary."" Kleiman says if Sanders actively backed the proposal in Colorado it would help motivate millennials like him to vote. Reid agrees. ""The last poll showed 60 percent of millennials support ColoradoCare,"" he says. ""Those are Bernie people and if he can turn them out to vote, we win."" But a coalition of opponents, including conservatives, insurance firms and business groups, has come out against the initiative, which is expected to draw big money from both sides. ""I don't think the economics of it work out,"" says Nina Anderson, a small business owner in Grand Junction. She says the proposed program would be too expensive for small businesses and employees. Colorado has been on the cutting edge of some other big policy changes, like legalizing recreational pot. Anderson says she's not ready for the state to take the lead on a huge government-run health care system, and does not think Sanders should jump in. ""That is the scary part, I think, about being in Colorado and being on the forefront of anything that is attempting to move to socialized care,"" Anderson says. ""You do get everybody with outside interests coming in and playing in your sandbox."" Cody Belzley, who served as senior health policy analyst to former Democratic Gov. Bill Ritter, opposes the proposal and says she's not sure what difference Sanders would make — if he did come. ""It's such a strange political year,"" Belzley says. ""I think it's really hard to know what's going to impact Colorado voters or the outcome of Amendment 69. I think this is a decision to be made by Colorado voters, based on what's going to be best for them and their families."" Colorado voters haven't passed a general tax increase in years. Obamacare cut the state's uninsured rate in half, but many residents still struggle with high premiums and deductibles. Belzley, who works for a group opposing the amendment, Coloradans for Coloradans, urges voters to look at the details. ""I think when folks look at that,"" she says, ""they come to understand this is just too risky a proposal."" Sanders' presence in Colorado could motivate voters on both sides, says Seth Masket, a political science professor at the University of Denver. ""That's kind of the mixed message of initiatives,"" Masket says. ""They can really draw out both sides, depending on how passionate people are on the subject. The key for supporters of this initiative would be to translate passion for Sanders into passion for this initiative. Sanders is probably the best equipped to actually make that case."" A representative from the Sanders campaign, Michael Briggs, says the topic is something that ""interests Bernie very much. We don't have a trip scheduled yet, but he has been keeping a close eye on this."" This story is part of NPR's reporting partnership with Colorado Public Radio and Kaiser Health News.

npr,"July 29, 2016",The Economy And Politics Of 1968: Now Playing In Reruns," In so many ways, 1968 was a great year for middle-class Americans' wallets — and terrible for politics. On the one hand, gasoline was cheap and unemployment was low. Real estate values were rising, helping average homeowners build wealth. Good times! Still, many people were not feeling good — at all. In 1968, the tumultuous presidential-election year brought strident clashes at political events, third-party disruptions, calls for ""law and order,"" racial discord and worries about foreign enemies. Sound familiar? In terms of both the economy and politics, we seem to have a summer rerun playing out. Here are some of the parallels on the economic front: Of course, not everything is the same. These are two big differences: There's another difference: On Friday, the Commerce Department said gross domestic product, the broadest measure of goods and services produced in this country. rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.2 percent in the second quarter. In 1968, GDP growth was running at 4.9 percent. So on the surface, growth appears far less robust than in the late 1960s. But the current sluggishness is related to weak business investment. On the consumer side, personal consumption expanded at a 4.2 percent rate, much more in line with 1968. And there's plenty of evidence of that at retail outlets. The National Retail Federation predicts back-to-school spending will hit $75.8 billion — up more than 11 percent from last year's $68 billion. ""We are optimistic that overall economic growth and consumer spending will continue to improve,"" NRF President Matthew Shay said in a statement. So when you examine data over many decades, both 1968 and 2016 look like good years for average Americans. They sure beat the Depression of the 1930s, or the inflation nightmare of the 1970s or the frightful foreclosure years of the Great Recession. No year is perfect, but there's no doubt you'd be happier working in the summer of 1968 or 2016, compared with 1974 or 2009. So why such intense political discord, both then and now? These parallels may offer clues: Maybe this year's political discontent can best be explained by a theory known as the ""revolution of rising expectations."" The phrase was popularized in the 1950s to describe global upheavals in the wake of postwar decolonization. The idea was that rising economic expectations can made people restless and more open to insurgencies and revolution than during tough times when people are just trying to survive. In other words, just as the summer of 1968's political tumult came in the midst of good economic times, this year's intense political debates are playing out in an economic environment that's better for average families than at any time in many years.

npr,"July 29, 2016","For Sanders Supporters, Clinton's Historic Nomination Brings Mixed Emotions"," On Tuesday as Hillary Clinton's was officially nominated as the first major party female presidential nominee, women (and yes, some men) all over the Wells Fargo Arena in Philadelphia danced, cried, embraced and howled with joy. The Democratic National Convention erupted into a deafening celebration over a woman being thisclose to the presidency, 240 years after the U.S. was founded and nearly 100 years after women got the right to vote. And it was a show of unity that put her over the top, as her once-bitter rival Bernie Sanders called for her nomination by acclamation. But it wasn't all women who were rejoicing. Despite the Vermont senator's unequivocal endorsement of Clinton this week, many in the minority of his supporters continued pushing their candidate in spite of Clinton's win. During her acceptance speech Thursday night, scattered Sanders supporters clad in bright yellow, glow-in-the-dark shirts periodically chanted in protest and waved signs. For some of the delegates still supporting Sanders, the historic moment inspired not ecstasy but conflicting feelings. LaDawn Jones, a 36-year-old Georgia state representative, said it's exciting to elect a woman, but when it comes to Clinton being that women, she's ambivalent. ""It's historic, I have a daughter, I want her to be able to experience that. But for some reason, this election, that was not enough to make me a Hillary supporter,"" she said. Jones learned about Sanders last fall, when she read his autobiography. She said she identifies with him because she sees both Sanders and herself as political ""outsiders."" And now that he has lost the nomination battle, she doesn't have as much enthusiasm for voting this fall. ""One hundred percent I will be voting for [Clinton] in November,"" Jones said. ""It's going to take me until November 7 at 11:59 to really get excited about it, but I'm going to vote for her."" Clinton is very clearly making a gender-based appeal in this presidential election, leaning into her historic candidacy in a way she didn't in her failed bid eight years ago. This week's convention featured speeches from women House members and senators, Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards, a bevy of female celebrities, and the ""Mothers of the Movement."" Her Tuesday live video appearance even referenced ""breaking the glass ceiling,"" as her ""entrance"" featured her shattering a panel depicting the previous 44 presidents. Clinton will surely carry the women's vote this fall — women have voted more Democratic in every presidential election since 1980, but this year could feature the widest gender gap in modern electoral history. That isn't necessarily because women are flocking to Hillary because of her gender; rather, many people (men and women alike) are voting for Clinton largely as a vote against polarizing GOP nominee Donald Trump. Similarly, she struggles to win over male voters from Trump. While many Sanders supporters are unenthusiastic about Clinton, she is still set to win most of their votes. According to a new report from the Pew Research Center, 90 percent of people who consistently supported Sanders said they favored her over Trump in the election. For those Sanders supporters Clinton hasn't won over, there is another female presidential candidate. Green Party nominee Jill Stein has actively pursued the Sanders supporters and shares their liberal views. And that's who Ryan Trundle, a shop foreman from Shreveport, La., will be voting for. ""Any woman would be awesome and amazing,"" he said, mentioning Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and former Ohio state senator Nina Turner, a prominent Sanders supporter, as examples. ""This one, I would never vote for her,"" he said of Clinton. Many other Sanders supporters think similarly — they champion women in government, but they say they can't support this woman. ""I support women at all levels of office, but I'm most interested in voting for women who represent my views and policies, which is why I supported Bernie Sanders,"" said Jessa Lewis, a delegate from Washington state. Many delegates — Sanders and Clinton supporters alike — referred to their mothers or daughters or other women in their lives when talking about Clinton. And that means some Sanders supporters are experiencing the excitement, if only secondhand. They invoked the older generation of feminists when talking about Clinton's nomination. ""In my lifetime, I don't really remember a time when I didn't know I could be an astronaut. And even though there hadn't been a female president, I knew there could be. It wasn't a question of if, but when,"" said Sara Laird, a 37-year-old delegate from Gettysburg, Pa. ""But I realize it's a very different thing for my mom's generation,"" she continued, ""and I celebrate the accomplishment and their fight that they've done for me and my daughters."" Laird declined to say how she would be voting in November. Washington state Sanders delegate Darin Brunstad also demurred, saying he would focus on down-ballot races. And though Sanders had lost, Brunstad said he appreciated how his mom must be feeling this week. ""I will say that my mother, who was very active in the early feminist movement, was a huge Hillary supporter,"" he said. ""And I know how proud she is at this moment, and I am very happy for her.""

The ticket, their spouses and this is - this is the beginning of the sprint. GREENE: Right up the road from here. GONYEA: Right up the road at Temple, yeah. GREENE: Well, I want to play some tape. We've been listening to people attending the convention all week. And a young woman named Safiya Ghori, she is - was spending a lot of time with delegates from Arkansas. She's the page for the Arkansas delegation. She's a practicing Muslim, and she has two children. SAFIYA GHORI-AHMAD: The minute the news hits that there's a terrorist attack, every Muslim I know thinks to themselves, please, God, let it not be a Muslim. Let it not be the name of my son or my daughter. GREENE: Do you think - you're thinking that? GHORI-AHMAD: Yes, all of us are. All of us are thinking that. I mean, we all kind of collectively hold our breath and hope that it's not an American Muslim because it's so tough for this counter-narrative to come out of American Muslims who are peaceful and you're citizens and taxpaying and law-abiding people. But I think it's on us to kind of get that narrative out there, and we do try to do that. GREENE: If, God forbid, there are more attacks, if those attacks are tied to Muslims, do you think that makes it more likely that Donald Trump becomes president? GHORI-AHMAD: I think it does feed into his narrative that Muslims are dangerous, and, you know, your Muslim neighbors can't be trusted, and they should be banned. And immigration is the issue, so let's put up borders. And I think Donald Trump will play into that. GREENE: Safiya Ghori, attending the convention from the state of Arkansas there. I want to bring in another voice. It's Congressman David Schweikert. He's a Republican from Arizona and a frequent guest on our program. Congressman, good morning to you. DAVID SCHWEIKERT: Good morning, David. GREENE: I just want to ask you about what that young woman told me. I mean, she is very fearful of more attacks on this country, fearful that Muslims will be blamed and feels that if that happens Donald Trump will be president. Does that frame the campaign in a way that the more people in this country are afraid of outside threats that that is where Donald Trump could get sort of communicate a message that resonates? SCHWEIKERT: What I think it frames is - if this makes sense - a randomness. What happens if 10 days out from the actual Election Day there's some type of horrible attack? Does that end up at that punctuated moment sort of defining the narrative? You know, it - being out here in Arizona, I am blessed to represent a gentleman named Zuhdi Jasser who was on television repeatedly trying to explain the difference between Islam and political Islam. But that's a much more difficult story to tell than sort of the visceral nature of a horrible act. GREENE: Do you think Donald Trump does that well, making that distinction? Because I think a lot of voters might not feel that he makes that distinction, that he plays on fears in a way that doesn't recognize that distinction. SCHWEIKERT: Look, the distinction's going to - is complicated because there's many levels of, you know, Sunni, Shia, those of us who actually bathe in the news and bathe in the policy. And I think much of the American public wants to live their lives and know that someone is focused on it. And, you know, it was - listening to the secretary's speech last night, sort of kept waiting for that intense empathy to sort of Middle America's angst. And I'm not sure it was well-woven into that speech. GREENE: Congressman, I - you know, one thing Hillary Clinton did say, though, is that Donald Trump took your party from morning in America to midnight in America. I mean, it was a convention in Cleveland that seemed in contrast to Philadelphia, you know, talking about how frightened many Americans are. I mean, is - did you like the - what seemed like a very dark feel at your party's convention? And is that a fair assessment from Secretary Clinton? SCHWEIKERT: Look, you're talking to someone who's probably pathologically optimistic, so I mean (laughter)... GREENE: I like that line. SCHWEIKERT: ...I may not be the best person to sort of - look, I am blessed to live in Arizona, which is sort of - you move out to the, you know, the West as an optimistic personality. But did the convention reflect a change in the Republican Party or did the convention reflect where sort of the fears, the hearts, the thoughts of much of America is today? GREENE: Did it reflect your optimism? SCHWEIKERT: I don't think it affected or reflected my - personal optimism. But I do think it reflected sort of an angst, a discomfort, particularly for such a huge swath of America which doesn't sort of see the income mobility or, you know, discussions of, you know, whether it be debt and deficits and all the things that are scary and complicated. GREENE: Are you proud of your party's message right now? SCHWEIKERT: I actually wish my party would do a much more detailed drill down on solutions. And that's actually - think about the - sort of this contrast last night. Secretary Clinton was doing a very workman-like speech, step by step. And then, when she sort of got into a rhythm, the rhythm sounded like a plethora of sort of very left proposals that I might have heard back in the '90s. GREENE: Although specifics that many say that people did not hear from your party's candidate, Donald Trump. SCHWEIKERT: Yeah. From my party, I think we actually have to get much more detailed, that there are ways - there really are solutions to every complex problem. But a lot of them require market-based solutions and technology-based solutions. And for many of us out there, you know, who serve in Congress, we're waiting for any leadership out there to understand. There are solutions, but that supercomputer you carry around in your pocket, or that smartphone, believe it or not, is one of the platforms we can build solutions for our community. GREENE: All right. Republican Congressman David Schweikert, thanks for joining us as always. SCHWEIKERT: Enjoyed it, David. GREENE: Thank you. Janet Hook, Don Gonyea, what do you make of that? GONYEA: It's - we're talking about how Muslim Americans react. It's actually broader than that because you hear a lot of the same things when you talk to Hispanic-Latino Americans. And Trump has been a powerful motivator for a lot of them in Congressman Schweikert's whole state - home state, one place to get motivated, to get registered, all that. GREENE: Janet, just about 10-15 seconds. JANET HOOK: Yeah. I think that obviously the congressman is a little bit uncomfortable with the message coming out of his convention. What I don't know is whether members of Congress like him are going to be able to separate themselves enough from the message that Trump is setting. GREENE: OK. Janet Hook from The Wall Street Journal and NPR national political correspondent Don Gonyea, thank you both. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"July 29, 2016",Clinton Says Democrats Need To Create Opportunity For 'Working People'," (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) HILLARY CLINTON: Donald Trump says, and this is a quote, ""I know more about ISIS than the generals do."" No, Donald. You don't. (APPLAUSE) GREENE: And Hillary Clinton also had this line. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) CLINTON: So just ask yourself - do you really think Donald Trump has the temperament to be commander in chief? UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Booing). CLINTON: Donald Trump can't even handle the rough and tumble of a presidential campaign. (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: He loses his cool at the slightest provocation - when he's gotten a tough question from a reporter, when he's challenged in a debate, when he sees a protester at a rally. Imagine, if you dare, imagine, imagine him in the oval office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. GREENE: And I am in the studio here in Philadelphia with Janet Hook who covers politics for The Wall Street Journal and our own Don Gonyea, NPR's national political correspondent. Good morning to you both. DON GONYEA, BYLINE: Good morning. JANET HOOK: Good morning. GREENE: So that got a wonderful reception inside a hall full of Democrats. The two of you have spent a lot of time with voters around this country. I mean, do people in this country trust Hillary Clinton to be commander in chief? GONYEA: The numbers certainly show that she has high unfavorability ratings - 55 percent, if you look at the latest Real Clear Politics polling averages. Fifty-five percent of the people have a negative opinion of her. That is sky-high. That would be a record, except Donald Trump clicks in at 57 percent (laughter) so... GREENE: This is overall likability, it's... GONYEA: Overall likability. This is negative view of her. So in this speech last night, and in her campaign going forward, she wants, she needs - needs - people to kind of rethink who she is, rethink what they think of her. And as we hear in that cut, they want people to think for the first time who Donald Trump really is. GREENE: And, Janet, did Hillary Clinton do anything to sort of give people a reason to think of her differently and think of her more favorably, especially when it comes to something like being president and having the nuclear codes, as she would say? HOOK: Well, the focus on foreign policy is really what she wants to get away from the general likability question because it really distills two key messages she has which is that. I'm prepared, he's not. He's scary, I'm not. And on foreign policy, it really kind of gets to this - you know, it's interesting because foreign policy isn't often top-of-mind for voters. In this election, it's a little bit more focused on national security because of the terrorist threat and so forth. But - and for Hillary Clinton, it plays to her strength that she actually does have this resume. How much do people care about resume? I don't know. But for her, it's key that she focus on, I'm prepared for the job whether you like me or not. GREENE: One reason that she did focus on that so much last night. Let's turn to something else she focused on here. In that speech, Hillary Clinton seemed to bring up what's one of her biggest weaknesses this election year. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) CLINTON: Democrats, we are the party of working people. (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: But we haven't done a good enough job showing we get what you're going through. And we're going to do something to help. So tonight, I want to tell you how we will empower Americans to live better lives. My primary mission as president will be to create more opportunity and more good jobs with rising wages right here in the United States... (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: ...From my first day in office to my last, especially in places that for too long have been left out and left behind, from our inner cities to our small towns, from Indian country to coal country... (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: ...From communities ravaged by addiction, to regions hollowed out by plant closures. And here's what I believe. I believe America thrives when the middle class thrives. I believe our economy isn't working the way it should because our democracy isn't working the way it should. (APPLAUSE) GREENE: You're listening to Hillary Clinton from last night. And I want to bring in another person who's sitting here at the table with us. It's Jim Davis. He's the Democratic Party chair in Fayette County, Pa. Jim, good morning. JIM DAVIS: Good morning. GREENE: You and I've gotten to know each other. You are from a county south of Pittsburgh, a once-thriving coal area. You described to me when I first met you a couple months ago that there is a landscape of little towns in your county that are in different levels of decay now with coal and steel no longer thriving. I feel like Hillary Clinton might have been trying to reach out directly to your community. DAVIS: I hope so. I think she was, to a point. I don't think she could, in that address, articulate all the issues there and her solutions to the problems that we face. But I do think she was attempting to reach out to the people there. GREENE: You and I spoke just before the Pennsylvania primary. And you, as Democratic Party chair, were seeing a lot of - a good number of Democratic voters change their registration to be able to vote for Donald Trump. You - I mean, you've sounded very worried as someone involved in this party that many people, many Democrats in your county could vote for Trump. Anything this week, anything last night that you think may have persuaded some of the working people in Fayette County to move towards Hillary Clinton at all? DAVIS: Well, first and foremost, I hope that some of them were listening. I hope that some of the people that were leaning toward Donald Trump are Democrats that are in our area were listening because if they were, I think there was quite a few things that were said by not only Secretary Clinton but other speakers that do talk about and speak to the problems of our area and the solutions that may be available. GREENE: Can you just remind us what Donald Trump's appeal is in a place like Fayette County? DAVIS: I think it's a false bravado. He tells people what they want to hear. I'm going to bring back coal. I'm going to bring back steel. I'm there for you. I'm a tough guy. And I just think it's a false bravado. And I also think it's the fear mongering. And people - when you come into these economic hard times, if you will, that we've had for so long, you know, fear is a big factor. They're afraid. They're afraid they can't pay their mortgage. They're afraid that they can't pay their student debts. They're just - they're fearful. GREENE: Let me play one more bit of Hillary Clinton last night. This was taking on what I think she knows is another weakness in her campaign. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) CLINTON: The truth is, through all these years of public service, the service part has always come easier to me than the public part. I get it that some people just don't know what to make of me. So let me tell you. The family I'm from, well, no one had their name on big buildings. My family were builders of a different kind, builders in the way most American families are. They used whatever tools they had, whatever God gave them and whatever life that America provided and built better lives and better futures for their kids. GREENE: Jim Davis, let me just ask you this. She's saying there that the service part of her career, you know, has always come easier than the public part. In terms of winning over some of the voters in your county, is it about specific solutions and policies which she says is her strength? How much of it, though, is about sort of that connection that she can make versus Donald Trump? DAVIS: Well, you have to make the connection or they don't get the message. And that is - that's critical. I think she took steps and has been taking steps to make the connection. I don't know that she's gotten there yet. And I know that we in Fayette County, the Democrats, are going to do everything we can to help her make that connection. But - and she's got to continue to articulate. She's got to talk about increasing the minimum wage. She's got to talk about doing something to protect the coal miners when these large companies go bankrupt and discharge their pension liability. She's got to talk about what we're going to do to the coal miner that's laid off and has been laid off. Can we find methods of clean coal energy? Can we do something to develop the infrastructure of the oil and gas industry, which is really - was doing so well and all of a sudden now it's just kind of fallen off. What can she do? What can the federal government do? And there are things that can be done. And she's got to articulate those. GREENE: And let me just ask you briefly, Janet Hook and Don Gonyea, I mean, how big a problem is it, potentially, for Hillary Clinton if she cannot win over a count of voters in counties like Jim's? GONYEA: She doesn't need to win them. She just needs to not lose as badly as she is right now. She's winning in other demographic, you know, categories. But she can't just get swamped with those voters. HOOK: Well - and the main thing is, she's got to win Pennsylvania. Whatever coalition she needs to put together, Pennsylvania's one of those key states. Pennsylvania, Ohio - that's why, out of the convention, she's going on a bus tour straight into those states. GREENE: OK. Sitting here with Jim Davis, who's the Democratic Party chair in Fayette County, Pa., south of Pittsburgh. Janet Hook covers national politics for The Wall Street Journal. Don Gonyea covers national politics for us at NPR. Listening to some of the highlights from Hillary Clinton's speech last night, and what they mean. Thank you all very much. GONYEA: Thank you.

npr,"July 29, 2016",Philadelphia Boosts Aid For Homeless During Democratic Convention," RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:  Philadelphia, host of the Democratic National Convention, spent part of its budget for that event on getting homeless people off the streets. The money paid for more outreach workers and shelter beds, at least temporarily. From member station WHYY in Philadelphia, Aaron Moselle reports. AARON MOSELLE, BYLINE: Focusing on the week before and the week of the convention, Philadelphia spent more than $60,000 on 110 beds in addition to the several thousand that already exist. Another $25,000 supported 17 additional outreach workers during the same span. For Joseph DeCosmo, those line items were priceless. Last week, he was living on the streets for the first time since losing his job at a pizza place. Now he's in a shelter after spotting outreach workers one night. JOSEPH DECOSMO: I was like, let me grab one of them right away. It was like an angel in disguise (laughter). MOSELLE: Liz Hersh runs the city's Office of Homeless Services. LIZ HERSH: In the first 10 days, they made over a thousand contacts with people on the street and were able to get about 15 percent of those into some kind of placement. MOSELLE: Sister Mary Scullion runs Project HOME. She's grateful the city provided additional resources. But now what? MARY SCULLION: I know Project HOME, you know, hopefully will be able to find a way for people to take those next steps forward, but I don't know that every other organization will have all the tools and resources they need. MOSELLE: In 2015, the city counted more than 6,000 homeless people. Roughly 700 of them sleep on the streets each night. For NPR News, I'm Aaron Moselle in Philadelphia. Copyright © 2016 NPR.

npr,"July 29, 2016",Biden Says Baton Rouge Officers' Deaths Had A Wide Impact," Now to a shocking attack here in the United States. Vice President Joe Biden was in Baton Rouge last night, speaking at a community memorial service for the three Louisiana law enforcement officers gunned down last week. NPR's Debbie Elliott reports. DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: This vigil was a final moment of reflection after the funerals of police officers Matthew Gerald and Montrell Jackson and sheriff's deputy Brad Garafola. The three were killed last week in what authorities say was an ambush. Vice President Joe Biden says it was an attack on society. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: When that assassin's bullet targeted our heroes - and he was an assassin - he not only targeted them. He targeted this city. He targeted this country. And it touched the soul of the entire nation. ELLIOTT: An investigation continues into what led a gunman from Kansas City to kill the Baton Rouge officers. He wounded three others before he was killed. One of them, deputy Nicholas Tullier, remains hospitalized in critical condition. Biden rejects the notion that Long was retaliating for the police killing of a local black man, Alton Sterling. It set off protests in Baton Rouge, much like demonstrations around the country over the police treatment of African-Americans. Biden is calling for a renewed investment in community policing to help close the distance between neighborhoods and law enforcement. Baton Rouge is still reeling from the events this month. The tension was pronounced at a meeting of the Metro Council this week, the first since the killings. QUEEN NEFERTITI: We're getting tired. We're getting tired. We're getting tired. We're getting tired of asking for justice. ELLIOTT: This young black woman, who goes by the name Queen Nefertiti, wore a sign around her neck that read I am Alton Sterling. She was frustrated when the council refused to consider requiring Baton Rouge police officers to live where they work. The vote split along racial lines. Afterward, community activist Gary Chambers said the council should have at least looked at it. GARY CHAMBERS: This is why we shout black lives matter, because when we come the right way, through democracy, to change laws, they deny us. ELLIOTT: The three officers who were killed lived in a neighboring community. Councilman Buddy Amoroso says now's not the time to consider the residency requirement. BUDDY AMOROSO: We're a hurting community. We're a fractured community. But we're not a broken community. I think we need time to heal. We need time for perspective. ELLIOTT: At the memorial, slain officer Montrell Jackson's widow, Trenisha, made an impassioned plea for racial healing. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRENISHA JACKSON: We all know Dr. Martin Luther King had a dream. Well, Corporal Montrell Jackson had a dream as well. His dream was for Baton Rouge, the city that he loved, to get better. I, too, have a dream that our nation will get better and unite as one. ELLIOTT: She had the audience rise, raise their right hands and vow not to let hate reside in their hearts. Debbie Elliott, NPR News, Baton Rouge. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"July 29, 2016",Hillary Clinton's Convention Balancing Act," (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: The chair will entertain a motion to adjourn this convention. Is there a second? All in favor say aye. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: Aye. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: No say nay. The ayes have it. We are adjourned. Thank you, Philadelphia. GREENE: Now, all week long here in Philadelphia, we have been listening to delegates at the convention. And yesterday, before Hillary Clinton's big acceptance speech, we asked some what they wanted to hear. Let's take a listen. ANJAN CHEMALADENA: My name is Anjan Chemaladena (ph). I'm from Chantilly, Va., and I'm a delegate for Hillary Clinton. GREENE: And what do you hope to hear from her this evening? CHEMALADENA: I would like to hear how we're going to come together, both Bernie Sanders supporters and Hillary supporters over the next three and a half months because definitely need Bernie Sanders supporters on our side, at least 90 percent of them. So I want to hear a plan for that action. ANDREA JONES: My name's Andrea Jones (ph). I'm from Sandusky, Ohio. And I really - I want to hear from Hillary, you know, not the usual political rhetoric. You know, I am her delegate, but I really think it's important that she says a message that transcends what, you know, is normally ascribed to Democrats. You know, I think the president last night sounded real Reagan-esque (ph) if that's a word. And I think that's a message that needs to resonate throughout our party. GREENE: You like the - you like the sound of that. JONES: Oh, absolutely, I mean, because my father's a pastor, so there are some conservative values that I just innately have. And there are plenty of people within our party that have them. You know, you can be for affirmative action and be pro-life. It's possible. TIM BUTTS: So I'm Tim Butts (ph), Houston, Texas. I hope to hear a game plan to beat Donald Trump, collaboration of the party coming together, the energy that came from the Bernie group, the battle for all of us in this room to move forward and do together. GREENE: But that kind of lofty language - I mean, if it's we need to move together from this building as one, I mean, that would send a message to you as a Bernie Sanders supporter, OK, she does want to bring us in. BUTTS: If it's a matter of we should move together or we would love to move together, yes. If it's a matter of you need to come over here and work with us, that's an entirely different piece of language. SUSAN BARRETT: OK. Susan Barrett (ph). GREENE: Where are you from? BARRETT: Fairfield, Conn., and tonight, I hope to hear Hillary's vision for all of us because she's into the we approach to this whole thing, and we're in this together. We're invested together. Is that Chris Matthews? Chris, I - excuse me. GREENE: Yup, that's right, Chris Matthews from MSNBC walked by and my interview was over. All right, but that would not happen to my colleague Mara Liasson. She was at the convention hall as well, and she has this recap. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: For a convention that started with efforts to placate Bernie Sanders supporters, it ended with Democrats opening their arms wide to Republicans and independents. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Chanting) USA. LIASSON: Last night, as the crowd waved big American flags and chanted USA, USA, retired Marine General John B. Allen delivered the kind of muscular speech that used to be a staple at Republican conventions. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOHN ALLEN: To our enemies, we will pursue you as only America can. You will fear us. And to ISIS and others, we will defeat you. LIASSON: The Democrats took every opening that Trump's divisive rhetoric offered them. There was a former Reagan administration official on stage, as well as families of slain police officers. Yesterday, at the very moment Donald Trump was in Iowa lamenting that the U.S. no longer waterboarded terrorists, the father of a Muslim American Army captain killed in Iraq was at the podium brandishing his pocket copy of the Constitution. In her speech, Hillary Clinton described the election as a stark, almost existential choice. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HILLARY CLINTON: Now America is once again at a moment of reckoning. Powerful forces are threatening to pull us apart. Bonds of trust and respect are fraying. And just as with our founders, there are no guarantees. It truly is up to us. We have to decide whether we will all work together so we can all rise together. LIASSON: Clinton offered an optimistic, confident vision, an alternative to what she called Trump's midnight in America pessimism. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CLINTON: Don't let anyone tell you that our country is weak. We're not. Don't let anyone tell you we don't have what it takes. We do. And most of all, don't believe anyone who says I alone can fix it. LIASSON: In contrast to Trump's description of a country consumed by fear, she told stories of communities coming together to fight violence. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CLINTON: Look at what happened in Dallas. After the assassinations of five brave police officers, Police Chief David Brown asked the community to support his force, maybe even join them. And do you know how the community responded? Nearly 500 people applied in just 12 days. LIASSON: Clinton had two big jobs to do - she had to take down Trump and reintroduce herself to a public who now views her as unfavorably as they do Donald Trump. She didn't reveal anything new about herself that might make it easier for voters to relate to her. But she did offer a tiny bit of introspection. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CLINTON: The truth is through all these years of public service, the service part has always come easier to me than the public part. I get it, that some people just don't know what to make of me. LIASSON: She tried to strike a balance between praising the progress of the Obama administration and acknowledging that many voters are not satisfied with the status quo. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CLINTON: And I've heard from many who feel like the economy sure isn't working for them. Some of you are frustrated, even furious. And you know what? You're right. LIASSON: She offered a summary of her plans for affordable college, criminal justice reform, health care and gun control. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CLINTON: I'm not here to take away your guns. I just don't want you to be shot by someone who shouldn't have a gun in the first place. LIASSON: But she kept coming back to the notion that Donald Trump was temperamentally unfit to keep the country safe. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CLINTON: I can't put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban missile crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started, not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men, the ones moved by fear and pride. LIASSON: American strength, she said, doesn't come from lashing out. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CLINTON: It relies on smarts, judgment, cool resolve and the precise and strategic application of power. And that's the kind of commander in chief I pledge to be. LIASSON: Hillary Clinton was asking Americans to trust her, to be level headed and steady. GREENE: All right. That was NPR's Mara Liasson. I'm joined in the studio here in Philadelphia by NPR national political correspondent Don Gonyea and also Janet Hook, who covers national politics for The Wall Street Journal. Good morning to you both. DON GONYEA, BYLINE: Good morning. JANET HOOK: Good morning. GREENE: So we heard there from Mara the two goals challenges for Hillary Clinton. One, take down Donald Trump; two, reintroduce herself. I suppose it's safe to say that was the goal of this week for the Democrats. I mean, Janet, did - what went right, what went wrong here for them? HOOK: Well, one of the things that went right for them was actually a third goal, kind of the foundation - the foundational goal they had was to unify the party. And what went right for them was how dramatically they managed to turn around a big problem they had with unity at the beginning of the week when... GREENE: You saw these dramatic moments with Bernie Sanders. HOOK: Dramatic moments with Bernie Sanders supporters. There was this real sense that the wheels were coming off of the party. And by the next day, things had really come together. It was like the convention had a personality transplant. It went from being really fractious to be - kind of coming together. I mean, part of it was of course that some of Bernie Sanders' supporters walked out, but they also kind of orchestrated a reunification of the party that was really pretty impressive so that by the end - now, granted though, there were still residual - and this is one thing that you don't know going forward how much the residual divisions remain. During Hillary Clinton's speech, you actually did hear Bernie Sanders supporters heckling from the rafters. GREENE: Which is a little bit of what went wrong, I guess, a bit last night... HOOK: A little bit of what went wrong. And, you know, the other thing that I'm not sure that they accomplished so much was kind of redefining Hillary Clinton or making her more approachable or accessible. One thing that voters right now are looking for is an authentic voice. And, you know, that was a good speech that Hillary Clinton gave, but for people who think that politicians sound like politicians, she kind of still sounded very scripted. GREENE: Don? GONYEA: In terms of what went right, they really wanted to create a huge contrast with what we saw in Cleveland last week. That was a very dark, kind of intensely negative event last week. And they wanted this to be more positive, more upbeat. I think it was related to that. They trolled Donald Trump pretty effectively. They did it in a playful way, sometimes in a very direct way. But they did it without the sort of, you know, lock her up stuff that we saw last week. The other side of it, I think, is more questions that remain at this point. You know, a lot of big set-piece speeches, we don't know in this year, in this climate, with voters' heads where they are if those kind of speeches work or if people even pay attention. GREENE: All right. I guess we'll be finding out in the weeks ahead. Janet Hook, Don Gonyea, thanks so much. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

For some people, the attack on police officers by a gunman in Dallas this summer brought to mind another attack by a sniper in Austin 50 years ago – on Aug. 1, 1966. That's when student Charles Whitman stuck his rifle over the edge of the clock tower at the University of Texas and started shooting. Ultimately, he killed 16 people — and wounded more than 30 others. For decades, people have struggled to figure out why. There have been theories about abuse, a brain tumor and, of course, mental illness. 
                Charles J. Whitman, a 25-year-old student at the University of Texas in 1966, killed his mother and wife before unleashing a barrage of bullets from a tower on the campus of the University of Texas at Austin.

 Charles J. Whitman, a 25-year-old student at the University of Texas in 1966, killed his mother and wife before unleashing a barrage of bullets from a tower on the campus of the University of Texas at Austin. Six months before Whitman took aim from that tower, he visited a school psychiatrist and admitted while there that he had a violent fantasy of going to the top of the tower with a deer rifle and shooting people. Gary Lavergne, who wrote A Sniper in the Tower, says the school psychiatrist, Dr. Maurice D. Heatly, claimed he'd had many students who recounted violent fantasies during therapy sessions. ""Today we take it a whole lot more seriously because of our history,"" Lavergne says. ""But back then, that kind of thing didn't happen."" Soon after the 1966 shooting, Heatly spoke in a news conference. ""It's a common experience for students who come to the mental hygiene clinic to refer to the tower as the site of some desperate action,"" Heatly told reporters. ""They say 'I feel like jumping off of the old tower.' [Charles Whitman had] no psychosis symptoms at all!"" Whitman never went back to the clinic but did return to his violent fantasy. Lavergne says the 25-year-old Marine veteran and Eagle Scout was incredibly methodical as he went about killing his mother the night before the tower shootings, placing her body in bed as if she were sleeping. Then he went back home and stabbed his wife. 
                The night before the tower shootings, Charles Whitman killed his mother in her bed, and left this note.

 The night before the tower shootings, Charles Whitman killed his mother in her bed, and left this note. ""By 3 o'clock in the morning, his wife and his mother are both murdered,"" says Lavergne. ""After that, until he goes to the campus, he spent the rest of his time polishing, getting weapons ready, buying more ammunition. All for the specific goal of going to the top of the UT tower and shooting people."" Nearly two hours later, 16 people were dead all-told, and 32 more were wounded. Police finally killed Whitman. Speaking to the media, John Connally, who was then governor of Texas, could barely find words. ""Of course I am concerned, disturbed, and yet somewhat at a loss to know how you prevent a maniacal act of a man who obviously goes berserk,"" Connally said. Fifty years later, when news about shootings in Dallas, in Orlando or San Bernardino hits, our reactions are much the same. We use different words, but we often assume the shooter is mentally ill, and that crimes like this could be avoided if those with serious mental illness didn't have guns. Which raises two questions: First, was Charles Whitman mentally ill? And second, could policies focusing on mental health prevent mass shootings? As to the first question, Lavergne doesn't think Whitman had serious mental illness. Whitman, he says, did have mental health challenges that are common – depression and anxiety. But more than anything, he was manipulative. ""He was always who he was expected to be,"" Lavergne says. ""In front of his father-in-law he at times appeared to be a dutiful husband, when — in fact — he assaulted his wife, just like his daddy assaulted his mother. And he gave people the impression he was an honor student, when — in fact — when he died he had a 1.9 grade point average."" Charles Whitman did seem to think something was wrong with him. This is an excerpt from a note he left on his wife's body: ""I don't really understand myself these days,"" he wrote. ""I'm supposed to be an average, reasonable and intelligent young man. However, lately, I can't recall when it started, I have been a victim of many unusual and irrational thoughts. These thoughts constantly recur."" Whitman didn't mention he'd also been abusing amphetamines. The potential impact of those chemicals fizzled out of the public conversation as soon as a pathologist made a striking discovery in his autopsy: a brain tumor. One doctor said the ""grayish yellow mass"" wasn't a factor in explaining what Whitman had done. But a medical panel later diagnosed the mass as a glioblastoma and said it could have contributed to Whitman's inability to control his emotions and his actions. Dr. Elizabeth Burton, a Dallas pathologist, agrees it's possible. ""You can have headaches, you can have seizures, and you can have changes in cognition, and you can actually have personality changes,"" she says. But plenty of people have tumors and are not violent. And plenty of people have depression, anxiety and paranoia and aren't violent. Dr. Paul Appelbaum, a psychiatrist and director of the division of law, ethics, and psychiatry at Columbia University, points out that only a tiny percent of violence – about 4 percent in the U.S. — is attributable to mental illness. ""We know that people with serious mental disorders are at somewhat elevated risk of committing violence,"" Appelbaum says. ""Even so, the vast majority of them never commit a violent act. And we know that people with serious mental illnesses are much more likely to end up as victims of violence rather than as perpetrators."" But Democrats and Republicans both tout mental health care legislation as a way of preventing mass shootings. After a shooter killed 20 children in Newtown, President Obama called for a gun crackdown. That didn't happen. But, Obama's 2017 budget does include $500 million for mental health services. Appelbaum says this is a misguided approach. ""We need more funding for treatment of people with mental illness in this country,"" Appelbaum says. ""But to argue for that funding on false grounds — namely to try and persuade the public that it will protect them [to] have more mental health clinics — in the long run can only backfire."" Applebaum believes there are alternatives. He says at least temporarily limiting access to guns for some people make sense. In general, people who have been convicted of violent misdemeanors, or who are a under temporary restraining order, or who have multiple DUI convictions over a 5-year period are more likely to commit acts of violence than people with mental illness are.

 Editor's note: This has been updated at 1:25 p.m. ET Friday with additional fact-checking information. Hillary Clinton accepted the Democratic nomination for president Thursday night, delivering a speech that lays out her plan to address terrorist threats and create jobs. NPR's politics team annotated Clinton's speech below. Portions commented on are highlighted, followed by analysis, context and fact check in italics. (You can read our fact check of Donald Trump's speech at the Republican National Convention last week here.) Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you all so so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you all very, very much. Thank you for that amazing welcome. Thank you all for the great convention that we've had. [A few thank yous at the top of a speech are not uncommon, but look at all the people Clinton thanks here at the top of her speech. This is something she does at every single campaign event. She thanks local elected officials, she thanks her top volunteers and campaign organizers by name. The scale and consistency of the thank yous are a trademark of Clinton's understated campaign style. –- Tamara Keith] And Chelsea, thank you. I'm so proud to be your mother and so proud of the woman you've become. Thank you for bringing Marc into our family, and Charlotte and Aidan into the world. And Bill, that conversation we started in the law library 45 years ago, it is still going strong. You know, that conversation has lasted through good times that filled us with joy, and hard times that tested us. And I've even gotten a few words in along the way. On Tuesday night, I was so happy to see that my explainer-in-chief is still on the job. I'm also grateful to the rest of my family and to the friends of a lifetime. For all of you whose hard work brought us here tonight, and to those of you who joined this campaign this week. Thank you. What a remarkable week it's been. We heard the man from Hope, Bill Clinton. [Bill Clinton grew up in Hope, Ark., and The Man From Hope is the title of a biographical film shown during the 1992 Democratic National Convention. The last line of Bill Clinton's acceptance speech in 1992 was: ""I end tonight where it all began for me: I still believe in a place called Hope."" — Danielle Kurtzleben] And the man of Hope, Barack Obama. America is stronger because of President Obama's leadership, and I'm better because of his friendship. We heard from our terrific vice president, the one and only Joe Biden. He spoke from his big heart about our party's commitment to working people, as only he can do. And first lady Michelle Obama reminded us that our children are watching, and the president we elect is going to be their president, too. And for those of you out there who are just getting to know Tim Kaine — you will soon understand why the people of Virginia keep promoting him: from city council and mayor, to governor, and now senator. And he will make the whole country proud as our vice president. And ... I want to thank Bernie Sanders. Bernie, Bernie, your campaign inspired millions of Americans, particularly the young people who threw their hearts and souls into our primary. [Sanders won 12 million votes in the Democratic primaries, to Clinton's 15.8 million, according to RealClearPolitics. And Clinton is right about young people's devotion to Sanders: As the Washington Post's Aaron Blake found, Sanders won more under-30 votes this primary season than Clinton and Trump combined. — Danielle Kurtzleben] You've put economic and social justice issues front and center, where they belong. And to all of your supporters here and around the country: I want you to know, I've heard you. Your cause is our cause. [After the speech, I spoke to several Sanders supporters in the arena who appreciated the acknowledgement but still weren't convinced that she really meant it. — Tamara Keith] Our country needs your ideas, energy and passion. That is the only way we can turn our progressive platform into real change for America. We wrote it together — now let's go out and make it happen together. My friends, we've come to Philadelphia — the birthplace of our nation — because what happened in this city 240 years ago still has something to teach us today. We all know the story. But we usually focus on how it turned out — and not enough on how close that story came to never being written at all. When representatives from 13 unruly colonies met just down the road from here, some wanted to stick with the king. And some wanted to stick it to the king. The revolution hung in the balance. Then somehow, they began listening to each other, compromising, finding common purpose. And by the time they left Philadelphia, they had begun to see themselves as one nation. That's what made it possible to stand up to a king. That took courage. They had courage. Our Founders embraced the enduring truth that we are stronger together. Now, now America is once again at a moment of reckoning. Powerful forces are threatening to pull us apart. Bonds of trust and respect are fraying. And just as with our founders, there are no guarantees. It truly is up to us. We have to decide whether we all will work together so we can all rise together. Our country's motto is ""e pluribus unum"": out of many, we are one. Will we stay true to that motto? Well, we heard Donald Trump's answer last week at his convention. He wants to divide us from the rest of the world, and from each other. He's betting that the perils of today's world will blind us to its unlimited promise. He's taken the Republican Party a long way from ""Morning in America"" to ""Midnight in America."" He wants us to fear the future and fear each other. Well, you know, a great Democratic President Franklin Delano Roosevelt came up with the perfect rebuke to Trump more than 80 years ago, during a much more perilous time: ""The only thing we have to fear is fear itself."" Now we are clear-eyed about what our country is up against. But we are not afraid. We will rise to the challenge, just as we always have. We will not build a wall. Instead, we will build an economy where everyone who wants a good job can get one. And we'll build a path to citizenship for millions of immigrants who are already contributing to our economy! We, we will not ban a religion. We will work with all Americans and our allies to fight and defeat terrorism. [Donald Trump initially called for a temporary ban on all Muslims entering the U.S. following the San Bernardino, Calif., terrorist attack last December. But he now talks about fighting terrorism through a temporary ban on people from countries with a known history of terrorism. — Tamara Keith] There's a lot of work to do. Too many people haven't had a pay raise since the crash. There's too much inequality. Too little social mobility. Too much paralysis in Washington. Too many threats at home and abroad. But just look for a minute at the strengths we bring as Americans to meet these challenges. We have the most dynamic and diverse people in the world. We have the most tolerant and generous young people we've ever had. We have the most powerful military. The most innovative entrepreneurs. The most enduring values: freedom and equality, justice and opportunity. We should be so proud that those words are associated with us. I have to tell you, as your secretary of state, I went to 112 countries. When people hear those words, they hear America. So don't let anyone tell you that our country is weak. We're not. Don't let anyone tell you we don't have what it takes. We do. And most of all, don't believe anyone who says, ""I alone can fix it."" Yes, those were actually Donald Trump's words in Cleveland. And they should set off alarm bells for all of us. Really? I alone can fix it? Isn't he forgetting? Troops on the front lines. Police officers and firefighters who run toward danger. Doctors and nurses who care for us. Teachers who change lives. Entrepreneurs who see possibilities in every problem. Mothers who lost children to violence and are building a movement to keep other kids safe. He's forgetting every last one of us. Americans don't say, ""I alone can fix it."" We say, ""We'll fix it together."" [In his convention speech, Trump did say ""I alone can fix it"" — he was referring to the political system he sees as broken. Clinton first used this line of attack the Friday after the GOP convention and it has been well-received by supporters ever since. Clinton is taking the phrase beyond Trump's original context, but there are certainly other instances in his convention speech and others where he has portrayed himself as the one who can fix various ills from ISIS to the economy. — Tamara Keith] And remember, remember: Our Founders fought a revolution and wrote a Constitution so America would never be a nation where one person had all the power. Two-hundred-and-forty years later, we still put our faith in each other. Look at what happened in Dallas after the assassinations of five brave police officers. Police Chief David Brown asked the community to support his force, maybe even join them. And you know how the community responded? Nearly 500 people applied in just 12 days. [According to data posted on the Dallas Police Department Facebook page, 467 people applied to the department between July 8 and July 20. That's more than triple the 136 people that applied between June 8 and June 20. — Danielle Kurtzleben] That's how Americans answer when the call for help goes out. Twenty years ago, I wrote a book called It Takes a Village. And a lot of people looked at the title and asked, ""What the heck do you mean by that?"" This is what I mean. None of us can raise a family, build a business, heal a community or lift a country totally alone. America needs every one of us to lend our energy, our talents, our ambition to making our nation better and stronger. I believe that with all my heart. That's why ""Stronger Together"" is not just a lesson from our history. It's not just a slogan for our campaign. It's a guiding principle for the country we've always been and the future we're going to build. A country where the economy works for everyone, not just those at the top. Where you can get a good job and send your kids to a good school, no matter what zip code you live in. A country where all our children can dream, and those dreams are within reach. Where families are strong, communities are safe, and yes, where love trumps hate. That's the country we're fighting for. That's the future we're working toward. And so, my friends, it is with humility, determination and boundless confidence in America's promise that I accept your nomination for president of the United States! Now, sometimes, sometimes the people at this podium are new to the national stage. As you know, I'm not one of those people. I've been your First Lady, served eight years as a senator from the great state of New York. Then I represented all of you as secretary of state. But my job titles only tell you what I've done. They don't tell you why. The truth is, through all these years of public service, the ""service"" part has always come easier to me than the ""public"" part. I get it that some people just don't know what to make of me. So let me tell you. The family I'm from, well, no one had their name on big buildings. My family were builders of a different kind. Builders in the way most American families are. They used whatever tools they had — whatever God gave them — and whatever life in America provided — and built better lives and better futures for their kids. My grandfather worked in the same Scranton lace mill for 50 years. Because he believed that if he gave everything he had, his children would have a better life than he did. And he was right. My dad, Hugh, made it to college. He played football at Penn State and enlisted in the Navy after Pearl Harbor. When the war was over, he started his own small business, printing fabric for draperies. I remember watching him stand for hours over silk screens. He wanted to give my brothers and me opportunities he never had. And he did. My mother, Dorothy, was abandoned by her parents as a young girl. Sheended up on her own at 14, working as a housemaid. She was saved by the kindness of others. Her first-grade teacher saw she had nothing to eat at lunch and brought extra food to share the entire year. The lesson she passed on to me, years later, stuck with me: No one gets through life alone. We have to look out for each other and lift each other up. And she made sure I learned the words from our Methodist faith: ""Do all the good you can, for all the people you can, in all the ways you can, as long as ever you can."" So, I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund, going door-to-door in New Bedford, Mass., on behalf of children with disabilities who were denied the chance to go to school. I remember meeting a young girl in a wheelchair on the small back porch of her house. She told me how badly she wanted to go to school — it just didn't seem possible in those days. And I couldn't stop thinking of my mother and what she'd gone through as a child. It became clear to me that simply caring is not enough. To drive real progress, you have to change both hearts and laws. You need both understanding and action. So we gathered facts. We built a coalition. And our work helped convince Congress to ensure access to education for all students with disabilities. It's a big idea, isn't it? Every kid with a disability has the right to go to school. But how, how do you make an idea like that real? You do it step-by-step, year-by-year, sometimes even door-by-door. My heart just swelled when I saw Anastasia Somoza representing millions of young people on this stage — because we changed our law to make sure she got an education. So it's true. I sweat the details of policy — whether we're talking about the exact level of lead in the drinking water in Flint, Mich., the number of mental health facilities in Iowa, or the cost of your prescription drugs. Because it's not just a detail if it's your kid — if it's your family. It's a big deal. And it should be a big deal to your president, too. After the four days of this convention, you've seen some of the people who've inspired me. People who let me into their lives, and became a part of mine. People like Ryan Moore and Lauren Manning. They told their stories Tuesday night. I first met Ryan as a 7-year-old. He was wearing a full body brace that must have weighed 40 pounds, because I leaned over to lift him up. Children like Ryan kept me going when our plan for universal health care failed and kept me working with leaders of both parties to help create the Children's Health Insurance Program that covers 8 million kids in our country. [CHIP had 8.1 million kids on the rolls as of 2015. And while Clinton wasn't in the legislature, she was instrumental in getting it passed, as PolitiFact found earlier this year. — Danielle Kurtzleben] Lauren Manning, who stood here with such grace and power, was gravely injured on 9/11. It was the thought of her, and Debbie St. John who you saw in the movie, and John Dolan and Joe Sweeney, and all the victims and survivors, that kept me working as hard as I could in the Senate on behalf of 9/11 families, and our first responders who got sick from their time at Ground Zero. I was thinking of Lauren, Debbie and all the others 10 years later in the White House Situation Room when President Obama made the courageous decision that finally brought Osama bin Laden to justice. And in this campaign, I've met many more people who motivate me to keep fighting for change. And, with your help, I will carry all of your voices and stories with me to the White House. And you heard, you heard from, from Republicans and Independents who are supporting our campaign. Well, I will be a president for Democrats, Republicans and independents, for the struggling, the striving, the successful, for all those who vote for me and for those who don't. For all Americans together. Tonight, tonight we've reached a milestone in our nation's march toward a more perfect union: the first time that a major party has nominated a woman for president. Standing here, standing here as my mother's daughter, and my daughter's mother, I'm so happy this day has come. I'm happy for grandmothers and little girls and everyone in between. I'm happy for boys and men, too — because when any barrier falls in America, it clears the way for everyone. After all, when there are no ceilings, the sky's the limit. So let's keep going, let's keep going until every one of the 161 million women and girls across America has the opportunity she deserves to have. But even more important than the history we make tonight, is the history we will write together in the years ahead. Let's begin with what we're going to do to help working people in our country get ahead and stay ahead. Now, I don't think President Obama and Vice President Biden get the credit they deserve for saving us from the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes. Our economy is so much stronger than when they took office. Nearly 15 million new private-sector jobs. Twenty million more Americans with health insurance. And an auto industry that just had its best year ever.  [The jobs-gain figure Clinton cites is from the trough, which came about a year after President Obama took office. The insurance figure includes those who gained coverage through new insurance exchanges, expansion of Medicaid, and changes in the private insurance market that allow young adults to stay on their parents' plan. U.S. auto sales hit 17.5 million last year, an all-time high. — Scott Horsley]  Now that's real progress, but none of us can be satisfied with the status quo. Not by a long shot. We're still facing deep-seated problems that developed long before the recession and have stayed with us through the recovery. I've gone around our country talking to working families. And I've heard from many who feel like the economy sure isn't working for them. Some of you are frustrated — even furious. And you know what? You're right. It's not yet working the way it should. Americans are willing to work — and work hard. But right now, an awful lot of people feel there is less and less respect for the work they do. And less respect for them, period. Democrats, we are the party of working people. But we haven't done a good enough job showing we get what you're going through, and we're going to do something to help. So tonight I want to tell you tonight how we will empower Americans to live better lives. My primary mission as president will be to create more opportunity and more good jobs with rising wages right here in the United States. From my first day in office to my last, especially in places that for too long have been left out and left behind. From our inner cities to our small towns, from Indian Country to Coal Country. From communities ravaged by addiction to regions hollowed out by plant closures. And here's what I believe. I believe America thrives when the middle class thrives. I believe that our economy isn't working the way it should because our democracy isn't working the way it should. That's why we need to appoint Supreme Court justices who will get money out of politics and expand voting rights, not restrict them. [With this oversimplified phrase, Clinton is effectively calling for court-mandated public financing, which is extremely unlikely. — Peter Overby] And if necessary, we will pass a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United.  [Passing a constitutional amendment would very likely be really, really, really hard in the current political climate of gridlock. Proposing one requires either a two-thirds vote of the House and Senate or a constitutional convention, which two-thirds of the states would have to call for, according to the National Archives. To be ratified, it requires 38 of the 50 states to approve it. — Danielle Kurtzleben] [And not even advocates of this one can agree on language that avoids other First Amendment issues. — Peter Overby] I believe American corporations that have gotten so much from our country should be just as patriotic in return. Many of them are. But too many aren't. It's wrong to take tax breaks with one hand and give out pink slips with the other. And I believe Wall Street can never, ever be allowed to wreck Main Street again. And I believe in science. I believe climate change is real and that we can save our planet while creating millions of good-paying clean energy jobs. I believe that when we have millions of hardworking immigrants contributing to our economy, it would be self-defeating and inhumane to try to kick them out. Comprehensive immigration reform will grow our economy and keep families together — and it's the right thing to do. [The Congressional Budget Office projected the immigration bill passed by the Senate in 2013 would boost the economy and reduce the federal deficit, while slightly reducing wages. — Scott Horsley] So, whatever party you belong to, or if you belong to no party at all, if you share these beliefs, this is your campaign. [This is part of Clinton's occasional outreach to both Sanders supporters and people she once called ""reasonable Republicans."" At the convention Thursday night, speakers included a former Ronald Reagan staffer and a woman who is leading a group of Republican women supporting Clinton. –- Tamara Keith] If you believe that companies should share profits with their workers, not pad executive bonuses, join us. If you believe the minimum wage should be a living wage, and no one working full time should have to raise their children in poverty, join us. If you believe that every man, woman and child in America has the right to affordable health care, join us. If you believe that we should say ""no"" to unfair trade deals, that we should stand up to China, that we should support our steelworkers and autoworkers and homegrown manufacturers, then join us. If you believe we should expand Social Security and protect a woman's right to make her own health care decisions, then join us. And yes, yes, if you believe that your working mother, wife, sister or daughter deserves equal pay, join us. That's how we're going to sure this economy works for everyone, not just those at the top. Now, you didn't hear any of this, did you, from Donald Trump at his convention. He spoke for 70-odd minutes — and I do mean odd. And he offered zero solutions. [Trump's acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland offered a number of measures to address the various problems he defined. They included Trump's ban on Muslims entering the United States, which he now describes as a proposal for the U.S. to ""suspend immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time as proven vetting mechanisms have been put in place."" Trump also reiterated his call for a border wall to combat illegal immigration, new trade policies (in addition to renegotiating ""bad trade agreements""), infrastructure investment and tax reform. Clinton has argued these proposals are wrong or not feasible, and therefore aren't solutions. But the statement suggests Trump's speech was devoid of specific proposals, which is not true. — Arnie Seipel] But we already know he doesn't believe these things. No wonder he doesn't like talking about his plans. You might have noticed, I love talking about mine. In my first hundred days, we will work with both parties to pass the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II. Jobs in manufacturing, clean energy, technology and innovation, small business, and infrastructure. If we invest in infrastructure now, we'll not only create jobs today, but lay the foundation for the jobs of the future. And we will also transform the way we prepare our young people for those jobs. Bernie Sanders and I will work together to make college tuition-free for the middle class and debt-free for all! [Clinton originally had a ""debt-free"" college plan, which was designed to ensure that people could attend college without taking out loans; that meant the student had to work and that the family would contribute what it could. But in July, she moved further in her primary rival Bernie Sanders' direction, proposing that college tuition at public universities for students from families making $125,000 or less (a threshold that would be phased in) would be free. — Danielle Kurtzleben] We will also, we will also liberate millions of people who already have student debt. It's just not right that Donald Trump can ignore his debts, and students and families can't refinance their debts. And something we don't say often enough: Sure, college is crucial, but a four-year degree should not be the only path to a good job.  [The income gap between high school and college grads is bigger for millennials than it was for Generation Xers, baby boomers and the Silent Generation, according to a 2014 Pew Research Center report. — Danielle Kurtzleben] We will help more people learn a skill or practice a trade and make a good living doing it. We will give small businesses like my dad's a boost. Make it easier to get credit. Way too many dreams die in the parking lots of banks. In America, if you can dream it, you should be able to build it. And we will help you balance family and work. And you know what, if fighting for affordable child care and paid family leave is playing the ""woman card,"" then deal me in. Now, here's the other thing, we're not only going to make all these investments, we're going to pay for every single one of them. And here's how: Wall Street, corporations, and the super-rich are going to start paying their fair share of taxes. This is not because we resent success, because when more than 90 percent of the gains have gone to the top 1 percent, that's where the money is, and we are going to follow the money. [In his convention speech, Bernie Sanders said something similar, saying that 85 percent of the income gains had gone to the top 1 percent — a stat that PolitiFact called ""half true"" because it was outdated. In 2014 and 2015, they write, the 99 percent's incomes recovered, and the top 1 percent's share fell to 52 percent. — Danielle Kurtzleben] And if companies take tax breaks and then ship jobs overseas, we'll make them pay us back. And we'll put that money to work where it belongs, creating jobs here at home! Now, now I imagine some of you are sitting at home thinking, well, that all sounds pretty good. But how are you going to get it done? How are you going to break through the gridlock in Washington? Well, look at my record. I've worked across the aisle to pass laws and treaties and to launch new programs that help millions of people. And if you give me the chance, that's what I'll do as president. But then I also imagine people are thinking out there, but Trump, he's a businessman. He must know something about the economy. Well, let's take a closer look. In Atlantic City, 60 miles from here, you will find contractors and small businesses who lost everything because Donald Trump refused to pay his bills. Now, remember what the president said last night: ""Don't boo, vote."" People who did the work and needed the money, and didn't get it — not because he couldn't pay them, but because he wouldn't pay them. He just stiffed them. [True. Specifically, she is referring to the losses suffered by contractors on the Taj Mahal casino. The Associated Press found that Trump owed $70 million to 253 contractors when the casino opened. After the casino filed for bankruptcy about a year later, many contractors got just 33 percent of what they were owed. As a result some went out of business.  [It's unclear whether Trump could have paid those bills, as Clinton argued. He was deeply overleveraged on the project, with extensive debt, and both his corporate and personal finances were in relatively poor shape at the time. — Matt Katz, WNYC] And you know that sales pitch he's making to be president? Put your faith in him — and you'll win big? That's the same sales pitch he made to all those small businesses. Then Trump walked away, and left working people holding the bag. He also talks a big game about putting America first. Well, please explain what part of ""America First"" leads him to make Trump ties in China, not Colorado. Trump suits in Mexico, not Michigan. Trump furniture in Turkey, not Ohio. Trump picture frames in India, not Wisconsin. Donald Trump says he wants to make America great again — well, he could start by actually making things in America again. Now, the choice we face in this election is just as stark when it comes to our national security. You know, anyone, anyone reading the news can see the threats and turbulence we face. From Baghdad to Kabul, to Nice and Paris and Brussels, from San Bernardino to Orlando, we're dealing with determined enemies that must be defeated. So, it's no wonder that people are anxious and looking for reassurance. Looking for steady leadership, wanting a leader who understands we are stronger when we work with our allies around the world and care for our veterans here at home. Keeping our nation safe and honoring the people who do that work will be my highest priority. I'm proud that we put a lid on Iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot — now we have to enforce it. And we must keep supporting Israel's security.  [Experts believe the agreement has lengthened the time Iran would need to develop a nuclear bomb from weeks or months to at least a year. However, the deal has had little effect on Iran's nonnuclear troublemaking elsewhere in the region. — Scott Horsley] I'm proud that we shaped a global climate agreement — now we have to hold every country accountable to their commitments, including ourselves. And I'm proud to stand by our allies in NATO against any threat they face, including from Russia. I've laid out my strategy for defeating ISIS. We will strike their sanctuaries from the air, and support local forces taking them out on the ground. We will surge our intelligence so that we detect and prevent attacks before they happen. We will disrupt their efforts online to reach and radicalize young people in our country. It won't be easy or quick, but make no mistake — we will prevail. Now Donald Trump, Donald Trump says, and this is a quote, ""I know more about ISIS than the generals do."" No, Donald, you don't. He thinks, he thinks that he knows more than our military because he claimed our armed forces are ""a disaster."" [Trump said, ""Our military is a disaster,"" in a debate in Charleston, S.C., hosted by the Fox Business Network on Jan. 14, 2016. — Arnie Seipel] Well, I've had the privilege to work closely with our troops and our veterans for many years, including as a senator on the Armed Services Committee, and I know how wrong he is. Our military is a national treasure. We entrust our commander in chief to make the hardest decisions our nation faces, decisions about war and peace, life and death. A president should respect the men and women who risk their lives to serve our country — including Captain Khan and the sons of Tim Kaine and Mike Pence, both Marines. So just ask yourself: Do you really think Donald Trump has the temperament to be commander in chief? Donald Trump can't even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When he's gotten a tough question from a reporter. When he's challenged in a debate. When he sees a protester at a rally. Imagine, if you dare, imagine, imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I can't put it, I can't put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started, not by big men with self-control and restraint, but by little men — the ones moved by fear and pride. America's strength doesn't come from lashing out. It relies on smarts, judgment, cool resolve, and the precise and strategic application of power. And that's the kind of commander in chief I pledge to be. And if we're serious about keeping our country safe, we also can't afford to have a president who's in the pocket of the gun lobby. I'm not here to repeal the Second Amendment. I'm not here to take away your guns. I just don't want you to be shot by someone who shouldn't have a gun in the first place. We will work tirelessly with responsible gun owners to pass common-sense reforms and keep guns out of the hands of criminals, terrorists and all others who would do us harm. You know, for decades, people have said this issue was too hard to solve and the politics too hot to touch. But I ask you: How can we just stand by and do nothing? You heard, you saw, family members of people killed by gun violence on this stage. You heard, you saw, family members of police officers killed in the line of duty because they were outgunned by criminals. I refuse to believe we can't find common ground here. We have to heal the divides in our country. Not just on guns. But on race. Immigration. And more. And that starts with listening, listening to each other. Trying, as best we can, to walk in each other's shoes. So let's put ourselves in the shoes of young black and Latino men and women who face the effects of systemic racism, and are made to feel like their lives are disposable. Let's put ourselves in the shoes of police officers, kissing their kids and spouses goodbye every day, heading off to do a dangerous and necessary job. We will reform our criminal justice system from end to end and rebuild trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve. And we will defend, we will defend all our rights — civil rights, human rights and voting rights, women's rights and workers' rights, LGBT rights and the rights of people with disabilities! And we will stand up against mean and divisive rhetoric wherever it comes from. You know, for the past year, many people made the mistake of laughing off Donald Trump's comments — excusing him as an entertainer just putting on a show. They thought he couldn't possibly mean all the horrible things he says — like when he called women ""pigs."" Or said that an American judge couldn't be fair because of his Mexican heritage. Or when he mocks and mimics a reporter with a disability. Or insults prisoners of war like John McCain — a true hero and patriot who deserves our respect. Now, at first, at first, I admit, I couldn't believe he meant it either. It was just too hard to fathom — that someone who wants to lead our nation could say those things. Could be like that. But here's the sad truth: There is no other Donald Trump. This is it. And in the end, it comes down to what Donald Trump doesn't get: that America is great — because America is good. [After Clinton's speech, there were claims on Twitter that this quote was lifted from Alexis de Tocqueville's Democracy in America. Interestingly, the Weekly Standard found in 1995 that it is a line of unknown provenance, often misattributed to de Tocqueville. Reagan used it (by way, his speechwriters said, of Eisenhower), as well as Pat Buchanan and Bill Clinton, the Weekly Standard wrote. — Danielle Kurtzleben] So enough with the bigotry and bombast. Donald Trump's not offering real change. He's offering empty promises. And what are we offering? A bold agenda to improve the lives of people across our country — to keep you safe, to get you good jobs, and to give your kids the opportunities they deserve. The choice is clear, my friends. Every generation of Americans has come together to make our country freer, fairer and stronger. None of us ever have or can do it alone. I know that at a time when so much seems to be pulling us apart, it can be hard to imagine how we'll ever pull together. But I'm here to tell you tonight — progress is possible. I know, I know because I've seen it in the lives of people across America who get knocked down and get right back up. And I know it, I know it from my own life. More than a few times, I've had to pick myself up and get back in the game. Like so much else in my life, I got this from my mother too. She never let me back down from any challenge. When I tried to hide from a neighborhood bully, she literally blocked the door. ""Go back out there,"" she said. And she was right. You have to stand up to bullies. You have to keep working to make things better, even when the odds are long and the opposition is fierce. We lost our mother a few years ago, but I miss her every day. And I still hear her voice urging me to keep working, keep fighting for right, no matter what. That's what we need to do together as a nation. Though ""we may not live to see the glory,"" as the song from the musical Hamilton goes, ""let us gladly join the fight."" Let our legacy be about ""planting seeds in a garden you never get to see."" That's why we're here ... not just in this hall, but on this Earth. The Founders showed us that. And so have many others since. They were drawn together by love of country, and the selfless passion to build something better for all who follow. That is the story of America. And we begin a new chapter tonight. Yes, the world is watching what we do. Yes, America's destiny is ours to choose. So let's be stronger together, my fellow Americans. Let's look to the future with courage and confidence. Let's build a better tomorrow for our beloved children and our beloved country. And when we do, America will be greater than ever. Thank you, and may God bless you and the United States of America!

Go look at the graves of brave patriots who died defending the United States of America. You will see all faiths, genders and ethnicities. You have sacrificed nothing and no one."" Khan is the father of Capt. Humayun Khan, a 27-year-old killed while serving in Iraq in 2004. The elder Khan moved to the United States nearly 40 years ago. His son attended the University of Virginia, participating in ROTC before he joined the Army after graduation. At the convention, Khan told Muslim immigrants and all immigrants to take the upcoming election seriously. He evoked the memory of his son: ""This is a historic election and I request to honor the sacrifice of my son, and on Election Day, take the time to get out and vote and vote for the healer, vote for the strongest, most qualified candidate, Hillary Clinton, not the divider."" Khan spoke directly to Trump, in response to Trump's calls to ban Muslims and immigrants from countries with a ""proven history of terrorism.""

npr,"July 28, 2016",Under Pressure: This Could Be The Most Important Speech Of Hillary Clinton's Life," Hillary Clinton is no stranger to speaking at political conventions — she has done it four times before. But nothing will compare to the pressure and sky-high expectations she faces tonight when she will accept the Democratic nomination for president, becoming the first woman of a major political party ever to do so. She is expected to hit opponent Donald Trump but also lay out her own vision for America — likely a more positive take on the country than her GOP rival, and more in the style of President Obama's speech Wednesday night. Clinton also has the difficult task of trying to reintroduce herself, a daunting task for someone who has been in the national public eye for more than two decades. If past is prologue, here's a look back at her previous DNC speeches — and what they could tell us about what she might say tonight. Clinton didn't speak in 1992 when her husband was first nominated as a presidential candidate. But four years later, the first lady did take the stage to defend both herself and Bill Clinton. The New York Times wrote: ""With a feathery touch but clear political intent, Hillary Rodham Clinton responded today to the critics of her four-year stint as First Lady by drawing on the imagery of strong women from an earlier era who battled withering criticism in their day."" There were initial questions of whether it was even a good idea for Clinton to speak. She was a polarizing figure even then, wielding unprecedented influence in her husband's administration, and was embroiled in the Whitewater controversy. She spoke about family and children, coming just off the publication of her book, It Takes a Village: And Other Lessons Children Teach Us. ""It takes a president who believes not only in the potential of his own child, but of all children; who believes not only in the strength of his own family, but of the American family,"" the first lady said. ""It takes Bill Clinton."" This was the first time she addressed the DNC as a political candidate, an outgoing first lady running for an open U.S. Senate seat from New York that fall. She focused much of her speech on extolling the nominee that year, Vice President Al Gore, praising him as ""Bill's trusted partner."" But she also looked back at her family's last eight years and what the future held: ""Bill and I are closing one chapter of our lives — and soon, we'll be starting a new one. For me, it will be up to the people of New York to decide whether I'll have the privilege of serving them in the United States Senate. I will always be profoundly grateful to all of you and to the American people for the last eight years."" Four years later, Clinton was the junior senator from New York and already being mentioned as a possible future presidential candidate. Initially, she wasn't supposed to speak on her own, reportedly amid worries she might upstage that year's ticket of John Edwards and John Kerry. But that quickly changed, and she was given a prominent role introducing her husband. ""Twelve years ago, when our country needed new leadership, Americans selected a Democrat who gave us eight years of peace, prosperity and promise. Tonight, I have the pleasure of introducing the last great Democratic president,"" she said, before talking about Kerry, who she predicted would be ""the next great Democratic president."" She also spoke of how the country had changed since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, telling the crowd, ""We meet at a moment of great peril, but also of great promise for the country we love."" Clinton continued, ""Together we can once again widen the circle of opportunity for all Americans, we can once again transcend our differences and divisions, we can once again give our children a safer and more secure future."" But at that convention, she was upstaged by a young Senate candidate from Illinois — a foreshadowing of what was to come four years later. Clinton was not accepting the Democratic nomination at this convention, as she had hoped to do. Instead, after a bitter primary battle with that young Illinois Senate candidate, she put aside their past differences. NPR's Mara Liasson reported: ""Hillary Clinton delivered an impassioned plea for party unity in a forceful address to the Democratic National Convention Tuesday night, declaring, 'Barack Obama is my candidate and he must be our president.' "" Clinton said: ""My friends, it is time to take back the country we love. Whether you voted for me, or voted for Barack, the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose. We are on the same team, and none of us can sit on the sidelines. This is a fight for the future. And it's a fight we must win."" Clinton didn't speak before the 2012 Democratic convention, because she was on an overseas trip as the secretary of state at the time.

npr,"July 28, 2016","At The Democratic Convention, Choreographing A Sea Of Signs"," If you've been watching the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia on TV, you've probably seen it happen a few times already: Every few minutes, a fresh wave of brightly colored signs — bearing campaign slogans like ""Stronger Together"" or ""Love Trumps Hate"" — spreads across the convention floor like wildfire. Shelly Loos is in charge of floor operations for the DNC. And it's her job to oversee the timing and distribution of the 300,000 to 400,000 signs at the convention, and the some 200 ""runners"" — volunteers running up and down the aisles handing out stacks of signs to delegates. Unlike when Loos was a runner in 1992 — and the volunteers communicated via radio — Loos gives the ""go"" via mass text to ""captains."" Her gig isn't without peril. This week supporters of Bernie Sanders showed their frustration by striking out Hillary Clinton's name or otherwise defacing the placards. ""I don't love it,"" she says, adding that ""this is a convention and we accept other people's views."" Use the audio link above to hear the full story. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  This is the final day of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. And if you've been watching at home on television, you've probably seen the crowd lifting brightly colored signs that seem to magically change, depending on what's happening. One moment there is signs with campaign slogans like stronger together or love trumps hate. And then suddenly, there are new ones bearing the name of the speaker on the stage. Well, our colleague Audie Cornish has more on how it all happens. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  Storing this many signs involves black trash bags, so many trash bags. SHELLY LOOS: Between 300 and 400,000 signs. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Madam Secretary... LOOS: It's crazy, but... UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: ...We are Ohio. LOOS: ...It's awesome. CORNISH: This is Shelly Loos. She's in charge of floor operations for the DNC. She says they've got these bags socked away in storage spaces all over the arena, not to mention the four freight storage pods in the parking lot. We found her backstage Tuesday, the night of the historic roll call vote that made Hillary Clinton the Democratic nominee. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Puerto Rico, you have 67 votes. How do you cast your votes? CORNISH: Loos is wearing a black sleeveless T-shirt, dark jeans and black boots, but not the neon yellow vest her 200 runners have dawned for the night. You can see those volunteers on TV awning up and down the aisles, handing out stacks of signs to delegates. LOOS: We set a - sort of a ready, set, go timeline. And when they get their go cue, they run them out, and they run back and get more. And they run them out. CORNISH: Unlike when she was a runner back in 1992 and the volunteers communicated via radio, tonight, Loos gives the go via mass text to captains. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Two minutes to ready. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: Two minutes to ready. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: Just go to the ready spot, all right? Don't go out on the floor. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #5: Just stand by the curtain. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #6: Please wait 'til I give you the signal to go out. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: South Carolina. (CHEERING) CORNISH: These are the moments Loos lives for. And this operation plays out over and over again over the course of a night. But her gig is not without peril. This week, Bernie Sanders supporters showed their frustration by striking out Clinton's name or otherwise defacing the placards. LOOS: I don't love it, but I also think that this is a convention, and we accept other people's views. Like basically all these people have the same ideals. CORNISH: And Loos can't worry about that. Right now she's trying to match the pace of the roll call vote. Thousands of green, blue and red signs with Clinton's signature H and arrow logo spread like wildfire across the convention floor. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MARCIA FUDGE: To suspend the rules and nominate Hillary Clinton by acclamation as the presidential candidate of the Democratic Party.

npr,"July 28, 2016",California Gov. Jerry Brown On The Power Of Outsider Politics," California Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, has been in politics since the 1960s, and launched multiple runs for president himself. In 1992, he ran as the outsider candidate — chastising the incumbent parties that had ""failed their duty."" ""They've placed their own interest about the national interest,"" he said during the speech that kicked off his campaign. They've allowed themselves to be trapped and in some cases corrupted by the powerful forces of greed. It's time for them go!"" Today, Brown says that anti-establishment energy is central to the current presidential campaign — not just for Bernie Sanders, he argues, but Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump as well. ""Everybody who's running for office in some way has to capture the mood of discontent and skepticism about the incumbent party,"" he tells NPR's Audie Cornish. ""Certainly Mr. Trump is gonna try to capture as much of that as he can. But if you look at the two of them, Trump is the fellow who stiffed his subcontractors, went through bankruptcy and has focused his whole life on making money, or having a television show, or running a beauty pageant,"" Brown says. ""When you contrast that with Hillary's vast experience, the choice couldn't be clearer."" Although Clinton supporters have repeatedly made that argument, she still needs to present herself in a way that convinces more skeptical voters, Brown acknowledges. Looking ahead, Brown says Democrats must engage in ""creative intervention"" — in areas such as the minimum wage, family leave, childcare and education — to ensure the party doesn't lose working-class voters forever. Use the audio link above to hear the full conversation. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  Now, earlier today I spoke with California Governor Jerry Brown about what Hillary Clinton hopes to achieve with tonight's speech. He has been in politics since the 1960s and even launched multiple runs for president himself. And then in 1992, he ran as the outsider candidate. And I played him a clip of the speech that kicked off that campaign. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JERRY BROWN: The leaders of Washington's incumbent party, both Democrats and Republicans, have failed their duty. They've placed their own interests above the national interests. They have allowed themselves to be trapped and in some cases corrupted by the powerful forces of greed. It's time for them to go. (CHEERING, APPLAUSE) CORNISH: It seems like you were really channeling that anti-establishment energy that we heard again this year. And what are the parallels you see today? BROWN: Well, that was said right here in Philadelphia just a few blocks from where we're sitting. And the perspective is that Washington is captured by all these alien forces and that we the people have to take it back. That was part of the message of Bernie Sanders, but it's also increasingly part of the message of Hillary Clinton. And it's a perennial. CORNISH: It's also a message from Donald Trump - right? - in many ways. BROWN: Well, because it is the message, so everybody who's running for office in some way has to capture the mood of discontent and skepticism about the incumbent party, which, by the way, is Republican in the Congress, Democrat in the White House. Certainly Mr. Trump is going to try to capture as much of that as he can. But if you look at the two of them, Trump is the fellow who stiffed his subcontractors, went through bankruptcy and has focused his whole life on making money or having a television show or running a beauty pageant. So when you contrast that with Hillary's vast experience, the choice couldn't be clearer. CORNISH: You know, you're pointing out an argument that we're hearing from Democrats over and over about Hillary Clinton's resume compared to Donald Trump's, that there's not a comparison there. But the race is close. This is not some sort of cakewalk for her right now. BROWN: No, not at all. It's a very competitive race, and... CORNISH: But does that mean that argument is not working? BROWN: Well, it - look; I think this campaign is a real boost, and she definitely has to present herself in a way that touches those more skeptical voters. CORNISH: People have been talking a lot this election cycle about the white, working-class vote and the support there for Republicans. Have Democrats lost this group forever? BROWN: Well, it's always this - it's a concern. The non-college-graduate, a real foundation of the American society, has not done well in the global environment of more and more trade, the technology that's transforming our economy. Everybody knows that the globalization increases overall wealth, but it does increase overall inequality. Then the question is, how do you deal with that? Well just more unconstrained capitalism is not going to help the white working class or the black working class or anybody that isn't in the hallways of power and affluence - so I say a creative intervention in the minimum wage, on family leave, on childcare, on good schools, on all that part of the public sector that enriches life. CORNISH: People talk about Democrats having to get voter turnout from what they call the Obama coalition, a multi-racial coalition of voters. You come from a state where the demographics are favorable to Democrats in some ways. And are Democrats kind of relying on that? BROWN: You know, you can't really rely on micro-targeting to chop and dice the American people into little categories that you then appeal to very specific, tailored messages. There has to be an overarching vision for America that we're all a part of. We're not all just demographics, and there's a lot of that. You know, these terms like boomer, gen X, millennial - these are advertising terms. And as a political person, you have to think in much larger terms than advertising. You have to think in the human experience of America, our history, our future together. And I think Hillary is in a very strong position to do that. CORNISH: Governor Jerry Brown, thank you so much for speaking with us. BROWN: OK, thank you very much. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"July 28, 2016","The Labor Secretary On Trade, Jobs And What Democrats Offer Voters"," TOM PEREZ: I think we've always had viewpoint diversity on issues of trade. You go back to just about every trade agreement. There have been Republicans who've supported it, Republicans who've opposed it, Democrats who've supported it, Democrats who've opposed it. Here's where I think there's a lot of common ground. The North Star for President Obama and other progressives is, we want to make sure there's a level playing field for workers, and that is where I think there's widespread agree. The challenge is to make sure we get there. NAFTA, for instance, was a trade agreement that was well-intentioned, but it was promises made and not promises kept. Can we learn from the lessons and mistakes of history? That's really the discussion that we're having in the context of trade now. CORNISH: All week we've heard Democrats basically tout the economic growth of the last eight years, but there's evidence this year, especially with working-class voters, that basically they're not buying it, that they feel like it is harder to move into the middle class, that they're not satisfied with the last eight years in terms of their economic prospects. Why do you think that is? PEREZ: Well, actually, I think it's important to level set where we were, where we've come, where we need to go, and where we were when this president took over was the economy was in the worst ditch of our lifetime - 2.4 million jobs lost in the three months before the president got there. The... CORNISH: But that seems to be the argument that's being rejected - right? - like, saying, well, hey, it's better than it could have been. PEREZ: Well, I don't think it's - no, I think what - here's the bottom line. The president inherited a mess. The Democrats in Congress have moved forward - 14.8 million jobs created over the last 70 months. If you want to grow jobs, elect a Democrat. The unfinished business of this recovery is to make sure that the progress we've made results in shared prosperity, and that's what Hillary Clinton is all about. CORNISH: What does she have to accomplish in this speech tonight? Is it about policy? Is it about addressing voters who question her integrity? What do you think she needs to say? PEREZ: Well, I think she's going to articulate a very optimistic vision of an America that can work for everyone. She's going to acknowledge where we were, where we've come and where we need to go, and she has a very, very wide-ranging and inclusive vision, a vision that understands that we leave no ZIP code behind, a vision that understands that every person is gifted and talented and we need to draw out those gifts and talents, a vision that understands that it's a false choice to suggest that we either keep our streets safe or we respect the Constitution. We can do both. CORNISH: One thing - I shouldn't let you go before asking about the vice presidential pick because there were a lot of voters, some Latino voters, who had an eye on your name being on the short list, Julian Castro being on the short list. Is there going to be a time where we see Latino politicians make real gains on this level the way we were seeing it on the Republican side, right? There were... PEREZ: Well... CORNISH: There were several candidates there running. PEREZ: Well, let's be clear. In one hour this Monday night at the Democratic convention, there were more Latinos who spoke than in the entire Republican Convention of last week. I thought after 2012 - they did this report, the Republican Party, saying, we've got to reach out to Latinos. They have a very unique Latino outreach strategy. Let's just call it that. And when you belittle and demean Mexicans, when you belittle and frighten Muslims - not a very effective strategy. And so I've been proud to be a Democrat, and I think Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine are a home run ticket. They are workhorses. They're not show horses. And they have a proven track record not only with the Latino community but across America. CORNISH: Well, Tom Perez, thank you so much for sitting down to speak with us. PEREZ: Great to be with you, Audie. CORNISH: Tom Perez serves in the Obama administration as labor secretary. He spoke with us here at the DNC in Philadelphia. Copyright © 2016 NPR.

npr,"July 28, 2016",The Task Ahead Of Hillary Clinton On The DNC's Final Night," With Day 4 of the Democratic National Convention set to kick off, Hillary Clinton's headlining speech is the main attraction — but it's by no means the only story line swirling on the final night. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  Many Democratic Party heavy hitters have made their way onto the stage this week, from former President Bill Clinton to Vice President Biden to President Obama, all making the case on behalf of Hillary Clinton. Now it's her turn. Tonight Clinton will formally accept the party's nomination for president and deliver what could be the most important speech of her political career. Joining me now is NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Hey there, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Audie. CORNISH: And next to me, NPR's Tamara Keith - she's been covering the Clinton campaign since day one. Hey there, Tam. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Hello. CORNISH: Now, what can you tell us about how she's been preparing for her speech tonight and what Hillary Clinton might actually say? KEITH: Well, according to a campaign aide, she's been thinking about it for several weeks, sending ideas to aides as they've been working on it. Last night after she came out onstage with President Obama, they say she actually went back to her hotel to get back to work on the speech late last night. They expect her to work on it all day today in typical Clinton fashion. We will not get remarks until the very last minute if we get them at all. And the themes that they expect her to hit are this theme that was in her book in 1996. It takes a village. They see her stronger together - campaign slogan as an extension of that. CORNISH: All right, we know what might happen here, but Mara, what does she actually need to accomplish? LIASSON: She needs to accomplish a lot. This is a very high-stakes speech. This is a night she has to reach into herself and reveal something about herself, take her life story and connect it to her vision for America, not just tell us about her five-point plans. She also has to provide a unifying theme for all the things she wants to do. I don't think that she can turn around her honesty and trustworthiness problems with one speech, but she could present herself tonight as more relatable, give people a glimpse of that warm, funny woman the people who meet her in small groups and one-on-one say that she is. And you know, Peter Hart, who's a pollster that's - who's done many focus groups about Hillary Clinton, talks about a glass curtain. She talks about the glass ceiling. He says voters feel there's a glass curtain between themselves and Hillary Clinton. They can't relate to her. They feel they don't really understand her, and that's made it easier for her opponents, of which there have been many over many years, to define her the way they want to. CORNISH: All right - glass curtain - that's a new one for me (laughter). Tamara, is this a heavy lift based on what you've seen of Hillary Clinton on the trail? KEITH: Well, even she has talked about not being a natural campaigner. And she has this big shadow because her husband, the former president, and President Obama both are natural campaigners. And so this is a challenge for her. She - she's also - she - as Mara talks about, she sometimes struggles with the big theme. She loves talking about her plans, and she often is very focused on sort of the smaller things that could be quite valuable in governing but aren't so good in big speechmaking. CORNISH: Now, we're forgetting here that this is a moment of historical significance, right? I mean Hillary Clinton will be the first woman to lead a major party ticket. How does she factor that in? KEITH: So earlier this week, she was at the VFW convention, and she had this line in her speech that I think gets at the some of her discomfort with this. She says I know that this is the first time that one of our two major parties has ever nominated a woman, and that takes some getting used to even for me. And I think that she has to somehow figure out a way to talk about it. She doesn't like being a symbol, but in many ways, that's what tonight is about. LIASSON: You know, everyone I've talked to here says don't overplay the historic moment theme. It works with older women, many of whom are in the hall, doesn't necessarily work with younger women. It's also been talked about a lot this week. They say she needs to build on the solid foundation that the president and the vice president and Michelle Obama gave her this week. It doesn't matter if their speeches are better if she can bring something up out of herself. CORNISH: And Mara, before I let you go, who are the other speakers that are notable tonight? LIASSON: Well, you know, what's interesting tonight - there's a section - a tribute to fallen law enforcement officers. They're going to honor the police. This is something that the Democrats have been criticized for omitting, but here it is. So in addition to the Mothers of the Movement, the mothers of unarmed children who killed by police officers, we're also going to hear about fallen law enforcement officers. And we'll hear from family members of a solider, 1 of the 14 American-Muslims soldiers killed serving in the United States military since 9/11. We'll also hear from Chelsea Clinton, who will introduce her mother and... CORNISH: Mara, I'm going to stop you there. LIASSON: ...Katy Perry. CORNISH: (Laughter) OK. KEITH: Katy Perry - yes. LIASSON: Katy Perry - there's always an entertainer. CORNISH: The kicker - NPR's Mara Liasson and Tamara Keith, thanks so much. KEITH: You're welcome. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"July 28, 2016",A Look Back At Obama's Past Convention Speeches," ""And that's why I can say with confidence there has never been a man or a woman, not me, not Bill, nobody, more qualified than Hillary Clinton to serve as president of the United States of America."" Obama's remarks Wednesday contrasted with the speeches delivered at the Republican National Convention last week. (This might not come as a surprise since partisans' views of the opposing party are the most negative they've been in nearly a quarter century.) ""The irresponsible rhetoric of our president, who has used the pulpit of the presidency to divide us by race and color, has made America a more dangerous environment that frankly that I have ever seen of anybody in this room has ever watched or seen,"" Trump said in his own acceptance speech, arguing that only he alone could restore law and order to the nation. Obama struck a vastly different tone, proclaiming, ""America is already great. America is already strong."" It was 12 years ago that America was first introduced to the then-little-known Illinois Senate hopeful whose soaring oratory at the 2004 Democratic convention thrust him into the national spotlight. ""And it's true — I was so young that first time in Boston. And look, I'll admit it, maybe I was a little nervous addressing such a big crowd,"" Obama recalled on Wednesday. ""But I was filled with faith; faith in America — the generous, big-hearted, hopeful country that made my story — that made all of our stories — possible."" Just four years later, he would be standing before the convention accepting the Democratic nomination, and again four years later for renomination. In all those speeches, Obama seems to carry a similar theme: all for one and one for all. (And Obama also seems to be a U2 fan because he has come out to their song ""City of Blinding Lights"" at every DNC since 2008.) Watch his speeches below: ""If there's a child on the South Side of Chicago who can't read, that matters to me, even if it's not my child. ""If there's a senior citizen somewhere who can't pay for their prescription and having to choose between medicine and the rent, that makes my life poorer, even if it's not my grandparent. ""If there's an Arab-American family being rounded up without benefit of an attorney or due process, that threatens my civil liberties. ""It is that fundamental belief — it is that fundamental belief — I am my brothers' keeper, I am my sisters' keeper — that makes this country work. ""It's what allows us to pursue our individual dreams, yet still come together as a single American family: 'E pluribus unum,' out of many, one."" ""And it is that promise that, 45 years ago today, brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington, before Lincoln's Memorial, and hear a young preacher speak of his dream. ""The men and women who gathered there could've heard many things. They could've heard words of anger and discord. They could've been told to succumb to the fear and frustrations of so many dreams deferred. ""But what people heard instead — people of every creed and color, from every walk of life — is that, in America, our destiny is inextricably linked, that together our dreams can be one."" ""We, the people — recognize that we have responsibilities as well as rights; that our destinies are bound together; that a freedom which asks only, what's in it for me, a freedom without a commitment to others, a freedom without love or charity or duty or patriotism, is unworthy of our founding ideals, and those who died in their defense. ""As citizens, we understand that America is not about what can be done for us. It's about what can be done by us, together — through the hard and frustrating but necessary work for self-government. That's what we believe."" ""What makes us American, what makes us patriots, is what's in here. That's what matters. And that's why we can take the food and music and holidays and styles of other countries, and blend it into something uniquely our own. That's why we can attract strivers and entrepreneurs from around the globe to build new factories and create new industries here. That's why our military can look the way it does, every shade of humanity, forged into common service. That's why anyone who threatens our values, whether fascists or communists or jihadists or homegrown demagogues, will always fail in the end. ""That is America. That is America. Those bonds of affection; that common creed. We don't fear the future; we shape it, we embrace it, as one people, stronger together than we are on our own.""

npr,"December 31, 2016",Syria And Russia Among Major International Stories Of 2016," ABDERRAHIM FOUKARA: Same to you. Thank you. MARTIN: Now, as I - you know, there are as many lists as there are news organizations and journalists about the biggest stories of the year, so we want your perspective on the biggest international stories of the year. FOUKARA: Well, probably Syria is right up there, the fact that the Russians have helped the Syrian president re-establish control over Aleppo. And that's been bolstered by, you know, the ceasefire throughout Syrian territory except parts of Syria controlled by some groups considered by the Russians and others as terrorist groups. That's going to have implications for all the neighbors but particularly a neighbor like Turkey right across the border from Syria. MARTIN: We want to talk about Russia for a second - their role in the Syrian war. The country has been very much on the minds of Americans with the alleged hacking, the incoming president's seeming warmth toward Vladimir Putin. And now we have President Obama in the waning days of his presidency using his executive power to expel 35 Russian diplomats. Give us your take on this and how you see that - the U.S. and Russian relationship going forward. FOUKARA: Given, you know, the complexities of the world that both Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump will be operating in, it seems to me that that's going to be a short-lived honeymoon once Trump actually gets into office. When President Obama announced sanctions against Russia, we've already seen how Donald Trump has reacted to that, but especially we've seen how Vladimir Putin has reacted to it, saying, I'm not going to resort to tit for tat. I'm going to wait until Trump is in office. But the realities and the complexities of the world probably tell me that maybe in a year's time, we'll see Putin and Trump going in a different direction. MARTIN: Well, going forward, then, what are the big international stories that you will be keeping your eye on in 2017? FOUKARA: Definitely Syria - also the fight against the Islamic State in Iraq. When the battle to liberate Mosul started, there was some prediction that by the time Donald Trump or the next president - it was said at that time - takes over from Barack Obama, the fight will be mostly over. We have found out that the battle to liberate Mosul is proving much more complicated than originally predicted. So Iraq is going to stay right up there in terms of the order of priorities. I also see the relationship between the Israelis and the Palestinians and how it impacts major powers such as the United States. I also see that as coming back to some sort of attention, particularly in the wake of the resolution against Israeli settlement in the Palestinian territories at the United Nations Security Council. So you know, these are probably some of the big stories that especially we as journalists are going to have to keep an eye on and will be covering. MARTIN: That's Abderrahim Foukara. He is Al Jazeera's Washington, D.C., bureau chief. He was kind enough to join us in our studios in Washington, D.C., for this look back at the big international stories of 2016. Abderrahim, thank you so much for joining us once again as always - and looking forward to more conversations in the New Year. Thank you. FOUKARA: Happy New Year to you.

npr,"December 31, 2016","Barbershop: 2016 Is Almost Over, But Was It Really The Worst?"," 

      Michel Martin
    
 NPR's breaking news reporter Nate Rott, former political reporter Sam Sanders and senior business editor Marilyn Geewax talk about what happened in news during 2016. MICHEL MARTIN, BYLINE: Now it's time for the Barbershop. That's where we get a group of interesting folks together and ask what's in the news and what's on their minds. For our final Barbershop of 2016, we decided we wanted to talk about some of the biggest stories in the news in 2016, so we turn to our own folks for this. In for a shape-up today as Nate Rott. He covers breaking news all over the country from his base at NPR West. Hi, Nate. NATHAN ROTT, BYLINE: Hey. MARTIN: And here in Washington, D.C., is Sam Sanders, who was all over the country covering the 2016 elections. SAM SANDERS, BYLINE: Hey there. MARTIN: Hey. And also back with us - NPR senior business editor Marilyn Geewax. Marilyn, good to see you, too. Thank you for coming. MARILYN GEEWAX, BYLINE: Hi, Michel. I'm glad to be here. MARTIN: OK, so let's start with the big question - at least the big question on social media. Was 2016 the worst ever (laughter)? It's actually become its own meme on Twitter. People are posting pictures of things like burning dumpster fires and... SANDERS: (Laughter). MARTIN: ...You know - and of course the many celebrities who've passed away. And you know what? One of my favorite comic strips actually had this as a storyline. One of the characters actually said, I just want 2016 to be over, to which I was, like... SANDERS: Yeah. MARTIN: ...Really - ""Judge Parker"" - really? (LAUGHTER) MARTIN: So Sam, you wrote about this. So you know... SANDERS: I wrote about 1,100 words on this very question... MARTIN: Yeah. Tell me about this. SANDERS: ...Because I'm guilty of this, too. Like, for the last six months, I have been saying and tweeting, oh, my goodness - 2016 - this year is crazy. By some measures, it's not that bad. And Marilyn can speak to this. But I wanted to ask the question, why is everyone going online, saying that this year is the worst? MARTIN: Or maybe phrase it another way. Why is everyone online saying... SANDERS: Yes. ROTT: (Laughter). MARTIN: ...This is the worst year... SANDERS: Yeah. MARTIN: ...Ever. SANDERS: So I talked to... MARTIN: So what did - yeah, tell me what you found out. ROTT: I talked to a few smart thinkers, and I spoke with Nikki Usher at George Washington University, and she said we have experienced the kind of climax of what she calls ambient journalism. So when you consume media and social media and journalism on your smartphone, on your device, it's always on you. It's buzzing you. It's in your face, and you're constantly harassed by these negative headlines. And that makes things feel a lot worse than they really are. And on top of that, this was a year where there was no part of the culture that offered something else. Usually pop culture is full of happy stories that get away from politics. But this year, think about it. Your favorite pop star probably endorsed a candidate for president. The NFL was taken over by silent protest. The biggest film of this year, ""Captain America: Civil War,"" was all about the modern security state. You just couldn't escape this negativity. And I think that's a part of it. MARTIN: OK. Marilyn, what's your take on this? GEEWAX: I am just amazed at the impact that social media has had. When I think about where we were in December of 2008, that was bad. 2009, we had, like, 10 percent unemployment. Now it's 4.6. We've been having low fuel prices, cheaper food. Inflation has been under control. Mortgages have been really cheap for the most part. Home prices are rising. There are five-and-a-half million job openings right now. Corporate profits are up. The stock prices are up. Someday there will be a meme called, 2016 - the good old days, you know? (LAUGHTER) SANDERS: Are you sure about that? GEEWAX: You know, like, we're going to look back on this and... MARTIN: Well, here's a... GEEWAX: Say, wow... MARTIN: Well, here's the... GEEWAX: ...That was great. MARTIN: But here's the hard question. Is this part of it - is it the celebrity deaths in part, or is it the election... GEEWAX: I think... MARTIN: ...Which was so ugly. I mean... GEEWAX: Yeah. I - to me... MARTIN: Is it partly that? GEEWAX: You know, to me, it was just - the election - the whole energy of it was so negative - people tearing each other down, calling each other names. You know, just - gosh, it was really negative and nasty compared with - in 2008, there was more of a sense of, this actually is a bad year; we need to pull together and do the best we can. MARTIN: Interesting. Nate, what do you think? ROTT: You know, no, it wasn't the years - worst year ever. I mean we could all hope that it's the worst year ever because that means 2017, like - things are looking up, right? I tried taking a positive tact on this because I do think that, you know, you are what you eat, right? So, like, I think if we look at all this negative news, you consume all this negative news, I mean, yeah, the world looks pretty bleak and terrible. So I was trying to pick my brain earlier and think of things that were really good this year. And I think objectively, we can say it was a great year for sports. The Cubs won the World Series. They broke their curse. That was pretty exciting. LeBron James fulfilled his prophecy and brought a championship... MARTIN: Yay. SANDERS: Oh, OK. ROTT: ...to Cleveland. You don't sound so excited, Sam. SANDERS: I don't. (LAUGHTER) GEEWAX: I loved it, said... MARTIN: Sam, it's OK. GEEWAX: ...The Buckeye. SANDERS: (Laughter). MARTIN: That's all right. ROTT: I am a unhealthy Denver Broncos fan, and we won the Super Bowl, so that's really good. So I mean I think there were - everything's relative, right? I think for some people, it was, yeah, a really, really, really bad year. For some people, it wasn't so bad. And it's important to remember that. MARTIN: And for Trump supporters, it was a great year. SANDERS: It was a great year. MARTIN: I mean one of our guests - one of our earlier Barbershop guests earlier in the year was saying, look; now we get a chance to see our ideas in practice. But moving on from that, let's just - all right, you know, we were looking at a lot of the lists that were together by lots of news organizations about, like, the biggest stories of 2016. And it was interesting, Nate, going back to your point, about kind of where you stand depends on where you sit... ROTT: Right. MARTIN: ...Or what you focus on yourself. So let me just start with you on that. What's your take on the biggest and most important story in 2016? ROTT: Well, I mean it's hard to argue that the election wasn't the biggest story of 2016. I was trying to think of some stories that we're going to think about in, like, 10 years, right? We're going to look back and say, oh, 2016 - that happened. And I think a story that didn't get a ton of play, was kind of overwrought with all the other stuff during the election - but cannabis, marijuana - now 1 in 5 Americans live in a state where recreational pot is legal for adults. And people that I've talked to in the cannabis industry say it's a game changer. It's a turning point, a tipping point, whatever you want to call it there. And I do think that that is something that we are going to be talking about going forward. One other thing that I know is not sexy - I'm stepping out on a limb here. But public lands, land-use issues are near and dear to my heart, and they're a big thing out here in the West. And they don't usually get that much attention because they just really aren't that interesting. It's kind of boring and complicated. And people on the East Coast don't really understand it as much just because public lands aren't as big of an issue there, but they've been in the news a ton this year, and those are big things I think we need to talk about if you're looking at this urban-rural divide and what what's important to people in different parts of the country. MARTIN: Interesting idea. Marilyn, you want to jump in on this? What's your idea of the... GEEWAX: Yeah. MARTIN: What do you think is the biggest story of 2016? GEEWAX: You know, what was a big story seemed... MARTIN: And it could be something you covered. I mean don't be modest. GEEWAX: Well, it seemed small in a way, and yet it was a huge story. The Carrier plant where the people got laid off - it's a good example of why things - negative news gets amplified. And I named all those things that were great about the economy. Stocks are up and this and that. There are all these good things that happened. But when you watch that video that somebody made with the little handheld smartphone, you get this video of people being told their lives are being shattered. You're going to lose your job, and the way that guy did it was so cold. It was like, and we're going to move, and you're going to lose your job and blah, blah, blah. And these people - you could just hear this gasp of people saying, oh, my God. You know, your life is about to fall apart, and this guy's just rattling on. So that ability to take something that was a relatively small story but amplified across social media made people feel like 2016 was a lot worse than it was. I think that Carrier story really had an impact on the election and an impact on how we thought about trade deals, how it helped kill off the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal. Those - that story reverberated in interesting ways. MARTIN: Sam, what about you? SANDERS: Yeah, I mean I think the default for someone who covers politics like me would be to say the story of the year was the election or Donald Trump or Russia. But I want to peel back those top layers and argue that the real story of this year was America's changing consumption of news and media... MARTIN: Yeah. SANDERS: ...And how that is shaping everything that's going on right now. It definitely shaped this election. I mean think about it. We have seen this new economy where people are consuming the news not from an NPR website or a Washington Post website but from their social media feeds. They are feed first, social media first. We've seen the rise of fake news. We've seen the rise of fake interaction in spaces like Twitter with all these bots doing God knows what. And so we've seen people more plugged in and more free to access all this information. But all of this freedom seems to have made us more divided. And my question going forward for the next year is, like, what do we as journalists do to fix that problem? We have to ask ourselves every day, are we helping (laughter) 'cause, like, that needs to be fixed, and I'm not sure how. MARTIN: And that is not a bad question to ask. SANDERS: (Laughter) No. MARTIN: I mean if you start out every day saying, what can I do to be constructive... SANDERS: Yeah. MARTIN: That - that's - to me, that's not a bad way to start the day. SANDERS: It's not. MARTIN: So... SANDERS: I mean because we've spent this whole year with everyone kind of just yelling for a year. MARTIN: Well, that kind of leads really nicely into my last question for just resolutions of - New Year's resolutions - so corny, but we all do it. I mean we all make them. So I wanted to ask. SANDERS: Yeah. MARTIN: Do you have any? Do you want to start, Marilyn? GEEWAX: Wow, resolution - I want to just seriously continue to focus on context for things that - 'cause I think that's what's missing in this social media environment where people see things. Some bad thing happens, and it gets really blown out of context. You know, that we don't - we need to step back. We need to be able to, as journalists, as Americans, as citizens, as voters - to look a little bit, to calm down and look at the big picture. That's just my goal as a journalist - is to keep things in proportion and to keep things level-headed. MARTIN: Nate, what about you? ROTT: Disconnect - I want to disconnect more. I know it's a hard thing to do sometimes with our job, but I think the importance of just getting away from your Twitter feed and the whole just waterfall of information and news and this and that and just, yeah, hang out, take a deep breath, talk to somebody face-to-face - I think those are things that I'm going to try to do a lot more of in the next year. MARTIN: Sam, I'm giving you the last word. SANDERS: I've been preaching this for the last year or so on the Politics Podcast. I think people should talk politics more with people in their lives in a constructive way. But what I've been hearing since the election is listeners right now saying, who are all these people on this other side that voted for that person? Who are they? Where are they? And it's like, that's your cousin. That's the kid you went to high school with. That's the person that bags your groceries. You just haven't talked to them, and you don't know what they're seeing and thinking and feeling. And so I urge people to talk about politics more but to listen and to engage not to persuade or to win but to learn. And I think so much of what we've seen in the aftermath of this election is people not actually knowing what their neighbors are doing or what they're like or what they're thinking. And that should change. And we can do that by talking about things like politics constructively. MARTIN: Wow, OK - some good advice. I have a lot to think about. SANDERS: (Laughter). MARTIN: So thank you, all. Thank you, all. That is Sam Sanders. Nate Rott - he joined us from NPR West - here in Washington, D.C., Sam Sanders and Marilyn Geewax. Sam, Marilyn, Nate, thank you all so much for joining... SANDERS: Thank you. ROTT: Thank you. GEEWAX: Thank you. MARTIN: ...Us for our very last Barbershop of 2016. And happy New Year to everyone. SANDERS: Happy New Year. ROTT: Happy New Year. GEEWAX: Happy New Year to you all, too. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"December 31, 2016",South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott Reflects On A Tumultuous Year," And Senator Tim Scott joins us now from Charleston, S.C. Senator Scott, thank you so much for joining us, and congratulations on your re-election. TIM SCOTT: Thank you. Thank you. Happy New Year's Eve, and I hope you guys have a blessed 2017. MARTIN: And we do, too. Senator, it's been quite a year. You enjoyed the honor of re-election. You've given some memorable speeches that have gotten a lot of attention. You also endured the tragedy of losing your friend, State Senator Clementa Pinckney, who was killed along with eight others at Emanuel Church in 2015? And the trial of the killer, Dylann Roof, just concluded. So I wanted to start by asking you, what was the most consequential event of the past year for you? SCOTT: You know, it's hard to overlook the conviction of Dylann Roof as it relates to 33 counts. It's hard to not see that as a powerful statement against a person who wanted to start a race war by coming to Charleston and snuffing out the futures of nine amazing people, one of whom of course was Clementa Pinckney. He was a friend, an amazing pastor, a state senator who was a Democrat who did not operate from a partisan perspective but allowed the love of the Lord to fill his heart and shared it with everyone. And that's a real loss. But what a victory. For those of us - I'm sorry - those of us who were watching and paying attention and - on pins and needles, frankly, seeing the outcome of that was powerful. It doesn't make up for the loss of lives, but it certainly reinforces why in the epicenter of tragedy Charleston rose again to a height that was unfamiliar around the country frankly and one that we celebrate. MARTIN: Now, it's been, as we said, a year in which there have just been so many things. I mean we've been scouring the lists of a number of news organizations for their ideas about what were the most important sort of stories of the year, and two things seemed to leap out. One is the number of killings of black men by police, and the other is the killings of police officers. And in July, following a week of deadly shooting, you gave a deeply personal speech on the floor of the Senate. You described how you'd been pulled over by law enforcement as many as seven times in one year while serving in public office. I just want to play a short clip. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SCOTT: So while I thank God I have not endured bodily harm, I have, however, felt the pressure applied by the scales of justice when they are slanted. I have felt the anger, the frustration, the sadness and the humiliation that comes with feeling like you're being targeted for nothing more than being just yourself. MARTIN: Do you think you made a difference with that speech? SCOTT: You know, it's hard. It's hard to know. I hope that I have. Certainly in South Carolina, I think we have moved towards one another in many ways. I hope that this speech was a part of the spark. I hope it validated the experiences of so many men of color, and at the same time, I think it brought more attention to the issue. And frankly the response from many conservatives was a, oh, wow - almost seeing this with new eyes for the first time. So my hope is that we have that family conversation in a way that brings our country closer together and builds a bridge to the future. MARTIN: Well, it seems clear that you hope to be a bridge builder. And just even in the conversation we're having now, you've talked about the hope of and the desire for people to be able to have conversations and not be so caught up in division. But now we're coming out of an election that was extremely polarizing. I just have to ask. You know, how can I put this? There doesn't seem to be much of an appetite for the kind of dialogue that you have been espousing and also trying to model at least right now. SCOTT: Certainly. But you know, I think folks who saw this election as just a tragic outcome will be surprised, and hopefully their hearts will be uplifted as president-elect becomes president of the United States. I do, however, believe that with this new administration, we have an opportunity as a party to put up or shut up. Donald Trump said on the campaign trail, what do African-Americans have to lose? I think a better question is, what do we have to gain? And the answer will be crystal clear after four years or perhaps after just a couple of years. I'm optimistic, and I would ask those who believe in the power of reconciliation to be optimistic. MARTIN: You know, to that end, there's been a lot of talk about how Democrats should conduct themselves going forward in the Congress as the minority in both houses. Some are saying they should sign on to common sense policies that make sense for their constituents. But others are saying that they should follow the example of Senator Mitch McConnell when he was - as Republican leader who said famously that the goal of a caucus - the most important task was to defeat President Obama's efforts at re-election. And so the question would be, if the Democrats conduct themselves toward President Trump the way Republicans did toward President Obama, would that be fair? SCOTT: Well, certainly. As President Obama said, elections have consequences. And what he meant was very clear in his policies. And his policies led to frankly a Trump victory from my perspective. The answer to your question, however - should Democrats treat Republicans in the same fashion that Republicans treated Democrats? - I will tell you. In the Senate, the answer should be yes because when Mitch McConnell became the leader of the Senate, Democrats had more votes on their amendments in the first hundred days of Mitch McConnell's leadership than they had under two years of Harry Reid's leadership. So the question about how to treat the other side - if we're going to use the Republican Senate as a way of deciding yes or no, I say treat us as we treated you because when we came into power, we gave Democrats more opportunities, more input in the legislative process than I had in my first two years. We did that in the first hundred days. So there's many ways to spin that question. The goal, however, should be not Republicans versus Democrats, not Democrats versus Republicans, but what do we do on behalf of the American people? MARTIN: That's United States Senator Tim Scott, Republican of South Carolina. He was kind enough to speak to us from Charleston. Senator Scott, thank you so much for speaking with us once again. We've enjoyed our many conversations with you over the course of the year, and we hope they'll continue. Happy New Year to you. SCOTT: Yes, Ma'am. Happy New Year to you and your family.

npr,"December 31, 2016","Thanks To Russia, 2016 Isn't Really Going To End For Obama And Trump"," In the Washington of 2016, even when the policy can be bipartisan, the politics cannot. And in that sense, this year shows little sign of ending on Dec. 31. When President Obama moved to sanction Russia over its alleged interference in the U.S. election just concluded, some Republicans who had long called for similar or more severe measures could scarcely bring themselves to approve. House Speaker Paul Ryan called the Obama measures ""appropriate"" but also ""overdue"" and ""a prime example of this administration's ineffective foreign policy that has left America weaker in the eyes of the world."" Other GOP leaders sounded much the same theme. ""[We have] been urging President Obama for years to take strong action to deter Russia's worldwide aggression, including its cyber-hacking operations,"" wrote Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. ""Now with just a few weeks left in office, the president has suddenly decided that some stronger measures are indeed warranted."" Appearing on CNN, frequent Obama critic Trent Franks, R-Ariz., called for ""much tougher"" actions and said three times that Obama had ""finally found his tongue."" Meanwhile, at Mar-a-Lago and on Fox News, various spokesmen for President-elect Trump said Obama's real target was not the Russians at all but the man poised to take over the White House in less than three weeks. They spoke of Obama trying to ""tie Trump's hands"" or ""box him in,"" meaning the president-elect would be forced either to keep the sanctions or be at odds with Republicans who want to be tougher still on Moscow. Throughout 2016, Trump has repeatedly called not for sanctions but for closer ties with Russia, including cooperation in the fight against ISIS. Russia has battled ISIS in Syria on behalf of that country's embattled dictator, Bashar Assad, bombing the besieged rebel-held city of Aleppo that fell to Assad's forces this week. During the campaign, Trump even urged Russia to ""find"" missing emails from the private server of his opponent, Hillary Clinton. He has exchanged public encomiums with Russian President Vladimir Putin on several occasions and added his doubts about the current U.S. levels of support for NATO — Putin's longtime nemesis. There have also been suggestions that Trump's extensive business dealings with various Russians are the reason he refuses to release his tax returns. All those issues have been disquieting to some Republicans for many months. Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Lindsay Graham, R-S.C., prominent senior members of the Armed Services Committee, have accepted the assessment of 17 U.S. intelligence agencies regarding the role of Russia in the hacking of various Democratic committees last year. That includes the FBI and CIA consensus that the Russian goal was not just to discredit American democracy but to defeat Clinton and elect Trump. They say the great majority of their Senate colleagues agree with them, and McCain has slated an Armed Services hearing on cyberthreats for Jan. 5. But the politicizing of the Russian actions — the idea that they helped Trump win — has also made the issue difficult for Republican leaders. It has allowed Trump supporters to push back on the intelligence agencies and say the entire issue is designed to undermine Trump's legitimacy. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has so far resisted calls for a select committee to look into the Russian interference in the 2016 campaign. He has said it is enough for Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., to look into it as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Typically, Republican leaders and spokesmen say there is no evidence that the actual voting or tallying on Nov. 8 was compromised, and that is true. But it is also a red herring, as interference in those functions has not been alleged and is not the focus of the U.S. intelligence agencies' concern. For his part, Trump has shown little interest in delving into what happened. He has cast doubt on the U.S. intelligence reports to date and suggested ""no one really knows what happened."" He also has suggested that computers make it very difficult to know who is using them. This week, Trump said it was time to ""get on with our lives and do more important things."" However, at week's end he did agree to have an intelligence briefing on the subject next week. The president-elect has not wanted the daily intelligence briefings available to him in recent weeks, preferring that they be given to the men he has chosen as his vice president (Mike Pence) and national security adviser (Mike Flynn), with Trump taking them only occasionally. The irony of this controversy arising at the eleventh hour of the Obama presidency can scarcely be overstated, and it defines the dilemma facing both the outgoing president and the incoming party in control. Obama appears to have been reluctant to retaliate against the Russian hacking before the election for fear of seeming to interfere with the election himself. The Republicans, meanwhile, have for years called for greater confrontation with the Russians, with Obama usually resisting. Obama did join with NATO in punishing the Russians with economic sanctions over the annexation of Crimea. Those sanctions may have been painful, coming as they did alongside falling prices for oil — the commodity that keeps the Russian economy afloat. On other occasions, despite Russian provocations through surrogates in Syria and elsewhere, Obama did not make overt moves to force Russia's hand. That includes occasions when Russia was believed to be hacking critical computer systems in neighboring Ukraine, Estonia and Poland. But this week, following a chorus of confirmation from the U.S. intelligence community regarding the Russian role in computer hacking in the political campaign, Obama acted. He imposed a set of mostly diplomatic actions such as sanctioning some Russian officials, closing two diplomatic compounds and expelling 35 Russian diplomats. There may have been more damaging measures taken covertly, and some Russophobes in Washington held out hope for that. But the visible portion of the program scarcely amounted to major retribution. And Putin saw fit to diminish the Obama sanctions further by declining to respond. Although his government has steadfastly denied any interference in the U.S. election, Putin rejected his own foreign minister's recommended package of tit-for-tat responses. (He even sent an invitation for U.S. diplomats to send their children to a holiday party in Moscow.) That allowed Putin to appear for the moment to be ""the bigger man,"" even as he spurned Obama and kept up what has looked like a public bromance with Trump, who tweeted: ""Great move on delay (by V. Putin) - I always knew he was very smart!"" Great move on delay (by V. Putin) - I always knew he was very smart! At the moment it may seem that the overall Russia question amounts to the first crisis facing the Trump presidency. Whether forced by this campaign interference issue or not, Trump must grasp the nettle of a relationship Mitt Romney once called the greatest threat to U.S. security in the world. To be sure, Trump needs to dispel doubts about his ability to stand up to Putin, who has bullied and cajoled his way to center stage in recent world affairs. But Trump also seems determined to turn the page on past U.S. commitments, from free trade philosophy to funding of NATO and the United Nations. And if his Twitter account is any guide, Trump shows little concern about the conundrum others perceive to be facing him. Above all, Trump has shown himself determined to play by his own rules. A year ago, many were confident that would not work for him in the world of presidential politics. We are about to find out whether it works for him in the Oval Office.

npr,"December 30, 2016","Simon & Schuster Will Publish Book By Breitbart Editor, Despite Criticism"," The AP reported Friday that Simon &amp; Schuster planned to move forward with publication of a book by Milo Yiannopoulos, in spite of harsh criticism. The forthcoming book, called Dangerous, is said to be about free speech. Yiannopoulos, who writes for Breitbart News, became widely known over the summer after he was permanently banned from Twitter for ""participating in or inciting targeted abuse of individuals."" As NPR reported at the time, Yiannopoulos had launched a campaign against Ghostbusters actress Leslie Jones, calling on other users to help him harass her on Twitter. (Editor's note: The linked site contains offensive material.) ""People should be able to express diverse opinions and beliefs on Twitter,"" Twitter said in a statement emailed to NPR. ""But no one deserves to be subjected to targeted abuse online, and our rules prohibit inciting or engaging in the targeted abuse or harassment of others."" Several Simon &amp; Schuster authors expressed their outrage on Twitter at the news that they would be sharing a publisher with Yiannopoulos. The irony of all this is that @SimonKIDS and @simonteen — books for ""kids"" — have nobly amplified the very marginalized voices Milo mocks 🤔 In a post on his Facebook page, Yiannopoulos wrote: ""They said banning me from Twitter would finish me off. Just as I predicted, the opposite has happened. Every line of attack the forces of political correctness try on me fails pathetically. I'm more powerful, more influential, and more fabulous than ever before and this book is the moment Milo goes mainstream. Social justice warriors should be scared — very scared."" In a statement to the AP, Simon &amp; Schuster said Friday that it does not condone discrimination or hate speech and that readers should ""withhold judgment until they have had a chance to read the actual contents of the book.""

npr,"December 30, 2016",Intelligence Compounds Or Bucolic Resorts? Russian Estates May Be Both," Russia was ordered to vacate two compounds it owns in Maryland and New York, as part of the sanctions imposed Thursday by the White House to punish Russia for its meddling in last month's U.S. presidential election. ""They are compounds that the Russian government owns and that they use for multiple purposes .. .intelligence, but also recreational, as well,"" said a senior White House official in a call with press on Thursdsay. ""And under the Foreign Missions Act, we have the authority to restrict their access to these properties based on their pattern of behavior."" While the Obama administration is calling them compounds, the sites — one on Maryland's Eastern Shore, the other in Oyster Bay on Long Island — certainly look like resorts for sun-seeking diplomats. A 2007 Washington Life magazine profile showed then-Russian Ambassador Yuri Ushakov and his wife Svetlana strolling the 45-acre retreat in Centreville, Md.: ""Within a short walk from the main house are a swimming pool and cabana, tennis court and waterfront dock. While the 57-year old ambassador's wife likes the seclusion of the pool near the river, her husband, a fit 60-year old, prefers swatting balls on the tennis court, boating on the river or cycling around the grounds with his grandson in tow."" An Associated Press report from 1997 said that site's mansion had been converted into apartments, and there were a dozen cottages — enough to house 40 families. While the properties in Maryland and New York were used for recreation and relaxation, James Bamford, author of three books about the NSA, says the estates were almost certainly used for intelligence purposes as well. It's likely, Bamford says, that Russia installed antennas on the roof for microwave eavesdropping. This would allow Russia to pick up phone calls, emails, or anything else transmitted over microwave, which Bamford says is the same thing as a telephone wire — except that it's invisible. ""You need a ground location to pick them up, and it'd be a good place to pick them up."" 
                A fence surrounds an estate in the village of Upper Brookville in the town of Oyster Bay, N.Y., on Long Island. On Friday, the Obama administration closed this compound for Russian diplomats, in retaliation for spying and cyber-meddling in the U.S. presidential election.

 A fence surrounds an estate in the village of Upper Brookville in the town of Oyster Bay, N.Y., on Long Island. On Friday, the Obama administration closed this compound for Russian diplomats, in retaliation for spying and cyber-meddling in the U.S. presidential election. Was it an open secret that these compounds were being used for intelligence gathering? ""I think anybody that works in signal intelligence, which is what the NSA does, would assume this,"" said Bamford. ""It would be silly if [Russia] didn't put microwave reception facilities in these places. That's what you do. That's how you collect intelligence."" But to the residents of Centreville, the Russian vacationers were a part of the community — neighbors who mostly kept to themselves, but who also went crabbing, played tennis, and threw big parties on Labor Day. As Bonnie Delph, who works at the Acme grocery in Centreville told NPR's All Things Considered, ""They're just like anybody else. And most of them now can speak English; you don't even know that they are 'the Russians,' as we call them."" Though when it came to local custom of catching and steaming live crabs, Delph said the neighbors behind the tall hedges had a different method: The Russians would catch the crustaceans, kill them with a screwdriver, and then boil them. Delph said that when she moved to Centreville in 1979, during the Cold War, Air Force jets would fly over the town twice a day, a practice that she said went on for years. Only later did the town's residents understand that the jets were flying over the Russian property. She said she was shocked and saddened by Thursday's announcement that the Russians were being made to leave. ""They're just vacationers, and now they're all older people, like me. And they cause no trouble — you don't even know they're there."" But she predicts this won't be the end of the Russian presence in her town. ""Times change,"" she says. ""What goes around comes around, and I'm hoping that they get to come back."" Bamford, the NSA expert, agreed that this exodus may be a temporary one. The closing of the compounds is ""mostly a symbolic gesture,"" he said. ""They'll probably get it back on January 20 anyway.""

npr,"December 30, 2016",Britain's Leader Theresa May Reportedly Condemns John Kerry's Remarks On Israel," British media reports citing an anonymous spokesperson say that Prime Minister Theresa May is harshly criticizing outgoing Secretary of State John Kerry for his speech condemning Israeli settlements in the West Bank. In what seems to be a breach of etiquette in the ""special relationship"" between the U.S. and Britain, the spokesperson reportedly said that May believed it was not ""appropriate to attack the composition of the democratically elected government of an ally."" The Guardian reports that the U.S. State Department responded — also through an anonymous spokesperson: ""We are surprised by the UK Prime Minister's office statement given that Secretary Kerry's remarks—which covered the full range of threats to a two state solution, including terrorism, violence, incitement and settlements—were in-line with the UK's own longstanding policy and its vote at the United Nations last week."" Indeed, Britain was among the 14 countries last week who voted for a U.N. Security Council Resolution condemning construction of Israeli settlements in the West Bank (the U.S. abstained, allowing the resolution to pass). There have even been reports that the U.K. helped broker the deal, ensuring it addressed America's concerns. The spokesperson reportedly said May supports the UN resolution, but is concerned about John Kerry's language: ""We continue to believe that the construction of settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories is illegal, which is why we supported UN security council resolution 2334 last week. But we are also clear that the settlements are far from the only problem in this conflict. In particular, the people of Israel deserve to live free from the threat of terrorism, with which they have had to cope for too long.""

President-elect Donald Trump is unabashedly praising Russian President Vladimir Putin, a day after outgoing President Obama issued tough sanctions against the country in response to alleged cyberattacks intended to influence the U.S. elections. In a tweet Friday afternoon, Trump responded to Putin's decision not to expel U.S. diplomats from Russia in kind after Obama ordered 35 Russian diplomats to leave the country — admiring the Russian leader's strategic approach over President Obama, which is the theme of Trump's ongoing praise of Putin. Great move on delay (by V. Putin) - I always knew he was very smart! Earlier Friday, Putin instead signaled he would wait to decide how to move forward until Trump takes office, giving him someone in the Oval Office who has been much friendlier and quite generous with his praise — a stark break from decades of U.S. foreign policy. The Russian Embassy in the U.S. also retweeted Trump's post, which he pinned to his Twitter timeline so it would remain at the top. Trump also posted it to Instagram. On Thursday, President Obama issued a stinging rebuke to Russia after U.S. intelligence officials concluded the country had directed hacks into Democratic National Committee emails and the personal email account of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta.

 President-elect Donald Trump repeatedly praised Russian President Vladimir Putin during the campaign. Trump's praise of Putin stands in stark contrast not just with the outgoing administration, but with top leaders of his own party. GOP congressional leaders backed Obama's actions on Thursday, albeit criticizing the president for being too late in taking a strong stance against Russia. House Speaker Paul Ryan called the sanctions ""overdue"" but ""appropriate"" and said that ""Russia does not share America's interests."" ""The Russians are not our friends,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement, calling the sanctions a ""good initial step."" Obama has pointed to the impact of past sanctions by the U.S. and Europe in the wake of the annexation of Crimea, maintaining that his approach has damaged Russia's economy and isolated the country on the world stage. Trump released a brief statement Thursday evening in response to the latest actions by Obama against Russia simply stating that, ""It's time for our country to move on to bigger and better things."" He said he would meet with U.S. intelligence officials regarding the cyberhacking, though Trump has repeatedly cast doubt on their findings and throughout the campaign dismissed reports that Russia was behind the attacks. Trump raised eyebrows throughout the campaign with his praise of Putin. ""He's running his country, and at least he's a leader, unlike what we have in this country,"" Trump said in an interview with MSNBC in December 2015. He was pressed by host Joe Scarborough on the killings of political figures and journalists critical of Putin and deflected. That interview came just after Putin praised Trump as ""talented."" Later in the campaign, Trump suggested Russia should find emails missing from Hillary Clinton's time as secretary of state, which his aides later said was a joke. At the time, Trump tried distancing himself from Putin. ""I never met Putin. I don't know who Putin is. He said one nice thing about me. He said I'm a genius. I said, 'Thank you very much' to the newspaper, and that was the end of it,"" Trump said. But not long after, Trump was heavily criticized for saying Putin wasn't going into Ukraine, even though his country had already annexed Crimea. The Republican nominee also repeated his praise of Putin as ""a leader far more than our president has been"" at a national security town hall in early September. One of the most memorable clashes in Trump's debates with Hillary Clinton was when the Democratic nominee accused him of being a ""puppet"" of Russia. Trump shot back: ""No puppet. No puppet. You're the puppet."" He often criticizes the so-called ""reset"" with Russia that Clinton led in the early days of the Obama administration, even as Trump himself repeatedly has called for friendlier relations with Moscow. With three weeks until Inauguration Day, Trump has increasingly used his Twitter feed to weigh in on foreign policy — violating usual protocols where the winner of an election avoids interfering in the foreign policy actions of the sitting president. Trump's staff has said such use of Twitter to weigh in on foreign policy won't end once he's in the Oval Office. So far, he's outlined his opposition to the United States' abstention from the U.N. Security Council vote on Israeli settlements earlier this month. Trump has also criticized China for its seizure of an unmanned U.S. Navy underwater drone, before saying the country that he's often criticized should keep the drone. And Trump has also called for the U.S. to strengthen its nuclear arsenal and recently seemed to encourage a nuclear arms race with Russia — perhaps because he believes his strategic approach to Putin will work better than Obama's.

Democratic Gov.-elect Roy Cooper defeated incumbent Republican Pat McCrory in November in a tight race. After the election, the Republican controlled Legislature passed two laws to limit the governor's power, in what Democrats called a ""power grab."" The law put on hold Friday would, as we reported earlier this month, remove the State Board of Elections from the governor's control by reducing the number of members on the board from five — three of whom could be from the governor's party — to four members, evenly split between the parties. The Associated Press reports that law is now on hold: ""Wake County Superior Court Judge Don Stephens ruled Friday that the risk to free and fair elections justified stopping the law from taking effect this weekend until it could be reviewed more closely. Stephens plans to review the law Thursday."" The AP reports that Cooper filed the lawsuit earlier on Friday — and got the temporary reprieve just days before he is set to take office. Cooper's term begins on Sunday. Meanwhile, a second law, passed two weeks ago, also puts a check on the incoming governor's power. It would require Cooper's Cabinet secretaries to receive Senate confirmation, significantly reduce the number of administrative positions in the executive branch, strip the governor of his right to appoint trustees to the University of North Carolina and take away some of the governor's power to oversee schools in the state. Republicans still hold large majorities in both chambers of the state Legislature.

npr,"December 30, 2016",Study: New Administrations Spark Mass Departures Of Civil Servants," John de Figueiredo has been studying this question. He's a professor at Duke University. And he joins us now. Welcome to the program. JOHN DE FIGUEIREDO: Thank you very much, Ari. SHAPIRO: So do civil servants stay or leave when a new president comes in? DE FIGUEIREDO: It turns out there's a much higher percentage of civil servants who will leave, especially at the senior executive service level. The senior executive service is comprised of the top 7,000 people in the civil service. In the year after elections, they have high departure rates. But the departure rates are even higher when the mission of the agency is at odds with the incoming political administration. For example, if a Republican administration is emphasizing defense and not housing, there will be a really high number of senior executive service or SES departures from the housing and urban development and those in the Department of Defense more likely to stay. SHAPIRO: How high numbers are we talking about? DE FIGUEIREDO: Well, so we're talking in the - hundreds of people will end up leaving the senior executive service. But again, that's a lot when you think that there's only about 7,000 people in that bracket of the government. SHAPIRO: When you talk about the senior executive service, what kinds of jobs are we talking about here? DE FIGUEIREDO: I'll give you three examples - the director of counterintelligence at the Department of Homeland Security, the director of drinking and groundwater at the EPA and the assistant administrators for response and recovery at FEMA. These are people who you really want to make sure they understand their jobs and have lots of technical and deep expertise in these areas. SHAPIRO: It's funny. When you say those titles, I would've just assumed that those were political appointees who would turn over with every administration. DE FIGUEIREDO: No, (laughter) they're not. The huge number of the senior executive service are civil servants with 25, 30 years' experience who've been studying counterintelligence, drinking water and disaster recovery their entire lives. SHAPIRO: So if we look, for example, at the EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency, Donald Trump has nominated a leader for the EPA who has questioned climate science - seems safe to assume that many EPA employees believe in man-made climate change. Would we then expect that a number of those senior-level civil servants would leave? DE FIGUEIREDO: That's exactly what our paper would predict - is that the environment is not a policy priority for this incoming administration. Economic development is. Jobs creation is. The people who work at the EPA tend to be concerned about the environment. They tend to be concerned about groundwater. They tend to be concerned about drinking water, climate change, a whole set of issues related to the environment. And these are exactly the people who've spent years in the EPA studying these kinds of environmental issues with deep technical and scientific knowledge. And these people are also - in the senior executive service - they're the highest performers. So you lose both high performers, and you lose deep expertise. SHAPIRO: I could imagine - sticking with this example - environmental advocates saying those are exactly the people who should stay and fight against the shift in agenda. But your data shows that's just not what they've done historically. DE FIGUEIREDO: Well, you can imagine. If you are an employee at any organization and you've spent your life building expertise and you're being told now we already have different policy priorities, and we're going to do things differently, that your opinion and expertise is not as valued. And you can find outside employment most likely at a higher wage in the private sector. And these are the types of people who will end up departing. SHAPIRO: What is the effect of losing so many people who have so much institutional knowledge? DE FIGUEIREDO: If you think about government policy, government policies are basically a bundle of political priorities that are brought by new politicians and facts and technical expertise brought by civil servants. If we bring only political priorities and no expertise, then we end up getting policies which are not based in facts. If we bring only technical expertise, then we get policies which are not responsive to the electorate. So you need both. SHAPIRO: That's John de Figueiredo of Duke University. Thanks very much for your time. DE FIGUEIREDO: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF BOOM BIP SONG, ""ROADS MUST ROLL"" Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"December 30, 2016","Week In Politics: Israel, Russia And The Race For DNC Chair"," Good to see you. DAVID BROOKS, BYLINE: Good to see you. SIEGEL: And sitting in for E.J. Dionne in Charlottesville, Va., Jamelle Bouie, chief political correspondent for Slate magazine. Jamelle, it's good to have you with us. JAMELLE BOUIE: Thank you for having me. SIEGEL: Donald Trump tweeted about Vladimir Putin not expelling Americans. Today, his tweet says, (reading) great move on delay by V. Putin - I always knew he was very smart. David, Donald Trump isn't the only Putin fan in Washington, but he's sure at odds not just with President Obama but with many Republicans and Democrats in Congress. How do you see all this playing out? BROOKS: It's a sad day when Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin are taking the moral high ground against us. I actually think this bromance is headed for a big old crash. Right now, we - we're struck by their similarities. There's apparent mutual admiration for each other. But they're too macho, aggressive, expansionist, egomaniacal schoolyard bullies (laughter). And I think once the administration - the Trump administration - gets into office, the inevitable conflict between the U.S. and Russia which has been developing for years and years will continue. And the very things that make them like each other right now will make them extremely aggressive against each other in the future as it gets personal, as it gets macho. And it's going to be a little scary I think. SIEGEL: Jamelle, your take on Putin and Trump. BOUIE: No, I don't disagree with David. I mean it's worth saying that Trump would not be the first U.S. president to try to attempt to repair a relationship with Russia. George W. Bush attempted this during his presidency. Obama famously or infamously, depending on where you stand, tried to reset relations with Vladimir Putin in Russia. And so Trump seems to be carrying on in his footsteps. But the difference, of course - and David alluded to this - is, well, these previous presidents, when that did not work out, were able to adopt sort of a reasoned approach to how they're going to face Putin's Russia. Donald Trump does not seem to have that ability to react to a setback with - calmly, I'll say. And so that does leave this sort of worrying risk. How will Donald Trump react if Putin moves to do something that violates the terms of an agreement they had, if Putin does something that flies in the face of what Trump views as U.S. interests? How will he react to this? How will he respond? And will we see some kind of mutual escalation of tension due to the fact that, as David said, we have two men on both sides who are very macho and aggressive? SIEGEL: Well, David, what about the tension between Donald Trump and, say, Senator McCain or other people on Capitol Hill who are going to investigate the hacking? Is that collusion going to happen before the one between Trump and Putin? BROOKS: You know, all of this is - I think is going to be one of the tails of the Trump administration. I think Trump does - well, we'll see. I don't really know what the administration will be like. But in this - so far, he has - exists in the realm of discussion and online media. Senators exist a lot in that world but sometimes in the world of actual action. And I think senators like McCain and Lindsey Graham and a lot of the Democrats are very hawkish on Russia and are going to want to take some actual action against Russia. And whether the Trump administration will actually actively thwart them I think is unlikely. I think a lot of policymaking is likely to shift to the Hill, as Trump occupies a media world. SIEGEL: Jamelle, should Democrats push against Trump's pro-Putin positions and question the legitimacy of his presidency? BOUIE: Should they - can - if a... SIEGEL: Should they remind us all the time of the Russian hacking and say that somehow... BOUIE: Ah, yes. SIEGEL: ...That tainted his victory? BOUIE: Well, I think Democrats and, you know, frankly Republicans who are concerned by it as well should continue to talk about the Russian hacking and continue to search for evidence and do investigations because regardless of sort of where - how it ends up in terms partisan politics, it is just a very troubling thing that happened to American politics. I think that Democrats, on that same token, should continue to speak about how - you know, in my view at least - how troubling it is that Trump doesn't just seem to want to improve relationships with Vladimir Putin but seems to actively praise him as an example of a good leader - this despite the fact that in Putin's Russia, journalists are murdered. Political opponents are jailed and murdered - that Putin kind of reigns over an authoritarian state. And having a U.S. president praise a leader like that I think should be considered very worrisome and should be something the Democrats and, again, Republicans who care about this should point out again and again and again because it is, I think, not acceptable in terms of mainstream political discourse. SIEGEL: Well, it's not every week that we have a drama featuring a president and a president-elect making headlines over foreign policy differences. But this week, it actually happened twice over two different countries - Russia, as we've just been saying, but also Israel. Following the U.S. abstention on the U.N. resolution critical of Israeli settlements on the West Bank of the Jordan River, Secretary of State John Kerry made a speech about the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOHN KERRY: They have a choice. They can choose to live together in one state, or they can separate into two states. But here is a fundamental reality. If the choice is one state, Israel can either be Jewish or Democratic. It cannot be both. And it won't ever really be at peace. SIEGEL: David Brooks, Donald Trump's nominee for ambassador to Israel disparages the idea of a two-state solution as a territorial compromise with the Palestinians. Can you imagine Trump's administration just dropping Washington's support of that aim? BROOKS: Yeah, absolutely. I think American policy toward Israel has gone into sudden polarization. The Trump policy, as you said, is almost to encourage the settlements and to possibly drop the possibility of a two-state solution, which everybody has accepted until now. The Obama administration has gone off to the other end, which is to focus primarily on the settlements. Now, the settlements are an obstacle to peace, but they might be the sixth or seventh most important obstacle to peace, the primary one being the legitimate fear of an ISIS in the West Bank, the existence of Hamas, which is in Gaza, which doesn't recognize the state of Israel. And this week's actions by the president and by John Kerry to put the settlements first is just an attempt to distort what's happened in the Middle East over the last 30 years in order to put the onus of the blame on Israel, which I think is equally extreme. SIEGEL: Jamelle, it wasn't just Republicans who criticized Kerry and Obama for this. Chuck Schumer, soon to be the highest-ranking Senate Democrat, was critical, too. Is there really any political will in Washington to press for a two-state solution between Israelis and Palestinians? BOUIE: None that I perceive. And one thing that I think is worth noting here is how within the Democratic Party, politics in Israel have become more polarized. The left-wing, the Democratic Party - it does very much have a focus on the settlements and sees the treatment of Palestinians and the treatment of the Palestinian communities as a paramount issue here. And you know, given that the two-state solution status quo in Washington seems to be falling apart, I do think that within the Democratic Party, you may see more and more politicians begin to move towards this more left position in part because where the energy is in the Democratic Party is with the left. And if that left decides to make this one of their litmus-test issues, then I think politicians will begin to move accordingly. BROOKS: I agree with the analysis of the Democratic Party. I think to take this, quote, ""left position"" is to be at war with history. I mean Netanyahu did freeze the settlements, and the Palestinians still didn't come to the table. The settlements that are out in the further-flung settlements - it's - there's a relatively small number of people - 20,000 Jews among 2.7 million Arabs. It's clear those settlements will have to go when the two-state solution happens. But they are not the big thing preventing a peace settlement. To fixate them is - seems to be just myopic and bizarre. SIEGEL: You say when it happens as though it's inevitable. BROOKS: Sooner or later, there's going to be peace - maybe not in our lifetime but someday (laughter). SIEGEL: Now, there's a thought. (LAUGHTER) SIEGEL: David Brooks of The New York Times, Jamelle Bouie of Slate - thanks to both of you, and happy New Year. BROOKS: Same to you. BOUIE: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF ONRA SONG, ""MS.

npr,"December 30, 2016","U.S. Ethics Chief Was Behind Those Tweets About Trump, Records Show"," The controversy was two-fold: (1) The OGE doesn't typically air its positions publicly, advising White House transition teams behind the scenes. (2) Trump hadn't promised the total divestitures of business interests implied by the tweets. New records shared with NPR on Friday show that behind the curious tweets was the head of the OGE himself, Director Walter Shaub Jr. In two emails, dated Nov. 30, just several minutes apart, Shaub sent to OGE Chief of Staff Shelley Finlayson the nine tweets that took the Internet by storm that day. He then followed up with a link to a legal document referenced in one of the tweets and writes: ""Get all of these tweets posted as soon as humanly possible."" The emails were part of a 365-page document shared with NPR in response to disclosure requests under the Freedom of Information Act. OGE is generally tasked with overseeing ethics in the executive branch of the government, and so it's one of the agencies looking into Trump's wide-reaching business interests and the conflicts of interest they create for the president-elect as he takes over the reins of the country in January. As NPR's Jim Zarroli has reported: ""With his vast network of licensing deals, golf courses and commercial real estate, Trump and his family stand to profit from his presidency to an unprecedented degree. Virtually any decision Trump makes could affect part of his domestic or international business empire."" Several OGE officials did not respond to requests for comment on Friday. It's still unclear why — if Shaub's tweets were deliberate — they were temporarily deleted on the day they were posted. At the time, an OGE spokesman said the agency was enthused by Trump's indicated interest (on Twitter) in avoiding conflicts of interest. Despite the stylistic peculiarity of OGE's tweets, Shaub's position on Trump's conflicts of interest is not secret. He appears to be on a campaign to get Trump to divest, as shown by his lengthy letter released earlier this month. ""I think that there's a uniform consensus among everybody who does government ethics for a living ... that Donald Trump must divest — he's got to sell his holdings or use a blind trust or the equivalent, as every president has done for 40 years,"" says Norm Eisen, a fellow at the Brookings Institution. ""So I took the tweets as an expression of that common-sensical view,"" says Eisen, who has served as special counsel for ethics and government reform in the Obama White House. ""This is an undebatable position in our profession."" NPR had requested, under FOIA, that the agency share all emails related to the Twitter postings on Nov. 30 and related to Donald Trump. Only one exchange appeared to involve a member of the Trump team. On the day of the tweetstorm, Shaub emailed ""D. McGahn"" — presumably Donald McGahn, the former chief of the Federal Election Commission whom Trump picked to be White House counsel — to notify him of the press inquiries and the OGE's response. OGE redacted about 15 pages among a week's worth of emails, describing them as ""draft"" or ""internal notes"" or ""draft communications plan."" The vast majority of the disclosures were media inquiries from the month of November — but also troves of messages from members of the public received around the time of the tweets.

npr,"December 30, 2016",Deal Or Disrupt? Congressional Democrats Weigh 2017 Choices," Democrats may have lost the House and the Senate over the past eight years, but they always had one thing: President Barack Obama — and his veto pen — in the White House. That won't be the case next year, when Republicans find themselves with all the power in Washington for the first time since 2006. The capitol's new power dynamic — and the aggressive agenda Republican leaders are laying out for 2017— is forcing Democrats to make some tough strategic choices about how they'll work as a minority party. The starting point in the conversation Democrats are having with themselves right now is this: Republicans in Congress spent almost all of the past eight years opposing President Obama, and they seem to have reaped a lot of political rewards for the block opposition. GOP leaders will get to set the agenda in Congress next year. And among their first orders of business will be voting on a Supreme Court nominee picked by President Donald Trump. That's after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell rejected any hearings, let alone votes, for Obama's pick, Merrick Garland. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is quick and careful to reject an approach of wholesale opposition, though. She recently described Democrats' approach as ""always trying to find a place where we can find a common goal. Giving [Republicans] credit, or saving face, whatever it happens to be."" ""We would be hopeful that there are some places that we can work together,"" Pelosi said. But when Pelosi and other Democrats talk about working with Trump, that common goal is conditional. They say Trump would have to be willing to do things they care about — like, perhaps, following through on a promise to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on infrastructure projects. ""We think it should be large. He's mentioned a trillion dollars. I told him that sounds good to me,"" incoming Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer recently told ABC News. Highlighting differences But otherwise, Democrats are confident that drawing out their differences with the new president will be a winning strategy. ""Our big leverage is the public,"" Pelosi said, expressing confidence that public opinion sides with Democrats when it comes to issues like not making major changes to Medicare and Social Security. Democrats are eager to draw the contrast on those sorts of topics, and see those particular wedge issues as a big reason why they won back the House and Senate in 2006, the last time Republicans held so much power in Washington. That's why, while Republicans like McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan are focusing on repealing Obamacare, Pelosi, Schumer, and other Democrats keep talking about the possibility of wholesale Medicare changes. ""Republicans here in Washington are gearing up for a war on seniors,"" Schumer warned at a recent Washington press conference with a ""hands off our Medicare"" message. Schumer said Senate Democrats will give ""one heck of a hearing"" to Rep. Tom Price, Trump's pick for the Department of Health and Human Services and a longtime Medicare critic. Democrats think they can generate a lot of positive headlines by grilling Trump's cabinet picks. ""These are, with a few exceptions, radical nominees, the likes of which we have never seen in this country,"" said Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut. Democrats see hearings as a way to continue emphasizing their key concerns about Trump, like the fact he never released his tax returns, and the ongoing question of how he'll avoid conflict-of-interest problems as president. They see Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson's hearing as an avenue to highlight Russia's attempt to disrupt the presidential race, and Trump's warm words toward Russian President Vladimir Putin. A big choice on Obamacare But highlighting contrasts can only go so far, when Republicans set the Congressional agenda. At some point, Democrats still face a choice. Do they do their best to block every single big initiative, or try to work with Republicans to make it more Democrat-friendly? Sarah Binder studies Congress at the Brookings Institution, and said Democrats do have leverage. ""On most measures, whether it's spending bills, deregulation, repeal Dodd-Frank. That all requires cooperation from at least eight Democrats."" That's because while Republicans will control the Senate with 52 seats, they'll need at least 60 votes to advance bills in the chamber. The hardest political calculus could be Obamacare. Republicans can repeal the landmark law without any Democratic votes, using the budget reconciliation process that helped pass the initial law. But they'd need Democratic support in the Senate to pass a replacement plan, since the measure would be subject to filibuster. Blocking any sort of replacement plan, and then trying to lay the blame for disappearing health care coverage on Trump and Republicans, would be a bold, if callous, political move. ""Are they kind of, as a party, constitutionally adverse to that type of strategy? Many people think so,"" said Binder. ""That they just value government and legislative action too much to do that to the process."" Indeed, many Democrats might want to work with Republicans to keep as much of Obamacare as they can. But helping give Trump a big legislative accomplishment could make him more popular. And it could anger progressive activists. ""It is the responsibility of this minority of Democrats in Congress to block, obstruct, disrupt, and do whatever they can,"" filmmaker Michael Moore recently argued on CNN. He issued a warning to Democrats who may consider cutting deals with Trump: ""In the same way that the Tea Party was there in 2009, myself and thousands like me are going to be at those town halls in the district in the spring. And we will primary these Democrats if they don't do their job."" Warnings like that may be why leaders like Schumer are quick to qualify any talk about working with Trump on issues like infrastructure spending. ""When we oppose Trump on values, or if his presidency takes a dark, divisive turn, we're going to do it tooth-and-nail,"" he told ABC News. Pelosi knows Democrats all across the country are anxious. But she's urging patience as the party tries to make its case to voters. ""Somebody used the analogy of, it's like telling somebody they married the wrong person or their art is fake,"" she recently told reporters. The first scenario is something many people have seen happen to a friend or family member. The second? Maybe not as much. Still, Pelosi's point was that American voters did choose Trump and the GOP this year. ""They bought it. They'll find out sooner or later whether they made a mistake,"" she said, arguing that it's better to let the married couple or art connoisseur make that discovery themselves, than to be told by an outside party. Pelosi has seen voters reject Democrats, come back to the party, and then reject them again. She said she is patient enough to point out the key differences between the parties, and wait for voters to eventually come back.

npr,"December 30, 2016",Russian Hacking Allegations Will Follow Trump Into The White House," So maybe not the news we expected from Moscow this morning. After the Obama administration decided to expel 35 Russian diplomats and impose new sanctions over Russia's alleged meddling in the U.S. election, Vladimir Putin announced, well, that he hopes American diplomats in Moscow enjoy their holiday. He even invited their children to come enjoy the holiday at the Kremlin. This could be a peace offering to the person who will have President Obama's job in a matter of weeks, Donald Trump. And let's talk about this with NPR's Scott Detrow, who's been covering the Trump transition. He's in the studio. Scott, good morning. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Morning, David. GREENE: So Trump in the past has really downplayed the allegations about hacking against Russia, saying they were just a way to undermine his victories - he reacting to any of this? DETROW: Well, Trump has not said anything yet on Putin's latest move, though Trump has said over and over that he wants to have a better relationship with Russia. And last week, the Trump transition shared a letter that Vladimir Putin sent to him that was along the same lines. On the hacking itself, Trump did seem to back down just a little bit last night. He's no longer outright rejecting the intelligence committee's findings that Russia was behind this. He did say that he plans to meet with the heads of intelligence agencies about this next week. But Trump still isn't saying that - he isn't expressing the concern about this that other leaders have. Yesterday, he said that the country needs to, as he put it, move on to bigger and better things. GREENE: OK, so reacting to what's happening by saying the country needs to move on but saying he's open to listening to U.S. intelligence agencies - I mean that sounds pretty unpredictable here. DETROW: Yeah, and when it comes to how he deals with Russia, I think Trump is really in a tricky spot here. He may want to improve on the relationship with Russia. He may want to move on from the hacking episode. But a lot of Democrats especially are focusing on this hacking. They view it as a powerful political weapon. It's a way that they can paint Trump is illegitimate and a Putin puppet. And on the Republican side, remember; the Republicans have long pushed for tougher policies when it comes to Russia. Just look at the statements from House speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on the Obama sanctions yesterday. They approved of the sanctions, but they spent most of their time criticizing the Obama administration for not being tougher on Russia. So you've got that, and then you've got senators like John McCain and Lindsey Graham actively pushing for a whole new round of sanctions and more investigations into this hacking. GREENE: It's amazing. I mean we have - January 20, we have all this ceremony of a presidential inauguration, but we also have a really important international relationship that could really hinge on this change of power in the United States. DETROW: Yeah, and there are a few more key points to look for over the next few weeks that could create more tension. One thing is that meeting that Trump's going to have with intelligence agencies. Another is a broader report that President Obama has ordered to be released before he leaves office. So this could come out just before the inauguration, shedding more details on these alleged Russian activities. It will be interesting to see how Donald Trump reacts to that. And then two things in Congress - first of all, Democrats continue to push for a new special commission, something like the 9/11 commission, to investigate this. There's already a Senate investigation going on. They want a broader one. And lastly, given all this stuff with Russia, given the business ties that ExxonMobil has had with the country, you can expect this to come up over and over again in Rex Tillerson's secretary of state hearings. GREENE: OK, a lot to look forward to. NPR's Scott Detrow, thanks so much. DETROW: Thank you. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"December 30, 2016",U.S. Announces Sanctions Against Russia In Response To Cyberattacks," RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:  In fact, he invited American diplomats and their families over to the Kremlin for the holidays. We're talking throughout the morning about Putin's move and what it could mean for his relationship with the new American president, Donald Trump. But let's focus now on the actions taken yesterday by the Obama administration. GREENE: In addition to those 35 Russian diplomats being expelled, President Obama ordered two Russian compounds in the U.S. to be closed, and he sanctioned several Russian government agencies and officials, all this in response to hacking allegations that Russia denies. MARTIN: One of the strongest voices calling for these sanctions against Russia is that of Senator Amy Klobuchar. This week, the Democrat from Minnesota has been traveling with Republican Senators Lindsey Graham and John McCain throughout Eastern Europe. They've been meeting with key NATO allies, countries that Klobuchar says are very familiar with Russia's intimidation and aggression. AMY KLOBUCHAR: What you learn when you're here is that this isn't just about America. And if we just let them roll us and do nothing in response to an attack on our election system, an attempt to influence our elections which was held out by 17 of our intelligence agencies as true, and they're just going to be empowered to do it again. And maybe they'll do it in Germany, maybe they'll do it in France, that they're going to do it again and that's why the president's actions are important. MARTIN: What do you want to achieve with these sanctions? KLOBUCHAR: We want Russia to stop this attack on democracies across the world. They see this as a way to expand their influence, and it is illegal and it is wrong. And the only way we get to have this stopped is by putting truth to power. And by getting the information out there which is why we're calling for hearings in Congress, why we're trying to declassify information as much as possible so our own public will understand what's happening, and then why we will also be working on increased economic sanctions out of the Congress beyond what the president has announced. MARTIN: Sanctions don't always work, as you know, and the U.S. has employed them as a punitive measure against Cuba or North Korea. They didn't achieve what they were supposed to. Are you confident they will work now? KLOBUCHAR: It has to be a worldwide effort. They will work if we stand united with the European Union, we stand united with the Baltic states, and that we're just not off going alone. What they are hoping for... MARTIN: Do you need China's support? KLOBUCHAR: I think the impact of having all countries support it would be the best, but let's face it, having Europe and America stand together will make a difference. MARTIN: Donald Trump has tapped Rex Tillerson as his pick for secretary of state. He's someone with strong business ties in Russia and connections with Vladimir Putin. Could that be beneficial in trying to curb Russian aggression in the region? KLOBUCHAR: Well, I have a lot of concerns over the fact that the secretary of state nominee has praised Putin, has actually called for the lessening or elimination of sanctions, something that we think is really important for these Baltic countries and for America standing up against Russian aggression. So these are things that are going to be explored in these hearings at length. I find solace in the fact that there are some Republicans like Senator McCain and Senator Graham who are withholding judgment on the nominee because they want to get to the bottom of this. MARTIN: What kinds of conversations have you been having with Eastern European leaders? Because these sanctions are coming at this already tense time between the U.S. and Russia. Do the sanctions make life more difficult for them as they're on the Russian border? KLOBUCHAR: That's what's so incredible about these countries. And the sanctions are difficult for them, but yet they have been able to survive. And they believe so strongly in a united Europe and so strongly in NATO, that's their protection. They are too small of a country to go it alone, and they get that. They are concerned, yes, about some of the statements that have been made like Newt Gingrich saying that Estonia was nothing more than a suburb of St. Petersburg. Yeah, that concerned them. At the same time, they know that Congress has stood with them, that there's bipartisan support, and that's why we came together. They also believe Senator McCain when he has said that he has directly spoken to the president-elect, and that he has said that he will continue to support NATO. So our mission here is to stand tall with these countries, to answer their questions about what was a very volatile election in the U.S., and to tell them that we will have a smooth transition of power, and that there is strong bipartisan support in the Congress for going after the cyberattacks and for standing true to their independence. MARTIN: Is there a chance that this just exacerbates an already fraught relationship between two nuclear powers? KLOBUCHAR: You know, we have two choices here. We can just pretend this didn't happen to us, when the best intelligence agencies of the world has is telling us that it has happened, or we can decide to make the world know that we are willing to stand up against this kind of attack. This is the new-fangled way to undermine a country's democracy, and potentially look at how you undermine their economic system. And if we let this happen to us, it's going to start happening to other countries. And as you sit here on the frontline of these Baltic states like we are today, for us to just pretend it's not happening would be not just an insult to them, but really an insult to democracies the world over. And that's why I think it's so important that the president has taken these actions. MARTIN: Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat from Minnesota, thank you so much. KLOBUCHAR: All right, thank you.

npr,"December 30, 2016","In Pro-Brexit English City, A Jobs Crisis Is Averted — But For How Long?"," Voters in the English city of Sunderland did something extraordinary last June. They voted by 61.3 percent to leave the European Union, even though it put tens of thousands of local jobs at risk. Why would so many people vote against the economic interests of their hometown? The answer lies in factors that also figured in the American presidential race: opposition to immigration and a perceived threat to white identity. Sunderland's largest private employer is the Japanese carmaker Nissan. The company first came here in the mid-1980s, because the United Kingdom's membership in the EU allowed the firm to export cars to the European continent, tariff-free. Today, Nissan and its network of suppliers employ an estimated 30,000 people in the area. By voting for Brexit, residents were threatening Nissan's business plan. Predictably, Nissan responded with a threat of its own: no more investment unless the U.K. government offered protection from the damage that Brexit could inflict on its balance sheet. Fearful of losing a crucial employer, the U.K. pledged to help Nissan remain ""competitive,"" which most people took as a promise to protect it from any costs imposed by Brexit. Nissan then announced it would put two new models in the Sunderland plant. Meanwhile, the government has not, so far, disclosed any details to the public about whether that commitment includes financial support. So the crisis has been averted for now. But for many in Sunderland, this was a cautionary tale about how populist politics can put an economy at risk. ""It caused us sleepless nights, we were depressed for weeks,"" said Denise Walter, a committee member at the Philadelphia Cricket and Community Club, where some Nissan workers hang out. Sunderland is part of England's industrial heartland — the equivalent of Michigan or Ohio in the U.S. Like communities in those states, Sunderland has watched industrial jobs disappear over the decades, as the city's ship-building business moved to East Asia and its coal mines closed. Walter saw the Brexit vote as a self-inflicted wound Sunderland couldn't afford.

 Bailey Baker is a law student at the local university. He warned his father, Derek, against voting to leave the European Union for fear his dad could lose his job with an auto parts maker because of post-Brexit tariffs. ""Our local [council members] have worked very hard trying to bring initiatives like this to the northeast,"" she said, ""and this was just throwing everything away."" Among those who voted for Brexit were people who rely on Nissan for their livelihoods. Derek Baker works for one of Nissan's parts suppliers and voted out because he wanted the U.K. to tighten its borders and limit immigration. Baker declined to speak with NPR, but his son, Bailey, a law student at the University of Sunderland, shared an exchange they had on the issue. Bailey Baker warned his father that by voting for Brexit, he was putting his own job at risk. ""Nissan will never leave, they've invested so much into the plant already,"" his father replied. After Nissan threatened to halt further investment, ""He didn't speak for a couple of days,"" said Bailey Baker. ""I said, 'I told you so, Dad.'"" To appreciate what drove some of the Brexit vote here, it's helpful to visit the Humbledon and Plains Farm Working Men's Club, which offers pool, darts and cheap beer to a local blue-collar community. On Election Day, it also serves as a polling station. About 200 people voted here in last year's general elections, according to local officials. Turnout for June's Brexit referendum was nearly 40 percent higher. That caught the attention of Leslie Scott, a former city mayor who monitored the polls for the Brexit referendum. ""My lasting memory of this polling station was them coming in and saying virtually every time, 'What do we do?'"" Scott recalled. ""So, we were obviously experiencing people who'd never ever voted in their lives."" Scott also noticed voters proudly displaying patriotic symbols like the Union Jack, the flag of the United Kingdom, which some U.K. white nationalists have co-opted in the past. 
                Former Sunderland Mayor Leslie Scott voted to stay in the European Union. Among other things, he worried about the damage Brexit could do to the city's major private employer Nissan.

 Former Sunderland Mayor Leslie Scott voted to stay in the European Union. Among other things, he worried about the damage Brexit could do to the city's major private employer Nissan. ""We knew then that something was different about this election,"" Scott said, referring to the Brexit vote. One recent evening, a couple of dozen white-haired women descend on the club for country line dancing. They two-step and spin across the worn, parquet floor past a stage draped in American and Confederate flags. Tommy Wardropper, who is sitting in the bar, says he backed Brexit to keep foreigners out. ""We don't want more of them coming in, Muslims, immigrants. Closing our borders would be better for our country,"" says Wardropper, who works as a plumber. Wardropper followed the U.S. presidential race and is a big fan of the president-elect: ""I love Trump, because he's going to get rid of all the alien Muslims."" Wardropper is wearing a soccer jersey featuring a red cross on a white background. It's known as the St. George's Cross and serves as the flag for England, separate from the Union Jack. Wardropper is proud of his English heritage but says cherished symbols like this are increasingly under attack in multicultural Britain. ""We can't even put the George cross in our bedroom windows!"" Wardropper complains. That's not true. Even on the drive to the club, two English flags are visible outside nearby homes. When this is pointed out, Wardropper counters: ""Well, you can [show the flag], but it upsets the Muslims."" Dan Evans, one of Wardropper's drinking buddies, also voted for Brexit because he was tired of the United Kingdom having to follow EU law. Evans also complains that Muslims get special treatment on construction sites because of their faith. Evans spent two years building a paint factory inside the Nissan facility. Like Derek Baker, he gambled that Nissan was too heavily invested in Sunderland to shut its doors. And so far, that bet has paid off. Many here, though, wonder how long Nissan will remain committed to Sunderland and are concerned about the message the Brexit vote here sends. ""I worry about the attractiveness of any further foreign direct investment in a place like Sunderland if we are outside the European Union,"" says Brian Snowdon, who teaches economics at nearby Durham University Unlike most patrons at the working men's club, Nigel Lee voted to stay in the European Union. Lee says support for Brexit in this community was driven by one thing above all. ""The main reason up here voted to go out was racism,"" says Lee, a plain-spoken 72-year-old. For instance, Lee says, some people resent that a nearby Muslim community keeps to itself, but fail to recognize they do it in part for their own protection. ""The Irish have done it, the Jews have done it, they all live in separate enclaves,"" says Lee, nursing a whisky and lemonade. What's clear in this community is that many are determined to keep it white — and were willing to put the city's economy at risk to do so.

npr,"December 29, 2016",Trump And Company Prepare Inaugural Address In The Shadow Of Tradition," Brinkley emerged from the tete-a-tete at Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida to say Trump was not planning a stem-winder on Jan. 20. ""He doesn't want it to be long,"" Brinkley told CNN. ""He doesn't want people standing out in the cold."" In other words, Brinkley added, he doesn't want to be like William Henry Harrison, who in 1841 gave the longest inaugural speech ever (an hour and 45 minutes in a snowstorm) and served the shortest time in the White House, dying of pneumonia one month after the speech. That disaster aside, the inaugural address has become a major feature of a new presidency, thanks in large part to the mass media of the 20th century. But at the very beginning, the remarks were delivered not to an adoring throng of supporters but a gaggle of congressmen and other officials. Perhaps that is why George Washington did not feel required to inspire with his opening line at his first inauguration in 1789. To wit: ""Among the vicissitudes incident to life no event could have filled me with greater anxieties than that of which the notification was transmitted by your order, received on the 14th day of this month."" Some of that humility persisted four years later when Washington penned his second inaugural address. Just 135 words, it remains the shortest inaugural to this day. The inaugural addresses we often remember best were those delivered at the worst times in our national history. Most everyone has heard at least some of the speech Abraham Lincoln worked for weeks writing in 1861. With war between the states looming, the new president tried desperately to slow the spread of disunion. ""We are not enemies, but friends,"" Lincoln concluded. ""We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave, to every living heart and hearthstone, all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature."" Stirring words to be sure, but not successful. Secessionist forces would fire on the federal Fort Sumter in South Carolina the next month, and four years of civil war would follow.

 President Abraham Lincoln stands under cover at center of Capitol steps during his inauguration in Washington, D.C., on March 4, 1861. In the depths of the Great Depression in 1933, Franklin D. Roosevelt tried to translate his landslide election into new confidence for the nation as he intoned the words: ""The only thing we have to fear is fear itself."" Roosevelt went on to decry ""nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance."" And he added a note of hope: ""In every dark hour of our national life a leadership of frankness and of vigor has met with that understanding and support of the people themselves which is essential to victory."" FDR himself found a great deal of support, winning re-election three times. But the depression lingered through the decade and was only surmounted with the onset of World War II. No president has taken the oath in such dire circumstances since, but several inaugural addresses have been regarded as pivotal. According to Brinkley, Trump himself mentioned the speeches by John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan. Many were inspired by Kennedy's iconic performance in 1961. The youngest person ever elected president, Kennedy at 43 seemed to embody the spirit of his times with his address: ""Let the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and foe alike, that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans — born in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud of our ancient heritage ..."" Moving as those words were, they were eclipsed by the exhortation that came after: ""And so, my fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country."" A generation of his fellow Americans would do just that, in the military, in the Peace Corps, and in countless other forms of public service. Few may have realized at the time, but Kennedy's shining words were not entirely his own. Roosevelt and other presidents had depended on staff and advisers in composing their speeches. But with Kennedy there emerged the speechwriter as star in the person of Ted Sorensen. Sorensen had joined Kennedy's team in 1953, the year the future president entered the Senate. Sorensen had been raised and educated in Nebraska, but he had an immediate rapport with the scion of the Harvard-bred Kennedy clan. The self-effacing Midwesterner would have a hand in nearly all Kennedy's most famous utterances – including the book Profiles in Courage, for which the senator was awarded the Pulitzer Prize. Sorensen himself always downplayed his own role, denying authorship. In an interview with NPR's Scott Simon in 2009, at the age of 81, Sorensen had this to say: ""Let's just say that my work over an 11-year period with John F. Kennedy was a collaborative process, and I would not remember now who provided one word or one line. But John F. Kennedy was the author of his inaugural address because he's the man who made the decisions on what policies and values to enunciate."" Ronald Reagan was renowned for his speaking prowess long before he became president, although he too had speechwriters he relied upon — including longtime California politico Ken Khachigian. In his inaugural address in 1981, Reagan strove to put a postscript to the politics of FDR and JFK with this pithy judgment: ""In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem."" In Reagan's later years, one of his writers gained considerable profile in her own right. Peggy Noonan would also write major speeches for the first President Bush. Noonan went on to be a newspaper columnist, as did Michael Gerson, who gained a measure of fame writing for the second President Bush. Among Democratic presidents, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama were known for their way with words. Obama in particular rose to national prominence as a speechmaker. But both also had numerous writers with whom they worked. Which brings us to the present day and the case of President-elect Trump. Brinkley reported that Trump told him he'd started working on his address and planned to produce it himself. But his transition team has said he is also working with Stephen Miller, a former Senate staffer for Alabama Republican Jeff Sessions who has been on the Trump campaign staff for more than a year. At 31, Miller is a year younger than Sorensen was when Kennedy took the oath. Raised in Southern California, he came east to attend Duke University before coming to work for Sessions. Like Sorensen, Miller is very much a policy adviser as well as a wordsmith — motivated by the immigration issue in particular. Miller often spoke at Trump rallies during 2016, whipping up the crowd with harsh attacks on Hillary Clinton before Trump stepped on stage. He is also credited with drafting the acceptance speech Trump gave at the Republican Convention in July, a speech widely regarded as an indictment of life in the current U.S., a dark description of the nation's economic, social and cultural condition. But Miller is also said to have provided the prepared remarks Trump sometimes used on the stump in the fall — remarks that kept the candidate ""on message"" and minimized self-generated controversy in the campaign's final days. If Miller is indeed a major contributor to the Trump inaugural address, which Miller is likely to shine through? The crowd outside the West Front of the Capitol that day will be larger than any Trump rally to date, with tens of millions more watching around the world. And the Trump transition team has said the tone of the day will be uplift. Whatever the tone or the message, history tells us the first day of the Trump presidency will be remembered largely for the words the new president speaks.

npr,"December 29, 2016","Obama Expels 35 Diplomats, Imposes Retaliatory Sanctions Against Russia For Hacking"," The Obama administration hit back against Russia today. It says Russia hacked into politically sensitive networks to help Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election. For that, the U.S. is imposing new sanctions, expelling 35 Russians and closing two Russian compounds in the U.S. President Obama says all Americans should be alarmed by Russia's actions. President-elect Donald Trump responded. He said this. It's time for our country to move on to bigger and better things. Nevertheless, in the interest of our country and its great people, I will meet with leaders of the intelligence community next week in order to be updated on the facts of this situation. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:  NPR's Jackie Northam is following these developments and joins us now. Hey, Jackie. JACKIE NORTHAM, BYLINE: Hi, Ari. SHAPIRO: Give us more details about the Obama administration's actions today. NORTHAM: Well, you know, it's a sweeping response. Not only is the U.S. targeting true Russian intelligence services and several of its operatives, it's also going after companies that provide material support for those services. These measures are for alleged Russian interference in the presidential election - you know, hacking the Democratic National Committee emails, among others, and that. But beyond that, the administration says it's punishing Russia for stepping up harassment of U.S. diplomats in Russia. And that includes being physically assaulted and having diplomats' personal details divulged on Russian TV - that type of thing. And so the U.S. is also expelling three dozen Russias - Russians that it says are actually intelligence officials operating here in the U.S. SHAPIRO: Now, President Obama has said for some time that the U.S. will retaliate in some way against Russia. And he's said that some of that retaliation may be Republicans, some may not. Is there any evidence that the U.S. may plan to stage cyberattacks against Russia in response to the hacks? NORTHAM: Well, President Obama said in a statement that today's actions are not the sum total of the administration's response to Russia's actions and that the U.S. will continue to take a variety of measures at a time and place of its choosing. But Obama said some of that will not be publicized. So you run the risk of a tit for tat between the two nations. I just want to say, though, that U.S. officials said today that Russia has been engaged in a decades-long campaign of cyber-hacking and that there's no reason to believe it's going to change its ways. And, in fact, the Kremlin has already said that there would be appropriate retaliation for the sanctions. SHAPIRO: Of course, President Obama is on his way out. President-elect Trump - on his way in, who's been much friendlier-sounding to Russia. Could he reverse these measures? NORTHAM: These measures are part of an executive order by President Obama and can certainly be undone by when President-elect Trump takes office. But U.S. officials said that would present a direct threat to U.S. national security. SHAPIRO: NPR's Jackie Northam, thank you. NORTHAM: Thank you so much. Copyright © 2016 NPR.

npr,"December 29, 2016",Reflections Of Conservative Icon Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia," Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia once called the solicitor general's argument gobbledygook. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:  He deemed a majority opinion pure applesauce. SIEGEL: And he said he'd rather hide his head in a bag than support the court's 2015 ruling legalizing same-sex marriage. SHAPIRO: We're taking a moment to remember Antonin Scalia, one of the most influential people who died this year. SIEGEL: He was a conservative hero during his 29 years on the nation's highest court, notorious for his pointed writing from the bench. He was also known for his close friendship with fellow Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. They both enjoyed opera and rode an elephant together on a trip to India. SHAPIRO: All the more striking because their views of the Constitution could not have been more different. Here's Scalia and Ginsburg from an event last year moderated by NPR's Nina Totenberg. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE: You famously said in an interview with me that your - the Constitution that you abide by is dead. What did you mean by that? ANTONIN SCALIA: You know, I have to get a better word than dead. (LAUGHTER) SCALIA: What I meant by it is that it is enduring. And to my mind, no constitution is living unless it is enduring. If it is subject to whimsical change by five out of nine votes on the Supreme Court who decide that it ought to mean something different from what the people voted on when they - when they ratified the provision of the Constitution, that is not a living constitution. That is a dead constitution, one that does not endure. RUTH BADER GINSBURG: There's a - there's a certain... SCALIA: That's what I mean by it. GINSBURG: There's a certain problem with that view when you - where you said the people. SIEGEL: The people, Ginsburg argued, really only included one constituency back in 1787 - white property-owning men. That's evidence, she says, that the founders' ideas were meant to develop as society developed. Scalia was unmoved. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SCALIA: Nobody thought that the Constitution would morph. And to mean whatever five of the justices - in those days, there were only five justices on the Supreme Court - but whatever a majority of the Supreme Court thought it ought to mean to keep up-to-date? I mean, if that provision had been in the Constitution, due process of law shall mean whatever a majority of the Supreme Court from time to time shall deem it to mean, I mean, that provision... GINSBURG: I have to disagree that it's the Supreme Court because... SHAPIRO: The debate went on and on until... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SCALIA: We're not going to agree on this, Ruth. You realize that? (LAUGHTER) SHAPIRO: Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. He died in February at the age of 79.

npr,"December 29, 2016",Obama Announces Sanctions Against Russia In Response To Alleged Hacking," U.S. intelligence agencies maintain that Russian President Vladimir Putin personally authorized the hacking of Democratic officials' email accounts during the runup to the presidential election. Updated at 6:15 p.m. The White House has announced new actions targeting Russia in response to what U.S. officials say were cyberattacks intended to interfere with the U.S. election. In a statement Thursday, President Obama said, ""All Americans should be alarmed by Russia's actions,"" referring to hacks of the Democratic National Committee. Obama also cited an ""unacceptable level of harassment"" of American diplomats by Russian security services and police in Moscow. The immediate impact of the president's executive order is that 35 Russian diplomats will be expelled from the U.S. and two Russian compounds will be closed. The statement also names Russian individuals and entities — including two intelligence services — to be targeted by new sanctions. ""We will continue to take a variety of actions at a time and place of our choosing, some of which will not be publicized,"" the statement goes on to say. Later on Thursday, a separate joint statement from the Department of Homeland Security, Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and the FBI reiterated the claim that the Russian government was behind the cyber attacks: ""This activity by Russian intelligence services is part of a decade-long campaign of cyber-enabled operations directed at the U.S. Government and its citizens. These cyber operations have included spearphishing, campaigns targeting government organizations, critical infrastructure, think tanks, universities, political organizations, and corporations; theft of information from these organizations; and the recent public release of some of this stolen information. In other countries, Russian intelligence services have also undertaken damaging and disruptive cyber-attacks, including on critical infrastructure, in some cases masquerading as third parties or hiding behind false online personas designed to cause victim to misattribute the source of the attack."" President-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly cast doubt on assertions that Russia was responsible for hacks and leaks during the election. But shortly after 6:00 pm on Thursday, his transition team released the following statement, attributed to Trump: ""It's time for our country to move on to bigger and better things. Nevertheless, in the interest of our country and its great people, I will meet with leaders of the intelligence community next week in order to be updated on the facts of this situation."" Congressional leaders from both parties have released statements supporting the new sanctions, while taking thinly-veiled shots at political opponents. Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan sent out a short release to reporters this afternoon: ""Russia does not share America's interests. In fact, it has consistently sought to undermine them, sowing dangerous instability around the world. While today's action by the administration is overdue, it is an appropriate way to end eight years of failed policy with Russia. And it serves as a prime example of this administration's ineffective foreign policy that has left America weaker in the eyes of the world."" Democratic Senator Charles Schumer, who is expected to lead his caucus in the Senate come January, welcomed the administration's actions. ""I strongly support the steps the administration is taking to fight back against Russia's interference in our election. We need to punch back against Russia, and punch back hard. ""I hope the incoming Trump administration, which has been far too close to Russia throughout the campaign and transition, won't think for one second about weakening these new sanctions or our existing regime. Both parties ought to be united in standing up to Russian interference in our elections, to their cyberattacks, their illegal annexation of Crimea and other extra-legal interventions."" The Democratic National Committee, which was targeted by the alleged attacks, also weighed in, urging further action. ""We applaud President Obama for taking these actions in response to the Russian government-sponsored cyberattacks on the DNC, the Clinton campaign, and our free and fair elections. However, more must be done. ""It has been widely reported that U.S. intelligence officials have a 'high level of confidence' that Russian President Vladimir Putin was personally involved in these attacks, even providing direction on how the stolen material was leaked. These intrusions were not just 'hacks.' They were attacks on the United States by a foreign power and should be treated as such. Therefore, today's action alone by the White House is insufficient. Now it's time for President-elect Trump and the Republican leadership in Congress to put our national security before politics and show the American people that they are serious about protecting our democracy. That's why I have called on Congress to launch a thorough, independent, and bipartisan investigation on the Russian government's unprecedented interference in the 2016 election."" Meanwhile, the AP Reports that Russia is already considering retaliatory measures to the sanctions. And a tweet from Russia's embassy in the U.K. mocked President Obama, tweeting a picture of a lame duck. Russia has denied that it carried out cyber attacks meant to influence the U.S. election.

npr,"December 29, 2016",Obama Faces Difficult Choices Amid Stream Of Last-Minute Clemency Requests," Dealing with a flood of last-minute pardon requests amounted to one of the biggest surprises of his presidency, George W. Bush once wrote. Bush declared himself ""disgusted"" by how many people exploited their connections to make personal appeals. Now, President Obama faces the same set of difficult decisions on the way out the door, with many high-profile applicants requesting clemency in the president's final weeks in office. White House press secretary Josh Earnest recently warned applicants not to get their hopes up. ""He does not expect to essentially ram through any pardons at the last minute,"" Earnest said. ""There's an established process and the president believes that's a process that's worth following."" And yet, there's a long and checkered history for those last-minute clemencies. Bill Clinton's pardon of the fugitive money man Marc Rich launched a federal grand jury investigation. George H.W. Bush's pardon of Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger in the Iran-Contra scandal prompted a mini-scandal of its own. And Gerald Ford's pardon of his predecessor, Richard Nixon, may have helped cost Ford his job. But for defendants facing decades in prison, there's not much to lose by asking. One of those mounting a last-ditch bid for clemency is NSA leaker Edward Snowden. Snowden's living in Russia under a grant of asylum, but under indictment in Virginia. ""The question of whether I as a whistle blower should be pardoned is not for me to answer,"" Snowden said this year. ""But I will say this. I love my country, I love my family, and I have dedicated my life to both of them."" This month, Republicans and Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee united to condemn the Snowden leaks, which probably argues against his plea for mercy. On the other hand, there's the case of Chelsea Manning. Manning is the Army private who leaked a huge trove of military secrets to the website WikiLeaks. She has already served seven years behind bars, more time than anyone else, she argues, for disclosing documents in the public interest. ACLU lawyer Chase Strangio said her clemency petition is a matter of life or death. ""She absolutely will not survive her 35 year sentence,"" Strangio said. ""She is a transgender woman in a men's facility. She's already attempted suicide twice and been punished with solitary confinement."" Two other prominent clemency applicants include Bowe Bergdahl, who faces court-martial on charges that include desertion after going AWOL in Afghanistan, and former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, caught in a sweeping public corruption case that includes trying to sell Barack Obama's vacant seat in the U.S. Senate after he was elected president in 2008. And then, there are some cases tinged with history. Leonard Peltier is a Native American activist who has been in prison for 40 years, serving two consecutive life terms. In 1977, Peltier was convicted of killing two FBI agents on the Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota. His case has been championed by Amnesty International, Hollywood celebrities and human rights activists who believe he's innocent and got scapegoated by the government. But the FBI has opposed any mercy for Peltier. As Bill Clinton was leaving office 16 years ago, federal agents even marched to the White House in a show of force. One of them was Thomas O'Connor, now president of the FBI Agents Association, who said recently, ""We won't allow the Peltier legal and public relations teams to portray him for anything other than what he is, and that's an unremorseful, cold-blooded killer."" There's one more case from the history books. The adult children of Ethel Rosenberg, executed for spying on behalf of Russia in 1953, recently traveled to the White House gates with a special request. ""We're not asking for a pardon; we're asking for an exoneration,"" said her son Robert Meeropol, who was just 6 years old when his mother died. Meeropol told the NPR program Here &amp; Now that his mother's conviction was a perversion of justice. He pointed to documents liberated from archives in the U.S.and the former Soviet Union. Yet Meeropol said he has little hope President-elect Donald Trump will view the petition favorably. So this may be the last chance for his family.

npr,"December 29, 2016",10 Election Moments You Won't Totally Hate And Might Even Like," Elections aren't exactly cozy, even in the best of times. This one, though, felt worse for a lot of people. No matter where your allegiances lie, 2016 has been the emotional equivalent of a dumpster fire. But it wasn't all unbearable. Here and there, lighter moments emerged to provide comic relief — or even a small burst of joy. Here are 10 of them, in no particular order. When the balloons fell from the rafters on the final night of the Democratic National Convention, Hillary Clinton and her running mate Tim Kaine had a lot to feel triumphant about. The Democratic Party seemed to be uniting around Clinton as its candidate. But as the Philadelphia arena filled with red, white and blue globes, no one seemed to enjoy it quite as much as Bill Clinton, who looked up with childlike wonder. Back in November 2015, when Donald Trump was still in his campaign's relative infancy, he made an appearance on Saturday Night Live. The whole sketch was making fun of Drake's undeniably dorky dance moves in his video for the song ""Hotline Bling."" The SNL version had middle-aged dads and teachers dancing to the song and ""tax guys,"" which is the moment when Trump appears and even — sort of — sings a bit. ""You never call me on the cellphone,"" Trump says in a droll voice. He did not skimp on the old-man dance moves. It's a reminder that he is, at 70 years old, somebody's grandpa. Although this sketch was mostly making fun of Drake, it's also a reminder that sometimes politicians are at their best when they allow themselves to be the butt of the joke — something Trump hasn't done much of since. Clinton has said she's not a ""natural politician."" That might be partly why she can come off as cold to some people. But many who have known her in private describe her as warm and personal. That disconnect was problematic for Clinton as a candidate. But she leaned into the caricature in a winning appearance on Zach Galifianakis' Web comedy series Between Two Ferns. Galifianakis asked her intentionally ridiculous questions, like, ""How does President Obama like his coffee — like himself, weak?"" Clinton kept up with him, deadpanning like a pro. It brought to mind the Clinton persona created in the ""Texts With Hillary"" memes from a few years ago or the ""nasty woman"" memes from this year: a strong woman with no time for nonsense. At a March rally in Portland, Ore., Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders channeled his inner Snow White. In the middle of his speech, people in the crowd started to laugh and point: A bird had landed on the stage. While Sanders looked at the ground, it flew up and perched right on his lectern. The Vermont senator spent nearly 30 seconds just smiling at the little guy, making it quite possibly the most peaceful and unplanned campaign moment this year. Sanders might have taken it a little too far, though, when he proclaimed that the bird symbolized ""a dove asking us for world peace."" No, Bernie, it was just a cute little bird, and that's OK, too. Both President Obama and former President George W. Bush spoke at the Sept. 24 opening of the National Museum of African American History and Culture. Bush had signed the 2003 bill authorizing the museum. When President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama arrived onstage, the first lady greeted the former president warmly, with a little side hug that Bush sweetly leaned into. For many, the Bush and Obama families represent opposite ends of the political world, but this small moment showed that disagreement doesn't have to stifle common decency. My favorite little moment today: @FLOTUS greets former President George W. Bush at @NMAAHC Opening. https://t.co/CGcQubCL2z #APeoplesJourney For a brief moment, normal Midwestern decency stole the spotlight. For a brief moment. At the Oct. 9 presidential debate, a man in a red pullover asked a question about energy policy and won America's hearts. Maybe it was the sweater, or his mustache, or his earnestness. It certainly helped that his name was the made-for-the-Internet Ken Bone. Whatever the reason, Bone became an instant meme. ""How will you protect my job as a card in Guess Who?"" #debates pic.twitter.com/KZ3N1Xhq4O The Bone Zone, as he referred to himself, took advantage of his newfound fame and started to sell T-shirts and partnered with Uber to promote a new, local service. After a few days though, Reddit users got hold of Bone's real account when he used it for an AMA (Ask Me Anything). They unearthed controversial statements he made (and photos posted), including that the killing of Trayvon Martin was ""justified."" Even for a meme, it was a rapid ascent and fall. What the Internet giveth, the Internet taketh away. The hero we don't deserve, but need. #kenbone #debate pic.twitter.com/Ep1sQUcbtA Clinton played it safe with her choice of running mate: a scandal-free white dude with a lot of experience from a swing state. Maybe it was that background — combined with a Normcore sobriety and some pretty rad harmonica skills — that reminded a lot of people out there of a certain kind of dad we all recognize. Tim Kaine is the guy makes really full eye contact when he passes the peace at mass Tim Kaine wanted to make sure your sleepover was all right—oh, and he made nachos, he’ll just leave ‘em on the ping pong table Kaine will finish this speech then ask you to pull his finger and then play you some Wilco songs, Everyone's Dad for VP. President Obama and Joe Biden truly seem to have a close friendship, which isn't always the case between a president and vice president. When Biden's son had to leave his post as Delaware's attorney general because of cancer, and Biden worried he'd have to sell his house to support his son's family, Obama offered to help financially. When Obama turned 55, Biden tweeted happy birthday and called him ""a brother to me, a best friend forever."" As the two men leave office, people have imagined how their bromance (or BROTUS, if you will) is playing out during the transition. For many, it was much-needed comic relief during uncertain times. Biden: can i put whoopee cushions under all the chairs before he gets hereObama: joe im on the phoneBiden:*muttering* u didnt say not to pic.twitter.com/qfjh3ffkPE Biden: Hillary was saying they took the W's off the keyboards when Bush won!Obama: Joe put-Biden: I TOOK THE T'S, THEY CAN ONLY TYPE RUMP pic.twitter.com/D6Vh7Zu429 ""Please""""No, Joe the debate is on""""Just turn to ESPN real quick. I wanna see the score""""You have your own TV""""It's scary in my room."" pic.twitter.com/RAz6cv5Q7v Apparently Ted Cruz loves the movie Princess Bride. We mean, really loves. We know this because he re-enacted an entire scene from the movie during a November 2015 campaign stop at the New Hampshire television station WMUR. In a video from the event, Cruz is at the head of a conference table with a small group of people when he starts describing a scene from the movie. He starts out quietly, just explaining some of the lines. Then he launches into a full Billy Crystal impression, which is actually not half bad (Crystal makes a cameo as an apothecary in the movie). The people in the room are laughing — and maybe a little stunned — but he gets a round of applause at the end. The reckless abandon of the moment is pretty great. Jack Aiello's eighth-grade graduation speech will be remembered for all time by appreciative classmates, parents and people who just plain needed a break from a nasty campaign. He did it in the uncanny style of some of the 2016 candidates, and it's amazing. He nails Trump: ""Quite frankly we'll win so much you'll be sick of winning."" But it was his Bernie Sanders that really shined, especially when he calls for a ""cinnamon roll revolution,"" in which all cinnamon rolls will be free, apparently? Dream big, kid.

npr,"December 29, 2016",Ray Buckley Hopes To Lead Democrats As DNC Chairman," Mr. Buckley, welcome to the program. RAY BUCKLEY: Thank you for having me. MARTIN: We have been asking several Democrats this same question and I'm going to put it to you as well. There was an assumption in the election that there was this so-called blue wall that couldn't rupture, that somehow Democrats had built up so much support in the Rust Belt that Republicans could never break through. They did. What happened? BUCKLEY: I think that we fundamentally forgot how to campaign. And that's one thing that we in New Hampshire - New Hampshire's a very purple state, as they say, a 50-50, just about mirrors the country. But when the orders came on down that we were simply going to follow the analytics of some young folks that were going to tell us who our voters were, we said not so much, not here in New Hampshire. And we actually went out and did a persuasion program. So the voters that we were pulling out on Election Day were actually identified as supporters of Hillary Clinton and the rest of the Democratic ticket. We believe in human interaction, and that's the big difference between how we do things in New Hampshire and what happens across the country. MARTIN: You felt there wasn't enough just getting out and talking one on one with voters, things were happening too remotely from a tactical point of view? BUCKLEY: Well, absolutely. And if you don't have a human interaction, then the voters don't believe they're actually being listened to or heard. But if they've got a neighbor that's actually talking to them, either on the phone or at their door, then there's an understanding that the Democratic Party is actually listening to them and wants to hear their views. MARTIN: Was it just tactical errors or was there a flaw in the messaging? Because there have been a lot of critiques that the party just didn't offer the kind of clear economic message that working-class voters were looking for. BUCKLEY: Well, I really think it's - if you really do a deep dive, it's the real disconnect, that people did not believe that the party was listening to them. And I think that there's a difference when you're having a conversation with somebody and when somebody is simply putting a tag on your name in a voter file saying - oh, just tell this person - remind them to vote on Election Day. We believe that you actually should have a real interaction with a local person. We have a very strong ground game here that has existed now for a number of election cycles. MARTIN: So are you saying that there's no problem with the overall message of the Democratic Party, it just wasn't implemented well? BUCKLEY: I think that if people do not feel that they are being listened to or being respected, that it's very difficult to get your message across. I think obviously our message of hope and opportunity is one that the Democratic Party has always stood for. It needs to have been a lot clearer than it was in this last cycle. But I truly think that just like what happened in New Hampshire, that if it happened in the other states that there would have been a stronger connection to the voters, and the voters would have then, I think, responded in a better way. MARTIN: There is going to be a whole lot of pressure on the next DNC party chair. Why do you want the job? BUCKLEY: Well, I think that we have an opportunity to reshape how the party views things and how it's structured. The party's entirely too Washington-focused, and I want to flip that upside down. I understand that elections are won in the states and in the communities across the country, not within the Beltway. In fact, you know, I think that the Beltway folks actually do more hindrance than help when it comes to electing Democrats to office. And that's something that I brought to the position of state party chair. As head of the Democratic Association of State Chairs over the last eight years, you know, I have fought very hard to try to get a focus on the states. But unfortunately, with our leadership being entirely focused on Washington, it's not been successful. MARTIN: Ray Buckley, New Hampshire Democratic Party chair, thank you so much. BUCKLEY: Thank you. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

npr,"December 29, 2016",Obama Designates 2 New Monuments; Critics Want Trump To Undo It," DAVID GREENE, HOST:  And creating new national monuments - it's often controversial. Many Americans love the idea of protecting more land. But loggers, ranchers and others say this comes with a cost. Yesterday, President Obama created two new national monuments. One is just east of Las Vegas. It's called Gold Butte. And the other is Bears Ears in southeastern Utah. From member station KUER in Salt Lake City, here's Judy Fahys. JUDY FAHYS, BYLINE: In a statement yesterday, the president called cultural treasures the reason for creating the two monuments. Rock art, archaeological sites and land sacred to Native American tribes are included at both Bears Ears and Gold Butte. Obama said he wants to ensure that future generations are able to enjoy and appreciate these scenic and historic landscapes. REGINA LOPEZ-WHITESKUNK: There is so much to learn from the land. FAHYS: Regina Lopez-Whiteskunk is a Ute tribal leader who pressed the Obama administration to use the Antiquities Act to create the Bears Ears monument. She's been part of a coalition of tribes pushing for protection of the 1.3 million-acre site. LOPEZ-WHITESKUNK: There's so much that we yet to prepare our next seven generations for in being able to continue to live in unison with the land. FAHYS: Bears Ears will be the first national monument to be co-managed by the federal government and tribes. Conservation groups are also applauding the designation. Drilling and mining aren't allowed on national monuments. But many locals and elected officials in Utah are denouncing the move and vow to derail it. They say it will restrict how they use the land for ranching, for logging and other forms of economic development. Utah Republican Congressman Rob Bishop has proposed legislation that would have blocked Bears Ears and future monuments. ROB BISHOP: This is a political statement in a gotcha moment by a president as he's leaving the White House to try and pay back whomever he thinks are special interest groups that are supporting him. FAHYS: Opponents of Bears Ears have already spoken to the incoming Trump administration about reversing the monument designation, although past repeal attempts have failed. The 300,000-acre Gold Butte monument in Nevada could prove just as controversial. It's located along the border with Arizona, where federal agencies and locals have clashed before over land management. Opponents of these designations say they want Congress, not the president, to have the authority to name monuments. For NPR News, I'm Judy Fahys in Salt Lake City. Copyright © 2016 NPR.

npr,"December 28, 2016","Trump Reverses Obama Criticism, Touts New Jobs In Brief Remarks"," President-elect Donald Trump and @realDonaldTrump are contradicting each other. Wednesday afternoon, Trump emerged from his Mar-a-Lago resort to tell reporters that he and President Obama had spoken on the phone and had ""a very nice conversation."" ""I appreciate that he called me,"" Trump said. The comment came hours after Trump blasted Obama on Twitter. Doing my best to disregard the many inflammatory President O statements and roadblocks.Thought it was going to be a smooth transition - NOT! But asked by reporters Wednesday afternoon how that transition was going, Trump said, ""I think very, very smoothly. Very good. You don't think so?"" (A ""not"" was not forthcoming in real life.) The Obama tiff — or non-tiff, depending on which Trump you listen to — is the latest sign of a disparity between Trump's public statements and his social media statements. There's long been a serious personal rift between the two, but with Trump set to take the oath of office in less than a month, the stakes are higher. Presidents' words move markets and can create global tension. Take Trump's recent tweet about nuclear weapons, which quickly ricocheted around the world despite Trump aides' efforts to minimize the importance of the statement. On Wednesday Trump also highlighted a Japanese tech mogul's plans to create 8,000 new jobs in the U.S. Trump had previously appeared with Masayoshi Son at Trump Tower, to announce Son's promise to invest $50 billion in the U.S. and create 50,000 new jobs. Wednesday, Trump offered what appeared to be more specifics as part of that plan: 5,000 jobs that Sprint will bring back into the U.S. from overseas. Son's company, SoftBank, owns about 80 percent of Sprint. ""They're taking them from other countries. They're bringing them back to the United States,"" Trump said. In a statement on its website, Sprint said it ""anticipates these jobs will support a variety of functions across the organization, including its customer care and sales teams."" But the jobs aren't finalized yet — the company said it will ""begin discussions immediately with its business partners"" and aims to fill the positions by the end of the 2017 fiscal year. ""We are excited to work with President-Elect Trump and his Administration to do our part to drive economic growth and create jobs in the U.S.,"" Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure said in the statement. ""We believe it is critical for business and government to partner together to create more job opportunities in the U.S. and ensure prosperity for all Americans."" The additional 3,000 jobs come from a $1 billion SoftBank investment in OneWeb, a Virginia company that will set up a factory in Florida to manufacture satellites to provide broadband Internet access. Trump said the jobs are being created ""because of what's happening and the spirit and the hope"" around his election. He had previously taken credit for the Carrier Corp.'s keeping hundreds of jobs in Indiana — which came with tax concessions from the state where Trump's incoming vice president, Mike Pence, currently serves as governor. An earlier version of this story incorrectly identified the company named by Donald Trump as OneWorld. It is OneWeb.

npr,"December 28, 2016",Senators Ask Trump's EPA Pick To Disclose His Connections To Energy Industry," Democratic senators on the Environment and Public Works Committee say Donald Trump's choice to lead the Environmental Protection Agency should reveal his connections with energy insiders before his confirmation hearings get underway. In the letter dated Tuesday, the senators told Scott Pruitt, currently Oklahoma's attorney general, they were concerned about his close ties to energy lobbyists and wanted him to disclose lists of donors who contributed to a nonprofit organization that took funds from a network connected to the Koch brothers. Pruitt is an outspoken critic of climate change and has sued the Obama administration over the EPA's Clean Power Plan. The letter was signed by five Democrats plus independent Bernie Sanders. ""We have been troubled that as Attorney General of Oklahoma you used, nearly verbatim, industry talking points in official correspondence your office sent to EPA concerning EPA's estimation of methane pollution in your state,"" said the letter, signed by Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse, Ed Markey, Jeff Merkley, Cory Booker, Ben Cardin and Sanders. ""What that conduct says about your ability to lead EPA in a manner that is not beholden to special or secret interests is a subject we expect will receive a full airing during your confirmation hearing,"" the letter continued. The letter goes on to request details about meetings and emails related to the Rule of Law Defense Fund, which Pruitt help establish to collect large donations from big oil and gas companies including Devon Energy. Specifically the senators are seeking ""a written explanation of the role you or any other person under your supervision has played"" in the fund's founding and operation, a list of all expenditures greater than $1,000 made to the fund, and a list of meeting times, dates, locations, attendees and agenda items of its fundraisers. ""Before the Senate votes to confirm you to run EPA, it is important to provide a full disclosure of your relationship with the energy industry so we can determine how that will influence your ability to run the agency."" As NPR has reported, environmentalists are bracing for Pruitt's confirmation and are worried that he may try to curb much of the agency's power. Earlier this month the Trump transition team sent a 74-point questionnaire to employees at the Department of Energy asking for a list of employees and contractors who attended conferences on climate change. The department later said it was refusing to provide the names to the transition team. Read the full letter below: NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor ",http://www.npr.org/507276662
npr,"December 28, 2016",Trump Tweets Give A Glimpse Into Foreign Policy Approach," President-elect Donald Trump has used Twitter — his preferred means of communication — to weigh in on a swath of foreign policy issues over the past few weeks. His comments give a glimpse into how his incoming administration will deal with pressing foreign matters — but also highlight how reactionary comments on social media can immediately spur international concern and attention. And his staff has indicated that taking to Twitter to air his concerns or, often, grievances, won't end once he enters the Oval Office. On Wednesday, Trump blasted the U.S.'s abstention from the U.N. Security Council vote on Israeli settlements earlier this month. We cannot continue to let Israel be treated with such total disdain and disrespect. They used to have a great friend in the U.S., but....... not anymore. The beginning of the end was the horrible Iran deal, and now this (U.N.)! Stay strong Israel, January 20th is fast approaching!  The tweets came just hours before Secretary of State John Kerry gave a speech defending the decision and calling the continued building of settlements on Palestinian territory in the West Bank a threat to the two-state solution in the region. Trump's support for Israel and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — who has had a fraught relationship with President Obama — may be the biggest forthcoming shift in immediate foreign policy between the outgoing and incoming administrations. Throughout the campaign, he pledged that his administration would be a steadfast ally of Israel. President-elect Trump, thank you for your warm friendship and your clear-cut support for Israel! 🇮🇱🇺🇸@IvankaTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr https://t.co/lURPimG0wS To underscore that, Netanyahu replied to one of Trump's morning tweets, thanking him — and also his children Donald Jr. and Ivanka, who are close advisers — for their support. Ivanka converted to Judaism when she married her husband, Jared Kushner. An Israeli official told CNN the government will give the Trump administration ""detailed, sensitive information"" proving that the U.S. worked to push through the resolution. The Obama administration has denied those claims. Last week, after the U.S. decided not to veto the resolution, Trump also tweeted that ""things will be different"" come his inauguration, and then on Monday he again blasted the U.N. as ineffective. As to the U.N., things will be different after Jan. 20th. The United Nations has such great potential but right now it is just a club for people to get together, talk and have a good time. So sad! The Israeli settlement issue has been at the forefront in recent days, but last week Trump also weighed in on nuclear issues. In a tweet, Trump called for the U.S. to strengthen its nuclear arsenal. MSNBC's Morning Joe reported that the president-elect told them he wanted an ""arms race. We will outmatch them at every pass."" The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes As the Washington Post's Dan Zak told NPR's Robert Siegel on All Things Considered last Friday, Trump was inconsistent in his statements about nuclear weapons during the campaign. ""Trump said, you know, he'd be the last to use nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons are a horror. He seemed to understand what they're capable of doing,"" Zak said. ""At the same time, he said it was only a matter of time until countries like South Korea and Japan get nuclear weapons. He seemed to tacitly or not so tacitly endorse proliferation, again going against decades of international policy."" Trump also slammed China for its seizure of an unmanned U.S. Navy underwater drone, calling it ""unpresidented"" in a tweet before correcting the typo in a new tweet. China steals United States Navy research drone in international waters - rips it out of water and takes it to China in unprecedented act. After talks with the Pentagon, China agreed to return the drone, but then Trump later said the country should keep it. We should tell China that we don't want the drone they stole back.- let them keep it! It's not the first time Trump has stoked tensions with China. In a stark break with protocol, Trump spoke on the phone with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen earlier this month. Beijing considers Taiwan to be a renegade province and doesn't recognize it, and most other countries don't either. The U.S. has operated under a ""one China"" policy for more than four decades. Throughout the campaign, Trump blasted China for taking away U.S. jobs and claimed it was intentionally devaluing its currency to boost exports. He has blasted U.S. companies that manufacture goods in China, but as a New York Times story noted Wednesday morning, many of his daughter Ivanka's clothing and shoe lines are made in China; much of Trump's own apparel line is also made overseas, including in China.

npr,"December 28, 2016",Trump Expected To Deliver Economic Message," ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  Thanks, Donald. That's something that President-elect Donald Trump wrote about himself in a tweet late last night. Trump was pointing out that the consumer confidence index was at its highest level since 2003. He has been taking a lot of credit lately for an increasingly healthy economy, and today Trump spoke to reporters at his resort in Palm Beach, Fla., and took credit for thousands of new jobs being created by private companies. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: So we just had some very good news. Because of what's happening and the spirit and the hope, I was just called by the head people at Sprint, and they're going to be bringing 5,000 jobs back to the United States. They're taking them from other countries. They're bringing them back to the United States. SIEGEL: NPR's Scott Detrow has been following the transition, and he's here with more. Trump is saying these jobs are being created because businesses are feeling good about his election. What are the details here? SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Well, the details here are sparse at the moment, but Sprint put out a statement saying that these 5,000 jobs are coming from overseas. But it's important to point out that Sprint is just beginning discussions about where exactly these jobs will go. This is not a done deal as of yet. But the company's CEO putting - put out a statement saying, we're excited to work with President-elect Trump and his administration to do our part to drive economic growth and create jobs. Another 3,000 jobs are coming from the company OneWorld, which announced more than a week ago that it would be manufacturing satellites in Florida. The thing that ties these two together is SoftBank. It's a Japanese firm, and the head of that firm, Masayoshi Son, is someone who met with Trump in early December at Trump Tower to promise to bring 50,000 jobs to the U.S. So the theme here is that Donald Trump is acting like a mayor or a governor often does, connecting himself to one company or another, making deals for jobs. That's not something we've seen a president do. SIEGEL: Did reporters hear anything else from the president-elect? DETROW: Yeah, Trump took a couple quick questions. This was not a press conference, which he has not done for months. But Trump did say he had a conversation with President Obama, that it was a nice conversation today. That's notable because this morning, Trump tweeted - and I need to get the inflection right here - quote, ""doing my best to disregard the many inflammatory President O. statements and roadblocks, thought it was going to be a smooth transition - not"" - bringing back that '90s insults. SIEGEL: (Laughter) Could be a presidential first - doing that. On the economy, Trump has been taking a lot of credit for lots of good news in recent weeks. What's his argument? DETROW: Well, he's saying the economy is already responding to his presidency, and it's viewing it as good news. Trump pointed to the Consumer Confidence Index, which is at its highest levels in more than a decade. He's pointing to the stock market and the fact that it's surged over the last month even though it did drop about a hundred points today. You may remember on election night, as a Trump win because clearer and clearer, the stock market futures really tanked, but by the end of the week, stocks were up. And over the last month, they've been setting records day after day. And the Dow Jones has been approaching 20,000. SIEGEL: Well, does Trump have a point? Can he connect that good economic news to his victory and the - his impending presidency? DETROW: Well, it's true that these recent figures are really good, but these are long-term trends. This has been the case for months, and that's something that the Obama administration has been touting as well. They're very eager to make a contrast between the strong economic numbers of this transition and the really dire economic numbers from 2008 when Obama was preparing to take office in the middle of a terrible recession. SIEGEL: That's NPR's Scott Detrow covering the Trump transition. Thanks, Scott. DETROW: Thank you, Robert. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"December 28, 2016",Big Battles Over Farm And Food Policies May Be Brewing As Trump Era Begins," Many large-scale farms rely heavily on immigrant labor. And many farmers are opposed to Donald Trump's strong stance against illegal immigrant. At first glance, food policy seems to be an afterthought in the Trump administration. The campaign saw few debates about food or farming. And the president-elect hasn't yet nominated someone to head the Department of Agriculture or the Food and Drug Administration. But Donald Trump's lack of attention won't make future food battles any less cutthroat. Plenty of people in Washington, including powerful factions within the Republican majority in Congress, are hoping to change a wide variety of food-related policies, and believe that the new administration offers a prime opportunity to make those changes happen. Kip Tom, a farmer in Indiana who was a member of Trump's advisory committee on agricultural policy, recently told The Salt that this is a time to ""swing for the fences."" Parke Wilde, an expert on food policy at Tufts University, told us in an email that shortly after the election, he had predicted that food policies would escape radical changes simply because they enjoyed a lower profile. He has changed his mind since, because ""every news report seems to show that the incoming administration plans to pursue 100 fights simultaneously. I have never seen that approach work in American politics previously. But, in these wild times, who knows?"" Here is a list of potential changes to watch for. 1. Will the successful alliance of farmers and poverty advocates crumble? The Farm Bill, which funds both food stamps (now known as SNAP) and farm subsidies, is due to be renegotiated by the end of 2018. Some conservative Republicans probably will renew their efforts, previously unsuccessful, to scuttle the whole package, separating the farm-related provisions and the nutrition programs into separate bills. Many observers believe that this would leave each of them more vulnerable to attack. The political factions that have traditionally supported this bill, though, including farm groups and poverty advocates, are likely to mount a fierce counterattack. The stakes are high. SNAP, in particular, is one of the country's most important ""safety net"" programs for the poor. 2. School lunch reforms and nutrition standards may be under attack There could be attempts to roll back parts of the school lunch reforms ushered in during the Obama administration. Margo Wootan of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, who has been a key player in pushing for healthier food in schools, told us that ""given the deregulatory, anti-science rhetoric during the [Trump] campaign, we are on high alert."" She says Congress ""might try to rollback school meal standards or try to dismantle the National School Lunch Program"" by converting them into ""block grants"" that states could manage with only limited federal oversight. Wootan says other nutrition policies at risk include new menu labeling rules. Federal standards requiring chain restaurants to list calories on menus or menu boards are set to go into effect in 2017. Those rules were mandated by the Affordable Care Act. But Wootan says she's concerned that changes being considered by the incoming administration could ""weaken the provision of information to consumers."" And she says the Dietary Guidelines for Americans that were updated this year and serve as the basis for national nutrition programs ""could be part of anti-science efforts"" during the Trump administration. The guidelines are set to be updated again in 2020. 3. Will the administration compromise on farmworkers? Hostility to illegal immigration was central to Trump's campaign. But farm groups, many of them bedrock supporters of the Republican Party, are adamantly opposed to any wholesale deportation of immigrants who aren't in the country legally. Many large-scale dairy farmers, and growers of fruits and vegetables, rely heavily on immigrant labor. This promises to be a delicate backroom negotiation. 4. Environmental regulations. Which will go first? Among farmers, few regulations have inspired more hostility than the Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Water Rule. It laid out, among other things, a definition of which waterways should be subject to regulation under the Clean Water Act. Farmers were outraged to discover that some of their streams and ponds might be subject to federal regulation. It's likely that the EPA, under Scott Pruitt, will look for ways to withdraw or revise that rule. Other environmental regulations that are less well-known but probably more significant may also face scrutiny. Among them are the ""conservation compliance"" provisions of the Farm Bill. Under this law, farmers who plow up native grasslands or drain wetlands can lose their federal crop subsidies. The EPA also could reduce the number of large-scale animal feeding operations that it regulates as ""point sources"" of pollution. Environmental groups are concerned about what Trump's pick for EPA administrator will mean for the plight of bees. Bees are important to agriculture since so many crops rely on the pollination services they provide. And as we've reported, scientists are concerned that the widespread use of neonicotinoid (neonic) pesticides on crops such as corn and soybeans is linked to bee decline. Under the Obama administration, the EPA has been reviewing the safety of neonics. The Sierra Club is watching this issue closely. It pointed out in an email to its supporters that ""If Scott Pruitt is confirmed as EPA head ... it is clear he will severely weaken the EPA's power."" The Sierra Club email continues: ""the fate of bees — and all the crops and ecosystems that depend on them — may come down to a standoff between the Trump administration and science itself."" 5. Will political inertia trump Trump? Ferd Hoefner is one of the true veterans of Washington's food policy community. He has been part of these debates for almost four decades and has been policy director of the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition, which represents small farmers, for 28 years. And Hoefner, in contrast to every other policy advocate and lobbyist whom we contacted, believes that the Trump administration may choose to continue some pieces of Obama's legacy in food and farm policy. Take the environment, he says. Alongside the predictable push to dismantle some environmental regulations, Hoefner sees a good chance that the next Farm Bill might actually contain a new initiative that environmentalists will welcome. It will focus on ways to improve the fertility and microbial health of farmland soil. Soil health has always been central to the concerns of organic farmers. ""We have witnessed in the last several years a tremendous amount of interest in soil health from more conventional farms and organizations,"" Hoefner writes, in an email to The Salt. Hoefner also predicts that the Trump administration will end up supporting another piece of the Obama legacy, a controversial regulation issued in recent weeks, that protects farmers from abuse at the hands of meat packers and large-scale poultry producers. According to Hoefner, it makes little sense, politically, for Trump to dump a rule that benefits some of his strongest supporters, small farmers who raise cattle, hogs and poultry. With a pinch of skepticism and a dash of fun, The Salt covers food news from the farm to the plate and beyond.

npr,"December 28, 2016","John Kerry Defends Two-State Solution, Rebukes Israeli Settlements"," With his tenure as secretary of state rapidly pulling to a close, John Kerry made an impassioned defense for a two-state solution in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict on Wednesday. Kerry said he is concerned that some Israeli politicians are rejecting it. ""If the choice is one state, Israel can either be Jewish or democratic; it cannot be both, and it won't ever really be at peace,"" said Kerry. Speaking at the State Department, Kerry sharply criticized the Israeli government's construction of Jewish settlements in the West Bank. He said the policy was dimming the prospect of peace. In the more than hourlong address, Kerry also defended the U.S.'s refusal to block a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlements. The resolution led to fierce accusations that the Obama administration had turned against Israel. ""Friends need to tell each other the hard truths, and friendships require mutual respect,"" Kerry said. Kerry also shut down accusations that the U.S. had engineered the U.N. resolution — a claim by Israel's leader, Benjamin Netanyahu. In a speech shortly thereafter, the prime minister called Kerry's speech ""a great disappointment."" He warned that Kerry's vision could cause ""big, big damage"" to his country and said that his speech was ""almost as unbalanced"" as the United Nations resolution. Kerry spearheaded talks to reach a peace between Israelis and Palestinians not long after taking the helm of the State Department in 2013. As The New York Times notes in its write-up of the speech: ""With his presidential hopes dashed after his loss to George W. Bush in the 2004 election, Mr. Kerry saw his time as secretary of state as a chance to make a true change in the Middle East. In three weeks, his near-constant travels around the world will end and his energetic diplomacy will suddenly terminate. He has one major accomplishment under his belt — the Iran nuclear deal — but he could not achieve his goals on the Israeli-Palestinian dispute, or in the Syrian civil war."" As we've previously reported, peace talks fell apart. Earlier, President-Elect Trump took to Twitter to offer his view. ""We cannot continue to let Israel be treated with such total disdain and disrespect. They used to have a great friend in the U.S., but......."" he tweeted Wednesday morning. ""Not anymore. The beginning of the end was the horrible Iran deal, and now this (U.N.)! Stay strong Israel, January 20th is fast approaching!"" His choice for U.S. ambassador to Israel, David M. Friedman, has called the two-state solution an ""illusion.""

npr,"December 28, 2016","How The Donald Trump Cabinet Stacks Up, In 3 Charts"," Update: This post was updated on February 16, 2017, and will continue to be updated as other appointments are made. At a Thursday press conference, Donald Trump named one more person to his list of cabinet nominees: Alexander Acosta, dean of the Florida International University College of Law and former member of the National Labor Relations Board, is now nominated to head the Labor Department. He is taking the place of Andrew Puzder, who dropped out of the process this week in part due to questions about his past employment of person in the country illegally (including taxes paid in that instance) and personal life. NPR is tracking Trump's Cabinet as it grows, counting up the diversity and experience of his appointees, as well as a few specifics they might have in their resumes. So here's what Trump's Cabinet looks like by the numbers. Acosta's nomination means that 21 of 22 Cabinet-level positions (not counting the vice president) will have nominees — the CEA still doesn't have a nomination for its chairman. For the sake of apples-to-apples comparisons, we've compared all of those 22 posts across five presidents' initial Cabinets (for Trump we only count everything as a percentage of 21, as he has only chosen 21 people, and for Reagan and Clinton, we only count 21 appointees, as there was no Department of Homeland Security during their presidencies). Trump's Cabinet breaks with a trend toward diversity Of the 20 people he has chosen thus far, Trump's Cabinet has 15 white men. That's roughly in line with Ronald Reagan's initial Cabinet. However, it's also a swing away from a trend toward diversity over the last few presidents. President Obama's Cabinet in particular gained notice for its relative lack of white men. To draw a line between white and nonwhite, we used Census Bureau race and ethnicity categories, though unlike the census, we counted all Hispanics as nonwhite (the Census Bureau counts Hispanic as an ethnicity and not a race, meaning a person can be white and Hispanic). Alexander Acosta is the first Latino appointee to the Trump cabinet. The Census Bureau's system undersells diversity in some ways, though. For example, Obama Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, George W. Bush Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, and Clinton HHS Secretary Donna Shalala are all Arab-American. In the census, that counts as white, though some Arab-Americans disagree (and the Census Bureau itself is considering adding that category). Furthermore, it's not that the trend toward diversity has been as steady as the above chart seems to show; after all, these are just the presidents' first Cabinets. President Obama took some criticism for a less diverse circle of advisers in his second term. Diversity can mean bringing different perspectives to the administration. Of course, white men can be empathetic and open-minded, as National Urban League head Marc Morial recently told PBS NewsHour, but many Americans also look to the Cabinet as a sign of whether they are well-represented. ""The question is, do people feel their voices are heard? That's really important, that communities feel someone is at the table with my point of view,"" he said. Trump has chosen the outsider Cabinet Of course, there are other types of diversity — geographic, socioeconomic and experience, for example. And while Trump's team has been criticized for its economic profile (i.e., it includes multiple billionaires), it does break with usual Cabinet norms by being relatively light on established government figures. We've attempted to quantify this by classifying each Cabinet member by his or her most prominent jobs prior to joining the Cabinet (for example, Colin Powell had spent much of his working life in the military before joining George W. Bush's Cabinet). This required more than a few judgment calls — Glenn Hubbard (George W. Bush's CEA chair) had spent two years at the Treasury, but we decided he was primarily an academic, as he spent many more years in that field. Some of these are arguable: Was Hillary Clinton's career more prominently in ""government"" — that is, her time as senator — or as a first lady (which we'd classify as ""other,"" a category that includes people who are in politics but are not officeholders, like Reince Priebus)? We made her one of the few listed as more than one, as she straddles the line between the two worlds. Here we can see not only whose Cabinets were particularly heavy with people from the public sector (Obama) or the business world (Reagan, Trump), but also where different presidents have broken with tradition. Trump, like most of the last five presidents, will have someone from the business world heading the Small Business Administration. However, he will be the only president out of these to have a defense secretary (Mattis) with a chiefly military background. True, Donald Rumsfeld had been in the military, but afterward he made a career of working in government, while Mattis remained in the military through retirement. For a more holistic count of these Cabinet secretaries' careers, here is a breakdown of four different distinctions that Cabinet secretaries commonly hold. We counted up the initial Cabinet members who have had any experience in the military or government (at any level, from city to federal), as well as those who have served as CEOs or have earned Ph.D.'s. (This means these numbers will differ from those in the above table. Someone known best for government service may also have served in the military or have a Ph.D. or have been a CEO, for example — or even all four.) Once again, there were some judgment calls — does serving as the ""CEO"" of Chicago Public Schools — as Obama Education Secretary Arne Duncan did — really count as being a CEO? (We decided no; we're trying to count a type of business experience here, and public schools are a government entity. A similar but tougher call went into deciding that Timothy Geithner's time as New York Fed CEO didn't count either.) One other judgment call: we drew the line at Ph.D.s and excluded professional degrees, meaning that someone like Ben Carson, who of course studied extensively to be a neurosurgeon, would not be counted. There is also some debate about whether someone holding a law degree (a J.D., or juris doctor) should be considered a ""doctor."" For simplicity's sake, we decided to draw our border at Ph.D. This is not meant to imply that these are the only four ways someone might be qualified to serve as a Cabinet secretary. Rather, these are four ways of measuring what type of a Cabinet a president has. A Cabinet that's relatively heavy with academics (Obama, Clinton) might work and think differently than does a Cabinet with more CEOs (Trump, George W. Bush).

npr,"December 28, 2016",Beyond Fake News: 2016's Most Disruptive Media Moments," Here's the biggest understatement of the year: 2016 was the most disruptive moment the mainstream American news media have faced in a very long time. That's not because so many media outlets misread the presidential election, although that is part of it. And it's not just because so-called ""fake news"" has become a genuine issue, prompting Facebook and other social media outlets to address fraudulent items formatted to look like legitimate news reports — a long-needed change. It's because a number of disturbing trends eating away at the effectiveness of modern news media came to a head in this year's election. And — in a response that seems strikingly similar to how news outlets struggled with early disruption from the Internet — mainstream news outlets still don't appear to be responding very effectively. This year, there's a single moment with many implications. The election of Donald Trump as president is my top media moment in 2016, of course. Eric Deggans Each year, I pull together a list of moments that most affected media over the previous 12 months, looking at events like the rise of viral videos capturing police shootings or the staggering fall of NBC News anchor Brian Williams. This year, there's a single moment with many implications. The election of Donald Trump as president is my top media moment in 2016, of course. And the list of reasons why his campaign and victory matters for media also highlights the challenges at the very core of how journalism operates in America. Issue #1: Trust. This was a year in which tough reporting by mainstream news outlets often seemed to have limited impact on the opinions of voters. And I don't think it's a coincidence that's it's also the year in which mainstream news outlets had their worst polling on trust in modern history. Gallup revealed in September that trust in news media had sunk to its lowest levels in their history of polling on this question. Just 32 percent of those polled said they had a great deal or a fair amount of trust in the news media ""to report the news accurately and fairly."" That's down from 40 percent last year, 50 percent in 2005 and 72 percent in 1976, when investigative journalism was still on a pedestal following the Watergate scandal. Bad as those numbers are, they are worse among those who identify as Republicans. The September Gallup report found just 14 percent of Republicans polled expressed trust in media, down from 32 percent last year. ""This is easily the lowest confidence among Republicans in 20 years,"" the report said. This polling ties into an analysis the Pew Research Center presented in 2014, which suggests people who identify as consistent conservatives consume news differently from those who say they're consistent liberals. Consistent conservatives tended to cluster news consumption around one news source they trusted, with 47 percent of those polled citing Fox News Channel as their main source of news for government and politics. Consistent liberals were more likely to get their news from an array of trusted sources, including CNN (15 percent), The New York Times (10 percent) and NPR (13 percent). Small wonder that political conservatives have built an alternative media structure focused on news and information which speaks more directly to the priorities, values and fears of their group. That structure includes TV outlets like Fox News, online outlets like Breitbart.com, Alex Jones' Infowars and The Daily Caller, radio hosts like Rush Limbaugh and Hugh Hewitt and authors like Ann Coulter. Liberal-friendly media outlets such as MSNBC and The Huffington Post also speak to liberal values, but I believe the news consumption patterns cited by Pew show that those audiences also consume news sources outside that circle regularly. This means, as mainstream news outlets tried to break tough stories on Trump and Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton, they faced a news audience that included a significant number of people who distrusted their reporting. Some were consuming news on platforms that elevated that mistrust. I think it's telling that the stories that seemed to hurt Trump the most during the campaign were stories largely based on an unfiltered presentation of what he said.  Eric Deggans I think it's telling that the stories that seemed to hurt Trump the most during the campaign were stories largely based on an unfiltered presentation of what he said. In particular, video leaked from an old Access Hollywood tape featuring Trump talking crudely off camera about making sexual advances toward women, made a tremendous impact, in part, because it was his words presented to the audience without much analysis required. Issue #2: Bias and Credibility. Critics have accused some mainstream media outlets of political bias favoring liberals, but I think the biases which most affect mainstream journalism are different. They include a bias toward being the first to report a story, particularly if it has a big public impact; a bias toward ratings and revenue; a bias toward celebrity, conflict and scandal. Any of these biases can cause big problems if left unchecked. The attraction to conflict and desire to reach a divided audience brought some head-scratching decisions. CNN's decision to hire Trump's former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, even when it wasn't clear if he was still on the candidate's payroll or significantly involved with his campaign, was disappointing. The frequency of political arguments between partisans filling up time which could have been used for reporting on policy issues, particularly on cable TV, was also a mistake. Emails released by Wikileaks showing that Democratic party official Donna Brazile may have funneled advance information about questions from CNN's events to Clinton's campaign, showed the dangers inherent in hiring people who are active players in the election. What has hurt mainstream media particularly is a mistrust that it can provide honest brokers — people who, even if they are political pundits expressing opinions, can be fair to all sides of an argument. In an environment where so much trust is already gone, moves by mainstream outlets that chip away at their status as honest brokers seem unwise. But because interest in the election has also fueled a rise in news consumption — cable news channels in particular saw huge double-digit ratings increases from last year — news outlets haven't yet paid a significant price economically for any missteps. Issue #3: Normalizing racism and sexism. Given that Trump's electoral success has emboldened some white nationalists and racists who endorsed him, news media outlets face the challenging task of reporting on these issues and groups without inadvertently helping them recruit more followers or make their racist views seem more acceptable. NPR faced that challenge when interviewing Breitbart senior editor-at-large Joel Pollak about questions that the site has been a platform for the racist ""alt right"" movement. Pollak called the reporting and commentary on race and culture by our Code Switch team ""racist"" while also pushing back against questions about a Breitbart piece on the Confederate flag that denied the Confederacy was attempting to ""enforce slavery."" Host Steve Inskeep did a great job asking fair questions of Pollak, but the issues at hand are so complex, as a listener I was thirsty for a longer, more detailed dialogue that more deeply probed these allegations. NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik delivered a story that offered that level of reporting and probing, which is very difficult to capture in a single interview. Issue #4: Democratization of news through social media. The wonderful thing about social media outlets like Facebook and Twitter is that they can level the playing field and reduce the power of media gatekeepers. Anyone with an insightful observation or information about a newsworthy issue can reach the world directly. But that democratization creates an environment that can also allow fake news to spread. Beyond that, this leveled playing field can also reduce the value of the experience and expertise of reporters, make opinions and facts look like the same thing and make ideologically skewed reports look equal to more objective reporting. Facebook's development of a system to identify fake news is promising. But the fact that mainstream news organizations even have to deal with this remains disturbing.

npr,"December 28, 2016",11 Times Donald Trump Looked Like He Was Done For," Some politicians seem to have nine lives, constantly evading scandal and overcoming the odds. But this past year, now-President-elect Donald Trump may have had more than that. Many things he did would have been the death knell for any other candidate's political hopes — mocking a disabled reporter, bragging about groping, disparaging a Gold Star family and even boasting about his manhood during a national debate. But every time political pundits and reporters thought Trump was done for, he seemed to rise like a phoenix from the ashes. And on Election Night, his unlikely win proved he may well have been the ultimate Teflon candidate. Some of his improbable actions were overlooked by voters who simply couldn't stomach voting for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. And despite winning the popular vote by nearly 3 million, her lack of a prominent economic message and lack of focus on Rust Belt states led to losing the Electoral College and the presidency to Trump. The billionaire real-estate mogul and reality TV star managed to craft a populist appeal that helped him around these 11 times he seemed to be done for: 1. John McCain is ""not a war hero"" Just a month after launching what seemed like a quixotic campaign, Trump made the first major misstep that led many, including his then-campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, to believe his bid was over before it really began. At a forum in Iowa, he fired back after Arizona Sen. John McCain, his party's presidential nominee in 2008, had begun criticizing Trump's hard-line rhetoric on illegal immigrants and Mexicans. Trump pulled no punches when asked about McCain, who spent more than five years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, where he was repeatedly beaten and tortured. ""He's not a war hero. He's a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren't captured,"" Trump replied glibly. Trump, who received multiple deferments for the draft during Vietnam, never apologized. He doubled down, and he came out unscathed. In an odd way, his former campaign operatives argue, it lent a degree of authenticity to his candidacy. It became a model for the rest of his campaign. Months later, Trump maintained he had no regrets for his comments about McCain, though he did later admit McCain was a ""hero."" ""You do things, and you say things. And what I said, frankly, is what I said. And, you know, some people like what I said, if you want to know the truth,"" Trump told radio host Don Imus in May. ""Many people that like what I said. You know, after I said that, my poll numbers went up 7 points."" 2. Trump says he's never asked God for forgiveness Other comments Trump made during that same Iowa event were somewhat overshadowed by his controversial remarks on McCain — but they were no less eyebrow-raising. When asked by moderator Frank Luntz, a GOP message guru, at the event hosted by several religious organizations about his faith, Trump said he was Christian — but made some comments very much out of step with the central beliefs of evangelical Christianity. ""I am not sure I have,"" Trump responded when asked if he had ever asked for forgiveness for his sins from God — a critical step for born-again Christians, who believe that ""all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."" He continued: ""I just go on and try to do a better job from there. I don't think so. I think if I do something wrong, I think, I just try and make it right. I don't bring God into that picture. I don't."" Trump said he does participate in communion but described the sacrament in quite unusual terms. ""When I drink my little wine — which is about the only wine I drink — and have my little cracker, I guess that is a form of asking for forgiveness, and I do that as often as possible because I feel cleansed,"" Trump said. It was all an unusual turn from traditional Iowa GOP politics. Remember that in the 2000 campaign, then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush was applauded during a debate for saying Jesus was the philosopher he admired most. It endeared him to the evangelical community. Questions abounded during this campaign about whether Trump's awkward and unlikely dance with evangelical voters would cost him votes. Answer: No. Even though many evangelical leaders spoke out against him, he won a whopping 81 percent of white evangelical voters, according to exit polls. 3. Feud with Megyn Kelly: She had ""blood coming out of her wherever"" Taking on a Fox News host in a GOP primary debate is usually not a good idea if you are a Republican candidate. But Trump did just that in the very first GOP primary debate of the 2016 cycle, taking on the network's highest-rated anchor no less, Megyn Kelly. His answer to her question in that debate ignited a feud between Trump and Kelly that would continue through much of the election. Kelly began with a blunt statement to Trump on his comments about women: ""You've called women you don't like fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals."" She asked: ""Does that sound to you like the temperament of a man we should elect as president, and how will you answer the charge from Hillary Clinton, who was likely to be the Democratic nominee, that you are part of the war on women?"" Trump didn't like that line of questioning whatsoever, and he made his displeasure known the next day after the debate, when he called in to Fox rival cable network CNN and unloaded — for half an hour. ""She gets out, and she starts asking me all sorts of ridiculous questions,"" Trump said. ""You could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her — wherever. In my opinion, she was off base."" Trump denied he was talking about menstruation and instead was referencing her nose. The vulgar apparent insinuation remained, there was much outrage from various political corners, and Trump's appeal only grew larger. 4. Megyn Kelly feud, part 2: skipping the final Iowa debate  Trump's battle with Kelly continued for months, and he followed through on one threat — that he wouldn't participate in the next Fox News debate if she was one of the moderators. And despite it being the final debate before the Iowa caucuses, when the cameras started rolling on Jan. 29, Trump wasn't there. Instead, he elected to hold his own counterprogramming with a fundraiser for veterans' groups that was also broadcast live on rival channels. Still, skipping such a high-profile debate just before the first votes of the primary season was a risky move, and an unprecedented one, like much of Trump's candidacy, because it could cost him the all-important state of Iowa. Trump claimed he raised over $6 million for various organizations with his competing event, but it wasn't until reporters like the Washington Post's David Fahrenthold started digging that it became apparent not all the money had been fully distributed yet. Trump was pressured into holding a combative press conference at the end of May to give a full accounting of those donations, which ended up totaling just $5.6 million; he said it took four months to give out the donations due to vetting of the different groups. 5. Losing Iowa Trump suffered a major setback in the first major contest in the primary. He lost Iowa, finishing second to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. And yet, Trump became the Comeback Kid with a ""big league"" win in New Hampshire. Trump would go on to cruise through much of the rest of the primary season, fending off Cruz and others. 6. Trump defends his manhood: ""I guarantee you there's no problem"" Trump would participate in all the remaining debates, which made for many memorable moments. But none stood out so much as when Trump made an unusual defense of the size of his, um, manhood during a March debate. Trump was responding to renewed attention to the size of his hands, stemming from past reports that he was particularly sensitive about having small hands. Desperate to make a splash, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio had begun to jab at Trump in recent days. ""He's always calling me Little Marco. And I'll admit he's taller than me. He's like 6-2, which is why I don't understand why his hands are the size of someone who is 5-2,"" Rubio said. ""And you know what they say about men with small hands? You can't trust them."" On the debate stage days later, Trump wanted all of America to know there was ""no problem"" with the size of his hands — or any other part of his anatomy. ""Look at those hands, are they small hands?"" Trump asked, raising them up ""And, [Rubio] referred to my hands — 'if they're small, something else must be small.' I guarantee you there's no problem. I guarantee."" 7. Mocking a disabled reporter Trump was extremely sensitive to any and all criticism of him, especially reporters calling into question the facts. Such was the case with New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski, who said Trump's claim, citing Kovaleski's reporting, that ""thousands and thousands of people"" cheered the collapse of the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001, was false. Kovaleski's reporting, then for the Washington Post, included a line that authorities were questioning some people who were allegedly seen throwing ""tailgate-style parties"" from rooftops as the towers burned. Kovaleski explained that they couldn't verify this claim, and that it certainly wasn't ""thousands and thousands."" At a rally, Trump went after Kovaleski, who has a congenital condition called arthrogryposis that limits the movement of his arms. ""You gotta see this guy,"" Trump said at a November 2015 rally in South Carolina. Trump began flailing his arms, making wild motions and holding his arms at an odd angle. ""Ahh, I don't know what I said! Ahh, I don't remember,"" Trump continued in a mocking voice. Trump maintained he wasn't mocking Kovaleski or his condition and had never met the reporter or knew what he looked like — despite having been interviewed by him many times previously. Of all of Trump's offenses, an August Bloomberg poll found, this was the worst in the minds of voters thus far. 8. The ""Mexican"" judge  Trump was defensive again about fraud lawsuits against Trump University. Trump claimed in an interview with the Wall Street Journal that U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel had an ""absolute conflict"" in deciding the case, because he is ""of Mexican heritage"" and Trump had promised to build a wall along the southern U.S. border. Curiel was born in Indiana. The backlash to Trump's comments was swift. Trump maintained they weren't racist, even though he was saying Curiel couldn't do his job fairly because of his heritage. Other top Republicans disagreed. House Speaker Paul Ryan said Trump's comments were ""the textbook definition of a racist comment."" 9. Trump goes after a Gold Star family Perhaps the most high-profile and surprising critics on whom Trump unleashed his wrath were Khizr and Ghazala Khan. The Gold Star family spoke at the Democratic National Convention about their son, Humayun Khan, a Muslim Army captain who was killed in Iraq in 2004 serving the United States. They criticized Trump's call for banning Muslims from coming into the U.S. ""Let me ask you, have you even read the United States Constitution? I will gladly lend you my copy,"" Khizr Khan said, holding up a copy. ""In this document, look for the words 'liberty' and 'equal protection of law.' "" He continued: ""Have you ever been to Arlington Cemetery? Go look at the graves of brave patriots who died defending the United States of America. You will see all faiths, genders and ethnicities. You have sacrificed nothing and no one."" The story likely would have been a short-lived convention moment were it not for Trump firing back days later. He told ABC's George Stephanopoulos that he had ""made a lot of sacrifices"" by employing ""thousands and thousands of people"" at his businesses. He also questioned why Mrs. Khan didn't speak at the convention. ""If you look at his wife, she was standing there. She had nothing to say. She probably — maybe she wasn't allowed to have anything to say. You tell me,"" Trump said, implying she wasn't permitted to because of her religion. Ghazala Khan later said in a TV interview that she didn't speak because she was still in too much pain over losing her son. Again, top Republicans were swift in their rebukes. McCain said Trump's nomination did not give him ""unfettered license to defame those who are the best among us."" Ohio Gov. John Kasich, a former rival of Trump's, tweeted, ""There's only one way to talk about Gold Star parents: with honor and respect."" Ryan weighed in again, criticizing Trump's proposed Muslim ban and reiterating he was against a religious test of any kind. ""Many Muslim Americans have served valiantly in our military, and made the ultimate sacrifice,"" Ryan said. ""Capt. Khan was one such brave example. His sacrifice — and that of Khizr and Ghazala Khan — should always be honored. Period."" The weeks following the controversy were Trump's worst in public polling. But Trump continued a frenetic campaign schedule, while Clinton stayed out of the limelight and held virtually zero campaign events — instead focusing on raising money. 10. ""Second Amendment people"" may be able to stop Clinton As the general election campaign wore on, so did much of Trump's controversial rhetoric, some of which veered toward dangerous territory. At an August rally in North Carolina, Trump appeared to suggest taking up arms against Clinton over her opposition to gun rights. ""Hillary wants to abolish — essentially abolish — the Second Amendment,"" Trump said. ""If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks. Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is. I don't know."" (Clinton never called for abolishing the Second Amendment, only for tougher gun-control measures). Trump claimed his statement was distorted by the ""dishonest media."" But the Secret Service reportedly sat down with Trump to explain the potential consequences of his remarks. More than a month later, though, Trump made a similar statement, criticizing Clinton for being surrounded by armed Secret Service guards and suggesting that, perhaps, they should stop carrying guns and ""see what happens to her."" ""I think that her bodyguards should drop all weapons,"" Trump said. ""They should disarm, right? I think they should disarm. Immediately. What do you think? Yeah, take their guns away. She doesn't want guns. Take their — let's see what happens to her. Take their guns away, OK? It'll be very dangerous."" Trump's campaign claimed he was simply being ""sarcastic."" 11. And, of course, ""grab them by the p****"" No other statement from Trump seemed like it would have as far-reaching an impact as the ones that surfaced on Oct. 7, from 11 years prior. The biggest bombshell, the ""October surprise"" of October surprises, came when a 2005 Access Hollywood tape leaked in which Trump can be heard bragging to show host Billy Bush about groping women. ""I'm automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything,"" he boasted. ""Grab them by the p****. You can do anything,"" Trump continued, using vulgar slang for female anatomy. Trump didn't apologize for much in this campaign. But he did about this. He issued a rare video apology but dismissed the comments as simply ""locker room talk."" That phrase became a talking point of supporters willing to look past even this. It seemed to get worse for Trump when, after denying during a debate that he had ever done those things, multiple women came forward saying Trump did to them exactly what he had bragged about on tape. Trump said the women were lying. He then attacked them, implying that some weren't attractive enough for him to have hit on. He promised that after the election, he would sue them. These incidents and allegations seemed to be on a different level than even many of his past controversies. Many prominent Republicans began to withdraw their support from Trump and called on him to drop out. But many later reversed course, reaffirming their endorsements of the GOP nominee, and, in the end, Trump convinced enough voters to make him the next president of the United States.

npr,"December 28, 2016",What Role Will Ivanka Trump Play In Her Father's Administration?," COKIE ROBERTS, BYLINE: Hi, Rachel. This is fun. MARTIN: This is very fun. I had the same question. So let's listen to one of our listeners explain. Here is the question. KAREN OLSTAD: My name is Karen Olstad, and I live in Bellingham, Wash. I heard that Ivanka Trump will get an office in the White House in the same space reserved for the first lady. Ivanka's title is still to be determined. What's wrong with first lady if she's doing the job? Is there a regulation that the first lady has to be the wife of the president? Thanks. MARTIN: So, Cokie? ROBERTS: Actually, we think that the title first lady was designed for someone who was not the wife of the president. The first time that that title was ever in the newspapers was during the Buchanan administration, when his niece, Harriet Lane, was serving as first lady. He was our only bachelor president. It was a terrible time, of course, in America - right before the Civil War. She got high marks for trying to keep Northerners and Southerners from killing each other in the White House. But the title first lady probably didn't start with her. It would also be true that Ivanka Trump has been saying that she doesn't expect to have an office in the White House, but she is likely to play a role because she's clearly one of her father's major advisers. And she probably will play that hostess role, at least until Melania arrives in Washington later in the year. MARTIN: A hostess role is one thing, but weighing in on policy is something different. And Ivanka Trump has talked about being interested in - in real, substantive issues - child care in particular, issues related to working moms. Have we seen other first daughters be in this position before? ROBERTS: Well, we've seen first daughters really be powerful - back to the James Monroe administration, when his wife, Elizabeth Monroe, was not well, and his daughter, Eliza Hay, took over the first lady role. And she was very powerful in Washington, and nobody could stand her. She was mean. In fact, I'm quoting now from her successor, Louisa Katherine Adams, the wife of John Quincy Adams, who said she is ""so proud and so mean, no reputation is safe in her hands."" MARTIN: Whoa. ROBERTS: ""And I never, since the first moment of my acquaintance with her, have heard her speak well of any human being."" And Margaret Truman also filled in a lot. And then you had other first daughters, like Maureen Reagan, who was co-chair of the Republican National Committee, but definitely not first lady. MARTIN: We've seen first ladies in the past take on kind of an issue that's their signature cause. Mrs. Trump - Melania Trump - has said she wants to address cyber-bullying. How did this originate? ROBERTS: Actually, Martha Washington, right there, right at the start, lobbied Congress for veterans' benefits because she had been at camp with the Revolutionary War soldiers every winter of the long Revolutionary War. And many first ladies since then have taken on these roles of finding a cause but also exerting power. And it's been interesting to see Mrs. Obama say how she's willing to help Mrs. Trump along these lines, in the same way that Mrs. Bush helped her. MARTIN: Well, you have actually sat down, on a couple of occasions, with Mrs. Obama and Mrs. Bush, who genuinely seem to have some kind of rapport. How important is it in presidential transitions that first ladies communicate well? ROBERTS: It makes it much, much easier for the incoming administration. And Michelle Obama says that Laura Bush has been there with her from the beginning. And interviewing the two women together is a delight because they really, genuinely are friends, but they're also very interested in bettering the positions of women and girls around the world, something they plan to do together. It would set a good example for the men, Rachel. (LAUGHTER) MARTIN: Indeed. Commentator and columnist Cokie Roberts - she will join us Wednesdays to answer your questions. You can tweet us at MORNING EDITION with the hashtag #askcokie. Of course, you can join the conversation on Snapchat. Snap us at NPR. Or you can email us the old-fashioned way - askcokie@npr.org.

npr,"December 28, 2016","As A Great Communicator, Did Obama Make The Case For His Agenda?"," President Obama came into the White House eight years ago, hailed for his skills as a communicator. But as he leaves office, by his own admission, Obama hasn't always been so skilled at making the case for his initiatives or for his achievements. NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith has this look at how the first major achievement of Obama's presidency played out. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Even before President Obama moved into the White House, he and his team made a choice that made actually selling his policies to the public more difficult. In December, 2008, Obama's economic team gathered in Chicago to map out what would become the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. AUSTAN GOOLSBEE: A dispute, discussion, something breaks out at that meeting. We haven't even come in yet. KEITH: Austan Goolsbee is a professor at the University of Chicago and was a top economic adviser in the early years of the Obama presidency. He says there were two schools of thought. GOOLSBEE: Doing something on the order of magnitude of the problem, which everyone understood is going to be a collection of a whole bunch of things and you're going to have a hard time explaining it. KEITH: Or... GOOLSBEE: Couldn't we just pick one thing and just do that one thing, and that would be really easy to explain? KEITH: The economy was hemorrhaging jobs. And Obama's economic team was afraid the country was on the brink of another Great Depression. The president chose to go big. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Today does mark the beginning of the end, the beginning of what we need to do to create jobs for Americans scrambling in the wake of layoffs. KEITH: Obama signed the Recovery Act in February of 2009. And even in that speech, the challenges of explaining the behemoth $780 billion package were clear. He talked about the millions of jobs it would save or create, a metric so squishy it proved hard for Obama to claim credit for it later and made it easy for opponents to criticize the stimulus as a failure. He spent most of this speech talking about investments. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) OBAMA: Rebuilding our crumbling roads and bridges, repairing our faulty dams and levees, bringing critical broadband connections to businesses and homes in nearly every community in America, upgrading mass transit. KEITH: But Frank Luntz, a Republican messaging expert, says to a lot of Americans, the word investment just sounded like code for big government spending. FRANK LUNTZ: There was real hostility early on, a feeling that it's just an expansion of Washington, and nobody was going to benefit and everyone was going to get stuck with the tab. KEITH: Luntz says Obama's team overestimated Americans' appetite for stimulus spending. Republicans in Congress, who never supported the Recovery Act, repeatedly called it a failed trillion-dollar stimulus. In reality, a big chunk of it went to tax cuts. But in Obama's bill-signing speech, the mention of those tax cuts came near the end. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) OBAMA: About a third of this package comes in the forms of tax cuts, by the way, the most progressive in our history, not only spurring job creation but putting money in the pockets of 95 percent of hardworking families in America. (APPLAUSE) KEITH: The way the tax cuts were distributed also limited any public relations benefit. The money just appeared in people's paychecks as a smaller payroll tax deduction. LUNTZ: Nobody realized. Nobody understood, and so nobody celebrated it. KEITH: Again, Republican consultant Frank Luntz. LUNTZ: There's a simple rule in politics. If you don't talk about it, no one knows you did it, and you get no credit for it. And that was the problem with the tax cut component of Obama's stimulus package. KEITH: Goolsbee says that carefully designed tax cuts targeted at working Americans got little traction with the public. GOOLSBEE: At one point in the first year, there's a poll that comes out in which something like 60 percent of the country said that they were sick of the tax increases that had come from the stimulus, when in fact 95 percent had gone down. KEITH: Goolsbee says this is when he began to realize that reality was relative, something that has truly taken hold in American politics now. GOOLSBEE: And at that point, you know, the president was basically asking the economic team, what is wrong with you people? (Laughter) And, you know, I just felt like punching myself. KEITH: Economists widely view the stimulus as having helped. But politically, Obama got none of the credit for the tax cuts and a whole lot of grief for the spending. This was a pattern that would repeat itself throughout his presidency. Tamara Keith, NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF CHRISTIAN SCOTT SONG, ""LITANY AGAINST FEAR"") Copyright © 2016 NPR.

npr,"December 27, 2016","Trump Decries His Foundation's Closure, Overstating Its Giving"," President-elect Donald Trump is lashing out in defense of his charitable foundation as he prepares to shutter it before taking the oath of office next month. And in doing so, Trump incorrectly stated the charitable reach of the Donald J. Trump Foundation. In a series of tweets Monday evening, Trump said he had given millions to the foundation he began in 1987 and that all of the money raised went to ""wonderful charities."" I gave millions of dollars to DJT Foundation, raised or recieved millions more, ALL of which is given to charity, and media won't report!  The DJT Foundation, unlike most foundations, never paid fees, rent, salaries or any expenses. 100% of money goes to wonderful charities! But extensive reporting over the past year has shown those claims to be overstated. According to the Washington Post's David Fahrenthold, who has researched the foundation's donations and expenses for several months, Trump and his companies have given about $6 million to the charity since its launch, according to tax records up to 2015. However, the president-elect has not given anything to the foundation from 2009 until 2014; his businesses gave to the foundation in 2015 for the first time in several years, according to the Post. In fact, the two largest donors were professional wrestling magnates Vince and Linda McMahon, who gave $5 million to the foundation from 2007 until 2009. Trump has nominated Linda McMahon to lead the Small Business Administration. And as Fahrenthold reported during the campaign, not all of the money was solely for charitable purposes. In many cases, spending benefited Trump and his business interests. Trump used his foundation's money to buy a 6-foot-tall portrait of himself for $20,000, and had earlier bought another portrait for $10,000, the Post's reporting showed. He also used the foundation's money to buy an autographed Tim Tebow Denver Broncos helmet for $12,000. Trump tapped his foundation to help settle lawsuits for his businesses. In one case, Palm Beach, Fla., agreed to forgive fines for Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club if he made a $100,000 donation to a veterans' charity. In another instance, Trump settled a case involving one of his New York golf courses to make a $158,000 donation to a charity of the plaintiff's choosing. ""So if Trump is using this money basically to save his businesses, the money isn't helping people. That's a violation of the letter and the spirit of law,"" Fahrenthold told NPR's All Things Considered on Sunday. Trump announced on Christmas Eve that ""to avoid even the appearance of any conflict with my role as President I have decided to continue to pursue my strong interest in philanthropy in other ways."" But Trump cannot shutter the foundation just yet since it's under investigation by the New York attorney general, according to the office's spokeswoman Amy Spitalnick. Attorney General Eric Schneiderman ordered the foundation to stop raising money in New York in October, saying it wasn't registered by law to be able to do so in the state. And last year Trump had to pay a $2,500 fine to the IRS when he used $25,000 of the foundation's money to donate to a group supporting Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. At the time, she was weighing whether or not to pursue an investigation into Trump University; ultimately, she decided not to, and this year was a vocal surrogate for Trump. RealClearPolitics also reported in October that many of the Trump Foundation's donations in recent years went to top conservative or policy groups that could aid Trump as he prepared for a White House run. Throughout the campaign, Trump took sharp aim at his opponent Hillary Clinton's own family foundation, claiming it was a pay-to-play vehicle for the Democratic nominee and her husband, former President Bill Clinton. ""It is impossible to figure out where the Clinton Foundation ends and the State Department begins. It is now abundantly clear that the Clintons set up a business to profit from public office,"" Trump said at an August rally in Texas. ""They sold access and specific actions by and really for I guess the making of large amounts of money."" Those claims have not been borne out by evidence. In August, the Clintons vowed to drastically reduce the size of their foundation to avoid appearances of conflict. They denied any insinuation of pay-to-play and defended the work of the Clinton Foundation. At the time, RNC chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement, ""If everything was above board while Hillary Clinton ran the State Department as the Clintons have said, then why change a thing?"" But now it's Trump and his family who have come under fire for some of the same alleged behaviors. An AP investigation found that Trump's son Eric "" has exaggerated the size of his foundation and the donations it receives. At the same time, the charity's payments for services or donations to other groups repeatedly went to one of Donald Trump's private golf clubs and to charities linked to the Trumps by corporate, family or philanthropic relationships."" My wonderful son, Eric, will no longer be allowed to raise money for children with cancer because of a possible conflict of interest with... my presidency. Isn't this a ridiculous shame? He loves these kids, has raised millions of dollars for them, and now must stop. Wrong answer! Eric Trump announced last week he would also close his personal foundation after it was auctioning off a coffee with his sister, Ivanka, who is expected to have considerable influence in her father's White House. The president-elect also tweeted about that last Friday, saying it was a ""ridiculous shame"" that Eric would have to stop fundraising for his foundation, which gave much of its money to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.  Back in October, NPR's Joel Rose compared the Trump and Clinton foundations and found some marked differences. While the Clinton Foundation does have hundreds of employees and a large budget, it spent almost 90 cents of every dollar received on charitable causes, such as HIV and malaria prevention in Africa. It's a public charity, meaning it mostly raises money from other people and organizations (including a gift from the Trump Foundation in 2009). And while it did accept money from foreign donors, some of whom wanted meetings when Clinton was secretary of state, ""there's no evidence that big donors got any special favors from the State Department,"" Rose reported. The Trump Foundation is a private foundation, originally intended to give away Trump's own money. But, as noted earlier, he stopped making personal contributions about eight years ago. ""The Trump Foundation has engaged in documented, flagrant acts of violation,"" said Pamela Mann, a former head of the charities bureau in the New York attorney general's office, told Rose. ""That's really different."" NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor ",http://www.npr.org/507143418
npr,"December 27, 2016",From Delay To Action: The Supreme Court To Take A Conservative Turn In 2017," On Jan. 20, 2016, exactly a year before a new president would be sworn into office, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia announced the court's 8-to-1 decision reinstating the death penalty for two Kansas brothers. It was the last time the 79-year-old Scalia would announce an opinion. Three weeks later, on a hunting trip in Texas, the conservative icon died in his sleep. Since then, the year has been one long roller-coaster ride for the Supreme Court, with the eight remaining justices putting off the most controversial cases while President Obama and the U.S. Senate struggled over filling the vacancy.

 Former Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, pictured in 2011. His death Feb. 13 set in motion an unprecedented delay for confirmation hearings for President Obama's pick to replace him. Republicans were shocked and horrified at Scalia's death. Not only was he a revered figure in the conservative community, but he was the fifth conservative vote on a court that was often split along liberal-conservative lines. What's more, though, it was an election year. There was plenty of time to confirm a replacement, and no precedent for stalling for nearly a year to stave off that possibility. If Obama could fill the slot, it would mean that for the first time in a half-century, a majority of the justices would be Democratic appointees. Within hours of Scalia's death, however, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell vowed to block consideration of anyone Obama would nominate to the court. The choice, McConnell said, should be made by the next president, after the election, to ""give the people a voice in filling this vacancy."" Obama tried to finesse an appointment, picking as his nominee a relative centrist, a man Republicans had urged him to appoint when there were earlier vacancies: Merrick Garland, the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, and a man beloved and respected by his colleagues on both the right and the left. 
                Senate leader Mitch McConnell speaks to the media Feb. 23, 10 days after Justice Scalia's death. He said GOP leadership would deny confirmation hearings for any Obama nominee to fill the vacancy.

 Senate leader Mitch McConnell speaks to the media Feb. 23, 10 days after Justice Scalia's death. He said GOP leadership would deny confirmation hearings for any Obama nominee to fill the vacancy. Obama kept pointing out that he had fulfilled his constitutional duty. ""Now it's time for the Senate to do their job,"" he declared. ""Give Judge Garland a hearing. Give Judge Garland an up-or-down vote."" But McConnell didn't budge. His position was so unprecedented that many Republicans, in addition to Democrats, thought the GOP would pay a price at the polls for such obstructionism. The ploy, however, turned out to be ingenious. Twisting arms and making quiet threats, McConnell managed to keep his own Senate troops in line. Meanwhile, candidate Donald Trump was catering to the socially conservative base of the Republican Party by promising to name a Scalia-like conservative to the court. And while Hillary Clinton rarely mentioned the court on the campaign trail, Trump drove the issue home relentlessly day after day. ""You have no choice,"" he told conservatives. ""You got to go for Trump."" To allay their fears further, Trump released a list of 21 potential Supreme Court nominees, largely compiled by the conservative Heritage Foundation. Moreover, in the aftermath of the election, Trump said what he had not before — he would fill the Scalia vacancy with someone from that list. Among the 21, the odds-on favorite is federal appeals court Judge William Pryor of Alabama, mainly because Trump's attorney general designate, Jeff Sessions, is also from Alabama and has considerable influence with the president-elect. Judge Pryor is an outspoken critic of Supreme Court decisions on abortion, gay rights and the so-called Miranda warning. But when he was Alabama's attorney general, he won points among many for his role in removing the state's chief justice for refusing to obey a federal court order to take a Ten Commandments monument out of the courthouse. Also believed to be at the top of the short list is Judge Diane Sykes, a federal appeals court judge from Wisconsin, with a bedrock conservative record. She authored an opinion expanding the rights of employers to limit their workers' access to contraceptives on religious grounds. She wrote an opinion striking down Chicago's law banning firing ranges within city limits. And she wrote an opinion mandating state subsidies for anti-gay religious groups on college campuses, a position the Supreme Court subsequently reversed. Also believed to be on the Trump short list are other serious conservative judges from the federal appeals courts. Among them: Raymond Kethledge of Michigan, who ordered the IRS to turn over a list of conservative groups it had targeted for examination; Judge Thomas Hardiman of Pennsylvania, who dissented when his court upheld a New Jersey law that required citizens to show a ""demonstrated"" need for carrying a gun in public; Judge Raymond Gruender of Missouri, who wrote a decision upholding state-mandated suicide warnings before abortions; and Judge Steven Colloton, who is known for a number of decisions reversing major verdicts that favored whistleblowers and consumers. Judge Colloton has a particular plus; he is from Iowa, the home state of the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Republican Charles Grassley. Many of these potential nominees are said to have sympathetic personal stories. Judge Sykes, for instance, raised two children as a single mother after her divorce. Judge Gruender, the son of a janitor, had a childhood touched by family violence. In 1986, when he was a law student, his father pointed a gun at him, his sister and a younger brother. Gruender and his sister were shot, but Gruender was able to knock his father to the floor, saving his 12-year-old brother, according to local news reports. There are other names on the Trump list, and as we have seen with other high-profile slots, Trump is more than willing to change his mind. But with Trump and his team now pushing to name and confirm his Cabinet, settling on a Supreme Court nominee is not immediately on the front burner. It likely will happen after the new president is sworn in. An announcement is expected in January or early February, with confirmation hearings sometime in March and, unless there are unforeseen difficulties, a vote by the full Senate sometime in April. Even if the Senate is able to meet that schedule, however, the Supreme Court term will almost be over, with just six days of oral arguments left on the schedule in late April. Just what approach the Democrats will take would seem to depend on who is nominated for the vacant Scalia seat, and what is learned about the nominee and his or her record. The Democrats could filibuster, but anything more than a token talkathon is likely to provoke Republicans into changing the rules and abolishing the filibuster as it applies to Supreme Court confirmations. Some Republicans would prefer not to do that, but if it proves necessary, GOP leader McConnell will likely make the move, just as Democrats would have done if they had won the presidency and the Senate.

npr,"December 27, 2016",How Conservatives Elected A Non-Traditionalist For President," MATT LEWIS: Thank you. MARTIN: Your party now controls both houses of Congress and the White House. In any other year, this should be hailed as a massive victory for conservatism. Is it? LEWIS: Well, that remains to be seen. You know, Donald Trump is not a great conservative. I don't even think he is a conservative, but he could end up doing a lot of conservative things. And the Supreme Court picks, I think, are part of the reason that a lot, especially evangelical Christian conservatives, supported him. And it very well could end up that he nominates multiple conservative Supreme Court justices that will outlast, you know, him as president and that would be an enduring legacy. MARTIN: There were a lot of fissures within the GOP that were exposed over the course of the election. At a tactical level, when we think about Congress coming back next week and the picks that Donald Trump has made for some of his top Cabinet posts, how much pushback are we likely to see from more mainstream conservatives to those picks? LEWIS: Well, I don't think much. I think that if you're a mainstream conservative, these are really good picks. And they're picks that suggest that Trump wants to do stuff. Betsy DeVos said education - who is a school choice advocate - that's a pick that Bobby Jindal or Marco Rubio could have made. You've got someone like Mike Flynn as national security adviser - not in the Cabinet per se. He might, you know, I don't - I don't know that he would have been at the top of somebody else's list but clearly experienced, clearly somebody who has a lot of knowledge about, you know, national security issues. MARTIN: Although, I should point out, John Bolton has been floated as a name. It was for secretary of state - now floated as a deputy secretary. Senator Rand Paul on this program told us he'd pushback on that nomination. LEWIS: I think he would. As a more libertarian conservative, he would have concerns about his foreign policy. I think that the - speaking of secretary of state, I think that the Rex Tillerson pick is the one that could get the most pushback, and that's because if his close connection with Vladimir Putin and Russia. And you could have sort of Reagan conservative hawks like John McCain and Marco Rubio and Lindsey Graham pushing back and possibly helping Democrats block that nomination. I think we'll have to see how it goes. But that would be the one red flag. Also I think the Jeff Sessions pick... MARTIN: For attorney general, yeah. LEWIS: I think Republicans are going to coalesce around Jeff Sessions for attorney general. But I do think Democrats will try to make an issue of it and probably try to cast him as a racist. MARTIN: In your book, you write - and I'm quoting here - ""this is the dirty little secret of the conservative movement in America today - everyone knows that it has lost its intellectual bearings."" How did that happen? LEWIS: Well, it happened over the course of many, many years, and there are numerous reasons for why this happened and the dumbing down that took place on the right and in the Republican Party and in the conservative movement. I'll just tell you one of the more interesting reasons I think is that it worked. And so you had politicians like Dwight Eisenhower, you know, who essentially planned the D-Day invasion who was incredibly intelligent, who cast himself as sort of this affable, grandfatherly figure who was very confused and avuncular. He did that to get the press all - you know, when he wanted to sort of change the subject, he did that intentionally. Ronald Reagan - incredibly well-read, incredibly intelligent, played the aw shucks - was described as, quote, ""an affable dunce."" He did that on purpose. He did what George W. Bush called being misunderestimated. It was a strategy, and it worked. Being underestimated did work for these Republican presidents. I think that there was an unintended consequence, which was that the Republican Party became the stupid party. MARTIN: And how have you seen that manifest in the past year? LEWIS: Well, I think that clearly if you look at the rise of Donald Trump, this is a guy who won partly because he was a celebrity and partly because that he was seen as a straight talker and that, you know, authenticity isn't necessarily the opposite of intellectualism or substance. But sometimes I think we confuse the two. And sometimes if you just say I - quote, ""I'm not being politically incorrect,"" that is an excuse to say really kind of stupid things. MARTIN: Matt Lewis - he's a senior contributor to The Daily Caller and a CNN political analyst. His book is called ""Too Dumb To Fail."" Matt, thanks. We'll have you back again. LEWIS: Thank you.

npr,"December 27, 2016","If Chosen To Be DNC Chief, Jaime Harrison Pledges To Rebuild The Party"," JAIME HARRISON: We got spoiled because we had the political phenom of Barack Obama.

GREENE: Harrison said the party really needs to be rebuilt from the ground up. HARRISON: The people who are elected on local levels have just as much impact, if not more, on the day-to-day lives of citizens. And so we can't just be focused on the White House. If we do what we have to do on a state level, then the White House is gravy. And that's the focus. GREENE: Gravy? HARRISON: It really is because then you have strong... GREENE: That is making it sound pretty easy, especially after a big loss. Like, it's really just gravy? HARRISON: Yeah, it is. And let me tell you this - look at the victories in 2006 and in 2008. Howard Dean started the 50-state strategy in 2006. I don't know if folks remember. The 2004 election was probably just as sobering of election for Democrats. We lost everything. But what happened is Howard Dean came, enacted this 50-state strategy, and we won the House and the Senate back in '06. And then based on that foundation, we grew the majorities in the House and the Senate and added the president. GREENE: So Howard Dean has been talked about as a potential candidate for this job. Why not just throw your support behind him? HARRISON: Well, partly because I also believe I bring a different dynamic in addition to what Governor Dean, who is a friend and a mentor and, I think, a great visionary for our party. I also bring a lot of youth and the energy and creativity. We've been doing some really extra things here in South Carolina to build our party infrastructure and our organization, from the issues conference that we have that we host every year to get activists trained to talk about and discuss policy, to the South Carolina Democrats Care initiative, where we're going back into communities, helping people address the day-to-day issues that they have. So I bring that type of mentality. And listen, frankly, if I become DNC chair at the age of 40, I'll probably half the average age of Democratic leadership in Washington, D.C. GREENE: (Laughter) You might have some older Democrats who are hearing that and grimacing a little bit. Let me just ask you - you've also spent a good portion of your career working at the Podesta Group, a lobbying firm founded by Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta. What do you say to someone who would say, you know what? I really want something different. I don't want someone who is very close to Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman after Hillary Clinton just lost the presidential election. I want a fresh face here. HARRISON: Yeah, well, this is the thing - John Podesta has not worked at the Podesta Group since 1990 - the 1990s. GREENE: But it's still his organization - a lot of people with close ties to him. I mean, you're in - you're in that world. HARRISON: Well, it's not his organization because I've never worked for John. But nonetheless, this is the thing - you know, I bring a different perspective. I will probably be the - if elected chair - probably the only person that's ever been on food stamps that's been chairman of the Democrat Party, the only chair that will have over $160,000 of student loan debt. I mean, I can relate to the story of so many in this country who started behind the start line and now are trying to become successful. GREENE: Whose idea was this for you to run for this job? HARRISON: It was mine. Listen, my name was mentioned a few times when Secretary Clinton was possible President-elect Clinton. And so I had a few conversations with with some of her staff about it. And then, after the election and the results, I felt that I still brought a new perspective to bear. GREENE: Jamie Harrison, Keith Ellison, congressman from Minnesota, is seen as one of, if not, the leading candidate to be DNC chair. We've had him on the program - also a compelling life story, a lot of experience in Congress. He was a supporter of Bernie Sanders. Are you sort of the - the team-Hillary-Clinton candidate who people who supported Clinton are kind of getting behind to try and challenge Congressman Ellison? HARRISON: I know that a lot of folks want to rehash the 2016 presidential primary, but I'm not a Clinton Democrat. I'm not an Obama Democrat. I'm not a Sanders Democrat. I'm just a Democrat, one who is raising his son in ruby-red South Carolina and wants to make sure that the opportunities that I've been able to enjoy and the opportunities that so many working people are able to enjoy are ones that persist. And I know that all of those things are in danger with Donald Trump as president. GREENE: All right. Jamie Harrison, pleasure talking to you. Thanks so much for taking the time. HARRISON: Thanks so much for having me. GREENE: He is chair of the South Carolina Democratic Party. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"December 27, 2016",Obama Says He Would Have Won A Third Term Had He Run," In an interview released Monday, President Obama expressed confidence that he would have won the 2016 election had it been possible for him to seek a third term. The president's remarks were hypothetical: The 22nd Amendment to the Constitution limits presidents to two terms in office. Obama made his remarks to The Axe Files, the podcast of his former adviser David Axelrod, now director of the University of Chicago Institute of Politics. The president argued that a majority of Americans continue to support his progressive vision for the country. ""I am confident in this vision, because I'm confident that if I had run again and articulated it, I think I could have mobilized a majority of the American people to rally behind it,"" the president said. ""I know that in conversations that I've had with people around the country,"" he continued, ""even some people who disagreed with me, they would say, 'The vision, the direction that you point towards is the right one.' "" President Obama said that he thinks he would have won against me. He should say that but I say NO WAY! - jobs leaving, ISIS, OCare, etc. President-elect Trump responded via Twitter that he would not have lost a contest with Obama. ""President Obama said that he thinks he would have won against me. He should say that but I say NO WAY! - jobs leaving, ISIS, OCare, etc."" Obama had praise for the Democratic nominee: ""I think that Hillary Clinton performed wonderfully under really tough circumstances."" But he suggested that Clinton, sure of victory, ""played it safe,"" and missed opportunities to present a narrative that would have appealed to voters. Obama also offered criticism of Democrats more broadly, in which he included himself, for failing to convince voters they had benefited from his agenda. ""I think the issue was less that Democrats have somehow abandoned the white working class,"" said the president. ""I think that's nonsense. Look, the Affordable Care Act benefits a huge number of Trump voters. ""The problem is is that we're not there on the ground communicating not only the dry policy aspects of this but that we care about these communities, we're bleeding for these communities."" Obama also expressed grudging admiration for the success of Republican efforts during his time in office to counter his vision for the country. ""[Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell's insight, which I've said just from a pure, tactical perspective was pretty smart and well executed, the degree of discipline that he was able to impose on his caucus, was impressive,"" Obama said. ""His insight was that, 'We just have to say no to that. And if we can just throw sand in the gears, then at a time of deep economic crisis when people are really stressed, really worried ... that if we just say no, that that will puncture the balloon, that all this talk about hope and change, no red state and blue state, is proven to be a mirage, a fantasy.'

npr,"December 27, 2016","The Future Of Medicaid May Be Found In Indiana, Where The Poor Pay"," To get a glimpse of where Medicaid may be headed after Donald Trump moves into the White House, it may be wise to look to Indiana. That's where Seema Verma, Trump's pick to run the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, comes from. And that's where she put her stamp on the state's health care program for the poor. Verma is a private consultant who was hired by Indiana Gov. and Vice President-elect Mike Pence to design a Republican-friendly expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. The state paid her almost $5 million over four years through 2017, according to the contracts. She sees the federal Medicaid program as a bureaucratic nightmare that hamstrings states and encourages poor people to remain dependent. ""The Medicaid program has not kept pace with the modern health-care market,"" she testified at a Congressional hearing in 2013. ""Its rigid, complex rules designed to protect enrollees have also created an intractable program that does not foster efficiency, quality or personal responsibility."" The plan she came up with for Indiana requires poor Medicaid recipients to make monthly payments for their insurance, or lose benefits. 
                Seema Verma, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to run the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, advised Indiana and other states on expanding their Medicaid programs.

 Seema Verma, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to run the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, advised Indiana and other states on expanding their Medicaid programs. ""Seema was very committed to extending coverage to low-income families in Indiana,"" says Cindy Mann, who was the CMS official who negotiated the deal with Verma on that state's Medicaid expansion. She says throughout the negotiations, Verma was ""very committed to a particular ideology. That ideology is very much focused on personal responsibility."" Verma did not respond to multiple requests to be interviewed for this story. Pence was one of the few Republican governors who took the Obama administration up on its offer to pay the lion's share of the costs for states that expanded their Medicaid programs to people whose incomes reach 138 percent of the poverty level, or $16,243. But rather than simply offer coverage to more people, the state sought a waiver to revamp its program. That's the deal that Verma worked out with Mann. Indiana's program, which extended Medicaid to about 246,000 people who weren't eligible before, is infused with Verma's ideas of how to make poor people take responsibility for their health care. It has a complex system of carrots and sticks. Beneficiaries make monthly payments from $1 to about $27 into individual health savings accounts, and the state also contributes. That money can be used for doctor visits and prescriptions. If beneficiaries get vaccines and other preventive care, they get a discount on their premiums the following year. But they can also be penalized. People whose incomes are above the poverty line can be cut off for six months if they miss a payment. Those below the poverty line are knocked down to a plan with fewer benefits. And if a patient unnecessarily goes to the emergency room, extra money comes out of the health savings account. ""There are many ways to try and effectuate personal responsibility,"" Mann says. ""Some states have moved forward with healthy behavior initiatives, for example. Some states have done some premiums and copays."" Indiana's plan requires everyone to contribute to a health savings account. ""And so the responsibility was really translated into payment requirements, and with pretty strong consequences if somebody was unable to pay."" She says Verma and Indiana wanted the penalties to be even harsher — a full year with no coverage for people who miss payments. But CMS rejected that idea. So how does it work in practice? For Amber Thayer, a mom of three who lives in a Volunteers of America family shelter in Indianapolis, it's been a bit of a nightmare. Thayer is a recovering addict who has been clean for six months with the help of the medication Suboxone. And she's training to be a nursing assistant. ""It's been quite, quite the struggle, but we've gotten there and we're doing great, and we're getting ready to get into our own home,"" she says. She pays $1 a month for her Medicaid insurance. In October, she got a bill for that $1 from a different company than the one she had been dealing with. She assumed the state had switched her. ""It is only a dollar,"" she says. ""I could pay a dollar a month, or I could pay $12 and that will cover me for the year. Unfortunately, at that time, I only had I believe it was like $2.38 on my card."" So she called the company and used her bank card to pay the dollar. But the company, or perhaps the state, lost track of her dollar, and her insurance was cut off. She had her bank statement and a receipt from the insurer that proved she had paid. But she still spent six weeks, with multiple phone calls and visits to state health offices, trying to get her coverage restored. All the while, she scraped together enough money to buy Suboxone one dose at a time. ""I'm fearing, you know, the withdraws,"" Thayer recalls. But she was also afraid the loss of insurance would interfere with her ability to take her nursing assistant exam, which in turn would threaten the stipend she gets because she is in job training. ""If I don't get my stipend, we're not going to have our money to help us get into our home."" It's these types of complications that have some advocates worried. Adam Mueller, a lawyer for Indiana Legal Services, says he's happy more of his clients have health insurance. But he says the state's notion that people will feel more invested in their care if they pay $1 a month just doesn't play out in the real world. ""They don't feel like they have skin in the game,"" Mueller says. ""One guy told me that it feels like Indiana is trying to take his last $12."" Joe Thompson, CEO of the Arkansas Center for Health Improvement, says it's just hard to be poor. ""The social stresses of low-income individuals probably make most aspects of managing through the day more difficult than if you have more affluence and have more resources available to deploy,"" he says. Thompson, who's a former Arkansas surgeon general, helped develop a Medicaid program in his state that had many of the same features as Indiana, including premium payments and health savings accounts. In the end, Arkansas decided it just wasn't worth it. ""We had about a year and a half of experience there, and candidly the administrative cost and the operating aspects exceeded what the Legislature subsequently perceived the benefit of that program was,"" Thompson says. So the state scrapped the health savings accounts. He says the ideas about personal responsibility are politically popular, but implementing them is too complex. ""We lose too many folks along the way, and we may be causing more challenges than we're solving,"" he says. Arkansas still charges nominal premiums for some Medicaid recipients, but they pay them directly to insurers. The carrots and sticks and individual accounts are gone. In Indiana, insurers also collect the premiums and administer the individual health savings accounts. James Gavin, a spokesman for the Family and Social Services Administration, says those costs are included in what the state pays the insurance companies, and so it's not clear exactly how much Indiana is spending to administer the health savings accounts. Verma has advised several states, including Iowa, Kentucky and Ohio, that are looking for Medicaid waivers from the federal government. Many of those waiver applications include cost features such as premiums or health savings accounts or incentives for healthy behavior. ""The cost-sharing policy is not to burden the individual,"" she told lawmakers at the 2013 hearing. ""I think it's to incentivize them and empower them to be part of the equation."" When Verma testified in 2013, she urged lawmakers to make the process of getting Medicaid waivers easier. If she's confirmed as administrator of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, it will be her and her staff who review waiver applications and determine whether they should go forward.

npr,"December 27, 2016","For Trump Presidency, Old Ethics Laws Meet New Money-Making Methods"," President-elect Donald Trump's type of wealth — based largely on the value of his brand name and on global real estate holdings — doesn't fit well with existing ethics laws, which were written for an earlier time when rich politicos mainly invested in stocks and bonds. To be clear, some ethics laws do apply to the incoming president. ""He's still subject to bribery laws, he's subject to the STOCK Act, which prohibits insider trading,"" says Larry Noble, general counsel for the Campaign Legal Center, which supports anti-corruption laws. What doesn't apply to presidents is the federal conflict-of-interest law. So for example, Trump can own a golf resort while he also shapes the tax, environmental and labor laws that could affect his golf profits. Noble says Trump could follow the example of other presidents and voluntarily put his holdings into a blind trust. On Fox News earlier this month, Trump said he would give control of his holdings to his children, but that's a less-than-blind arrangement. Now, you may be wondering why there isn't a conflicts law for the president. One argument is that such a law would violate the Constitution. Congress cannot pass a law that restricts a president's decision-making authority. In 1989, a presidential commission was assigned to set ethics standards for all federal officials. But with the Constitution's separation of powers ""we quickly came to the conclusion that that was not possible, for both constitutional and practical reasons,"" says ethics attorney Jan Baran, was served on the commission. So there are conflict-of-interest rules for most government employees. But not the president. And there's another problem with the ethics laws. They were written to cover 20th century wealth, which typically came from stocks and bonds — paper that could be turned over to a trust. But Trump derives much of his fortune from his name, which he licenses on properties all over the world. That's not uncommon these days. Think of Oprah, or Ralph Lauren. That kind of wealth can't be put into a blind trust. Baran says new laws are not needed for this kind of wealth. Presidents just need to do the right thing. ""It will require presidents going forward to figure out how to impose rules on themselves,"" he says. But Norm Eisen, a clean-government advocate at the Brookings Institution, says the best approach lies in a clause that's already in the Constitution: the emoluments clause. Basically, it says government officials cannot take gifts, or emoluments, from foreign officials. Eisen says the founding fathers left room for an expansive interpretation. ""We capture with the very broad language intangible things like the value of Mr Trump's name,"" he explains. Democrats will be pushing for this new interpretation when Congress comes back in January. NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor ",http://www.npr.org/507031998
npr,"December 26, 2016",Obama's Post-White House Plans Include My Brother's Keeper Effort," President Obama says when he leaves the White House, he and Michelle will take a vacation. They'll catch up on sleep. And then he plans to devote time and energy to an initiative aimed at helping young black and brown men. NPR's Scott Horsley reports. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: For most of his time in office, President Obama shied away from policies designed to help any particular racial group, saying he wanted to focus instead on promoting opportunity for everyone. But in launching his My Brother's Keeper initiative three years ago, Obama took a different tack, acknowledging all too often the deck is stacked against young African-American and Latino men. And he says addressing that is a national challenge. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: The only way we live up to America's promise is if we value every single child, not just our own, and invest in every single child as if they're our own. HORSLEY: Over the last three years, Obama has enlisted businesspeople, clergy, athletes and celebrities to mentor and show support for young black and brown men. Shortly before Christmas, he met with some of those volunteers, as well as some of the young people who've been helped by their efforts. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) OBAMA: I see myself in these young people. I grew up without a father. There were times where I made poor choices, times where I was adrift. The only difference between me and a lot of other young men is that I grew up in a more forgiving environment. HORSLEY: Many young people today are not so fortunate. In fact, it was the 2012 killing of Trayvon Martin that gave rise to the president's initiative. After the Neighborhood Watch volunteer who shot the Florida teenager was acquitted, Obama told reporters Trayvon could have been him. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) OBAMA: There are very few African-American men in this country who haven't had the experience of being followed when they were shopping in a department store - that includes me. HORSLEY: Skeptical of launching a big new government program, Obama instead called for Americans to do some soul searching and to look for ways they could help young black and brown men feel more like full parts of society. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) OBAMA: This is something that Michelle and I talk a lot about. There are a lot of kids out there who need help who are getting a lot of negative reinforcement. And is there more that we can do to give them a sense that their country cares about them? HORSLEY: Even before he formally launched My Brother's Keeper, Obama had been working to help young African-American men overcome what are often grim statistics. They're more likely than their white classmates to drop out of school, less likely to find good jobs and more than six times as likely to be murdered. White House adviser Valerie Jarrett recalled that in 2013, Obama met with a group of young men enrolled in a violence prevention program in Chicago. Later, he invited them to the White House for Father's Day. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) VALERIE JARRETT: They gave him a Father's Day card that they had all signed. And one of the young men said, Mr. President, I've never signed a Father's Day card. And the president said, I've never signed one, either. HORSLEY: Malachi Hernandez, who grew up in a tough part of Boston, saw some of himself in the president's story. He and his brothers often felt like something was missing after their father left home when he was 8 years old. Hernandez got a lift from My Brother's Keeper and is now a student at Northeastern University. He introduced the president at that summit meeting just before Christmas. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MALACHI HERNANDEZ: He asked, what are some of the things we would like to see? I emphasized to him that all young people need is love. HORSLEY: Obama says for every young man like Hernandez who's been helped by My Brother's Keeper, there are many more still in need. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) OBAMA: Ensuring that our young people can go as far as their dreams and hard work will take them is the single most important task that we have as a nation. It is the single most important thing we can do for our country's future. HORSLEY: While the government has a role to play, Obama says citizens have to put their time and effort into it as well. The president says that's something he'll be investing in long after he leaves the White House. Scott Horsley, NPR News, Washington. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"December 26, 2016",Experts Hope Trump Makes Cybersecurity An Early Priority," President Obama has promised to take action in response to findings by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia hacked computers at the Democratic National Committee and other Democratic political groups. And one of Donald Trump's first big decisions as president may be whether to continue down the chosen path. State-sponsored hacking is ""arguably one of the biggest threats to the nation,"" says Jay Kaplan, a former analyst at the National Security Agency. State actors are behind numerous recent hacks, including the federal employee records at the Office of Personnel Management, believed to be the work of China. In a recent report on enhancing national cybersecurity, the Obama administration avoided addressing the issue of state-sponsored hacking head-on. But it did recommend steps — including training 100,000 new ""cybersecurity practitioners"" by 2020 — to fix vulnerabilities in government and private networks. Crowdsourcing offers a path to tackle the challenge, Kaplan says. He is CEO of Synack, which is working with the Pentagon using crowdsourcing ""to uncover security holes across the federal government,"" as he puts it. Right now, the effort is focused on the Defense Department, Kaplan says, but he hopes ""to broaden that scope soon."" A new administration may bring other new ways of looking at the problems — or at least that's what Betsy Cooper hopes. She is executive director of the Center for Long-Term Cybersecurity at the University of California, Berkeley. ""We absolutely believe that this is an opportunity for progress,"" Cooper says, ""that a new administration without ties to past government structures creates the opportunity for resetting the playing field."" One proposal is for a cyber workforce incubator to be set up in Silicon Valley, where tech industry experts and government officials could get together to exchange ideas. They would spend a year or two together and then ""each group would rotate back to their normal jobs,"" Cooper says. The idea is that in that period, the government workers will get ""better exposure to the Silicon Valley culture and way of working,"" Cooper says, while those from the tech industry will better understand ""the importance of government problems and the importance of working on these issues in the public sector."" Cooper also suggests a public campaign — like the government has used to get people to buckle their seat belts or to recycle — to get ordinary Americans aware of the importance of things like using strong passwords and other so-called good cyber hygiene practices. It's not just individuals or government systems that need help with cybersecurity issues. ""I think the president should focus on three things: energy, finance and telecom,"" says Melissa Hathaway, president of Hathaway Global Strategies, who has worked on cyber issues in the Obama and George W. Bush administrations. Hathaway, who is also a senior adviser on Harvard University's Cyber Security Project, says the IT systems of utilities and banks have already been infected with malware and are vulnerable to hackers, not only from state sponsors, but also criminals: ""If I can bring a utility offline through ransomware or through some other means,"" she says, ""I can cause them to pay to get it restored."" And she points to recent attacks, in which hackers hijacked Internet-connected devices to bring down online services including Twitter and Spotify. ""It's really important that we stop talking about these problems and start solving them,"" Hathaway says. ""And that's going to require leadership; it's going to require focused attention."" She says if Trump wants to make America great again, he needs to address cybersecurity quickly. NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor ",http://www.npr.org/506998645
npr,"December 26, 2016",4 Things Democrats Need To Do (Plus 1 They Shouldn't) To Rebuild In 2017," The Republican Party heads into 2017 with more power than it has had for a long time. For the Democrats, it's a different matter. Hillary Clinton's loss in the presidential race and Democratic failures further down the ballot have the party searching for a way forward. Here are five things Democrats need to do, as they look for a path out of the political wilderness: 1. Be clear about how bad things are — and are not — for the Democratic Party. Democrats are clear-eyed about the size of the hole they're in. It's deep. Every president loses seats for his party, but no president in U.S. history has presided over bigger losses than Barack Obama. In the eight years he's been in office, Democrats have lost so many seats at every level of government that they now have fewer elected officials nationwide than at any time since the 1920s. Not only are they in the minority in every branch of government in Washington, but beyond the beltway Democrats have a ""trifecta"" — control of both state houses and the governor's mansion — in only 6 states. Republicans have total control of state government in 25 states. Democrats are facing even more headwinds in 2018. The party in power usually loses seats in midterm elections, so Democrats should expect to pick up some seats. But while they may defeat a handful of Republicans in the House, the Senate map looks terrible for them — 25 Senate Democrats are up in 2018, and 10 of them are defending seats in states Donald Trump won. Republicans, on the other hand, have only eight senators up for reelection — mostly in safe red states. But there is a silver lining for Democrats, sort of. They have 48 seats in the Senate. They can still filibuster at least — unless Republicans change the rules altogether. Hillary Clinton also did win the popular vote by around 2.1 percentage points and almost 3 million votes. This election was not a repudiation of Democrats' ideology. Their base is the rising American electorate — young people, African-Americans, single women, Hispanics, all parts of the voting population that are growing. The Republican base is older, whiter, non-college educated, more rural — groups that are declining in relative numbers. Trump won by squeezing more out of a shrinking piece of the electoral pie. Democrats may be limping out of the 2016 election, but they have long-term advantages if they can figure out how to harness them. 2. First things first: Get a message on the economy. As Democrats form the circular firing squad that is the time-honored tradition of losing parties, they have many different scapegoats — James Comey? Vladimir Putin? Bernie Sanders? Bill Clinton and Loretta Lynch? Anthony Weiner? But most Democrats agree on one thing: They need an economic message. Hillary Clinton didn't have one. The Democrats' dilemma is sometimes described as a choice between appealing to their young, multicultural base or to white, working-class voters. But most Democrats believe that's a false choice. They need a message on the economy that cuts across class and racial lines, that can appeal to the young person saddled with college debt and the union worker (or former union worker) whose plant has moved to Mexico. Many Trump supporters were once Obama voters, and Democrats say they can win enough of those voters back if they focus their message on bread-and-butter issues. As one Democratic operative summed it up, ""More emphasis on jobs, less on transgender bathrooms."" Democrats need to develop their own nationalist economic message without the nativism. 3. Figure out how to resist Trump in Congress. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York have a choice — they can take a page out of Mitch McConnell's playbook and commit themselves to total obstruction. (The Senate Republicans' leader famously said in a 2010 National Journal interview, ""The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president."") Or they can pick and choose their fights, working with Trump where he supports their long-held goals — on a big infrastructure program, for instance. For now, Democratic congressional leaders seem to have settled on drawing a bright line of resistance when it comes to tax cuts for the rich or Medicare privatization. That kind of fight unites the Bernie Sanders-Elizabeth Warren wing of the party and red-state incumbents up for reelection like Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota. Right now, Democrats don't seem too worried about Obamacare. They're just sitting back and watching while Republicans try to figure out how to repeal it without forcing millions of people to lose their health insurance. Democrats are convinced the Republicans' strategy of ""repeal and delay"" (putting an ""expiration date"" on Obamacare of two or three years into the future to buy time for replacing it) won't work. And Democrats in the Senate need to prioritize their confirmation fights. That might mean energizing their base with a big fight against climate change skeptic Scott Pruitt for EPA, rather than Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson for secretary of state. And all along the way, Democrats will be trying to convince Trump's working-class supporters that they've been played — by an administration stocked with Wall Street bankers and plutocrats. 4. Rebuild your farm team. One of the consequences of losing big in the midterm elections of 2010 and 2014 is that the Democratic bench is decimated. Midterm elections are the time when the majority of elected offices in the country are filled. While Republicans are able to turn out their voters every two years, Democrats seem only able to turn out their voters every four. That needs to change. Democrats need to restock their pipeline with candidates for city council, mayor, state legislature and governor — and they need to do it all across the country. It's true that Democratic voters are inefficiently distributed geographically for the purposes of electing members of Congress or the Electoral College. Democrats' advantage in the national popular vote is just a consolation prize. There are too many Democratic voters massed together in urban areas on the East and West coasts. But as Obama said in his last press conference, the Democratic Party can't just be ""coastal, liberal, latte-sipping, politically correct, out-of-touch folks."" Obama has indicated that electing down-ballot Democrats will be a priority of his post-presidential years. (It's also something many Democrats think he neglected for the last eight years.) He will be working with Eric Holder, his former attorney general, on the National Democratic Redistricting Committee to help Democrats reverse their losses in the states. This is urgent if Democrats hope to have any say in how congressional and legislative district lines are drawn by governors and state legislatures after the next census in 2020. 5. Don't even think about the next presidential race. One of the big consequences of Hillary Clinton losing the 2016 election is that the Democratic Party has no natural national leaders after Obama leaves office next month. But that's OK. Right now, the party needs a message and a permanent infrastructure that can turn out its voters every two years — more than it needs a field of ready candidates to take on Trump in 2020.

npr,"December 26, 2016",Anti-Defamation League Chief Finds Trump Campaign Rhetoric Problematic," JONATHAN GREENBLATT: Do you believe Jews have controlled the media? Do you believe Jews have excessive power in finance? And there's a series of questions which were developed to identify whether or not someone holds anti-Semitic attitudes. GREENE: Greenblatt says fewer and fewer Americans hold such attitudes, but those who do are speaking more loudly. And throughout this election year, as we'll hear, Greenblatt has clashed with Republicans and Democrats. He critiqued a campaign ad for Donald Trump. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: It's a global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class. GREENE: In that ad, the talk of a global power structure is accompanied by images of financial leaders who happen to be Jewish. It was one of several times Trump was accused of winking at white supremacists. Yet Greenblatt knows some conservative Jews have sided with the president-elect, and he spoke about this with our colleague, Steve Inskeep. GREENBLATT: Donald Trump comes to the job with a more intimate relationship with the Jewish people than any of his predecessors. His business career took place here in New York City, working with lots of people in the Jewish community. His own son-in-law and daughter are observant Jews. This is an individual who understands the community. That's why we found it so deeply problematic when some of the images and some of the rhetoric seemed to evoke longstanding anti-Semitic conspiracies. STEVE INSKEEP, BYLINE: Is it possible it has been unconscious or unintended, then? GREENBLATT: Whether intentional or not, the use of this language is deeply problematic. INSKEEP: How did you come to get into a dispute, if that's the right word - a debate - with David Friedman, the man that President-Elect Trump has named as his proposed ambassador to Israel? GREENBLATT: Well, look, I don't think that I'm in a debate with David Friedman. I've never met David Friedman. I've never spoken to him before. I know that before he was named to this post, he said some things - let's just say, like, denigrating the ADL or likening other people in the Jewish community to Nazi collaborators. I think he said some things that were hardly diplomatic. INSKEEP: And he was also referring specifically to the Anti-Defamation League when you complained about the Trump ad which criticized a number of people who happened to be Jewish. He said that people like you sound like morons when you claim that's anti-Semitic. That's a quote. GREENBLATT: Yeah. Look, I mean, let me be clear. The ADL was founded over a hundred years ago, and we've been engaging with, you know, administrations since Woodrow Wilson. And during the course of that time, we're used to being attacked. So we are not going to stop, no matter what names we're called or whatever threats are leveled against us. INSKEEP: Is the Jewish community becoming more strictly divided, the way that many people feel the country as a whole is? GREENBLATT: I definitely think this trend of polarization is infecting the body politic broadly. I think you see signs of it in the Jewish community as well. Those of us who are proud to stand strong in the center have got our work to do to try to bridge that divide between right and left. INSKEEP: What are the issues that become flashpoints? I would imagine the particular brand of your support for Israel would be one thing. GREENBLATT: I think, yeah. But you know what? To be honest, Steve, Jews are the people who invented dissent, right? They have been engaged in commentary for millennia, so it really isn't a surprise that you have two Jews and you have three sets of opinions. INSKEEP: That's a stereotype you're happy to lean into, it sounds like. GREENBLATT: If you've ever been at the dinner table at my house, you'd know it's very true. INSKEEP: (Laughter) Well, let's talk about another story in which you have become involved. The Democrats are choosing the next leader of the Democratic Party. One of the candidates is Representative Keith Ellison of Minnesota, who is Muslim, by the way, who has also made a number of remarks about Israel that you found offensive. GREENBLATT: I don't know if I would characterize it like that. We did get involved with regard to Keith Ellison to speak out and express the fact that, while our offices worked with him on civil rights issues in the past, we had some questions about some of his recent votes and views about Israel. And we wanted to express those concerns. INSKEEP: There was a 2010 tape that surfaced - a recording. Ellison says, by the way, it was edited. But what he's heard saying on the tape is that U.S. policy is governed by what is good or bad through a country of 7 million people, suggesting that the U.S. is just thinking about Israel when it frame's policy in the Middle East, where there are hundreds of millions of other people. What's wrong with that statement? GREENBLATT: Well, look, I mean, I think, as we were talking about earlier, there are longstanding conspiracies about Jewish people, you know, controlling government or controlling finance or controlling the media. So we are constantly in a struggle to battle back against those bigoted ideas. What I found particularly difficult - and I think it is a disqualifying idea - if you believe that there's a Jewish conspiracy to control the U.S. government to serve our own interests. I think it's deeply troubling to consider that the leader of either political party would hold that kind of prejudiced idea. INSKEEP: Well, he has put out an open letter to you, as a matter of fact, in which he said, look, the tape was edited. That's not all I said. I was just answering a question. I was encouraging descendants of Arabs - other people from the Middle East besides Jews - to be involved politically in the United States, and that might change U.S. policy. That's what he says. Does that reassure you at all? GREENBLATT: I think the issue for me is, can you help confront these conspiracies and prove them wrong? And it's useful to say it in an open letter on Facebook, I suppose. It may be better to say it with your own voice in public. And so, look, I hope the congressman will do that. And I hope whoever is selected to run the Democratic Party, just like we would see on the GOP side, will have an open and inclusive view of America. INSKEEP: What are the deepest concerns that you hear from people as you do your job? GREENBLATT: The deepest concerns? Look, I'll tell you this. So when I was in high school, I did an interview with my grandfather for a school project. And he was a Holocaust survivor from Germany. And I asked him if, when he was a young man, he ever imagined that his grandchildren - me and my brother and my cousins - would be born in America. And my grandfather said to me in his very thick German accent, never. I've always imagined I would be in Germany. Where else would I be? So what I would say to you, Steve, is I don't think we can take for granted, considering the contemporary Jewish experience, that our grandchildren, my grandchildren will be born here in America unless we fight for what we have. INSKEEP: I want to make explicit what you're laying out there. You're suggesting a fear, a concern that there could be a day when Jews are unwelcome in America. GREENBLATT: What I'm suggesting is that, for over 2,000 years until the founding of the state of Israel in 1948, the Jewish people have lived in this constant dilemma where we have lived in societies but always been aware of the fact that there is some degree of risk.

npr,"December 26, 2016","Trump Made Many Promises For His First 100 Days, Will He Keep them?"," ROBERT COSTA: Good morning. GREENE: Could I start by asking you about the Republican National Committee's Christmas message, which has created a firestorm on social media? I just want to read from it here. Among the things it said is that this Christmas heralds a time to celebrate the good news of a new king. And many on social media reacted thinking that they were referring to Donald Trump. What do you make of this? COSTA: David, it was a firestorm on social media on Christmas Day, and there was also a microcosm of what we've seen happening in around the country, especially in places that the president-elect himself seems to inhabit, places like Twitter. So some Democrats and liberals thought this was absurd, that the RNC was in some way comparing Trump to Jesus Christ. And then you had the Republicans and their spokespeople fighting back and saying this was absurd from their perspective... GREENE: Saying that they were clearly referring to Jesus Christ and they were not making a Donald Trump reference was their argument. COSTA: Exactly. GREENE: Well, what - you say this speaks to something, a moment. I mean, are we going to see this time and time again potentially, that team Trump and, you know, what will be the White House doing something that many see as provocative and then critics, you know, saying this is outrageous and then Trump responding and saying, you know, everybody calm down, it's not that bad? COSTA: In the Trump era, it seems to happen almost every day. As a reporter for The Washington Post, we always seem to be covering this same dynamic, which is where the Trump allies and the Trump advisers and their supporters often say that something is being covered as too much about political correctness or it's being misinterpreted or Trump's misunderstood. And then Trump supporters say that the meaning is entirely different than how the critics are interpreting it. And it shows just how much our country is divided, not just in the politics but in how we see things. GREENE: Well, let's talk about the potential conflicts of interest that seems to be such a backdrop as Donald Trump will take office. The foundation that he has said that he is going to close - a lot of disagreement over how exactly he uses this foundation, right? COSTA: The Washington Post and my colleague who sits right next to me, David Fahrenthold, he's done extensive reporting on this. And Trump - the president-elect has chosen to close his foundation amid an investigation by the New York attorney general, Eric Schneiderman. And what happened is the New York attorney general decided to investigate the foundation because it had failed to register in the state. And Trump had - himself has not given a lot of money to his own foundation. He's often used donations to the foundation from other people to then give out those donations, so it's caused a lot of scrutiny and people to take a look at it over the past year. GREENE: So is this a big step towards dealing with conflict of interest questions? Because the Democratic Party - not that impressed, the party spokesman, Eric Walker, saying shuttering a charity is no substitute for divesting from his for-profit businesses. COSTA: It's a - it's something that's taken quite some time in this transition period. Trump and his family, they've been reluctant for some time to distance themselves from their charitable foundations, believing they were doing good works and that they could find some way once Trump entered the government to keep these foundations going, or at least keep the efforts going. But it's been found, many Trump people tell me, to be very difficult to keep these institutions moving forward. So you see Trump shuttering his foundation, closing it for the moment, same with Trump's son, Eric. GREENE: Lots of promises about what the first hundred days will be like, and, of course, incoming presidents always make a lot of promises. What do you see as topping the agenda as things get started? COSTA: It's not so much what Trump wants at this point, though that's important. It's also what Congress wants, and you have majorities in both chambers. And Paul Ryan, the House speaker, he's already outlining a program on tax reform, on rolling back the Affordable Care Act, on getting rid of regulations. And so as much as Trump ran as a populist and an outsider, much of his agenda for the moment is about what Republicans in Congress want to do on some of these core domestic issues. GREENE: You're saying that the party is really going to wield some power over Donald Trump in terms of where the agenda goes. COSTA: It certainly will. Trump, of course, has the nominations for his Cabinet. There will be a Supreme Court pick that Trump will nominate, and that will dominate much of 2017. But Trump himself, he ran mostly on immigration reform and tougher reforms on the border. The attorney general nominee, Jeff Sessions, the Alabama senator, he's planning to take a real role and try to limit legal immigration and build the wall that Trump has proposed. But on other issues, it's really Trump going along with the Congress. And the other front, though, that Trump is working on right now in the transition, of course, is foreign policy. And that's where Trump will have a major say. GREENE: OK. Robert Costa from The Washington Post, thanks as always, really appreciate it. COSTA: Thank you. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"December 26, 2016","Trump Aide Changes His Mind, Won't Serve As Communications Director"," Among them was Jason Miller who was named director of communications. But on Saturday, Miller issued a personal statement saying he wouldn't be joining the Trump team as announced — adding he wanted to spend more time with his family. Miller said the job would be too demanding and that his growing family was more important. He and his wife are expecting their second child next month. Sean Spicer, who last week was named White House press secretary, will take over the duties of communications director, Miller said in his statement. Spicer is a former spokesman for the Republican National Committee. Joining Spicer in the West Wing will be Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks, who will be director of strategic communications, and Dan Scavino, who will be director of social media. Both Hicks and Scavino had the same roles in Trump's presidential campaign. Also on Thursday, the Trump transition team announced the Kellyanne Conway will serve as counselor to the president. Conway was the third and final manager of the successful Trump campaign. She often served as an on-camera spokeswoman for Trump and is credited with bringing much-needed discipline to both the campaign's message and the candidate himself.

npr,"December 25, 2016",Gun Club For Liberals Says More People Are Joining Post-Election," According to the group's spokesperson, Lara Smith, The Liberal Gun Club has seen a big spike in inquiries since the election and a 10 percent bump in membership. Lara Smith joins us from El Cerrito, Calif., to talk about some of these figures. Hi there, Lara. LARA SMITH: Hi. Thank you for having me. AUBREY: So I want to begin by asking how The Liberal Gun Club is different from the NRA. SMITH: The NRA has its political side. We are an organization strictly for education. We do not endorse candidates. And we're a place - many of our members have joined NRA boards, other gun forums and found that they weren't welcome there because they didn't follow lockstep with the NRA's support of nearly unanimously Republican and right-leaning candidates. AUBREY: A lot of people may assume that liberal-leaning people are less likely to be gun enthusiasts. You're saying - and then the name of your club suggests - that this isn't necessarily so. SMITH: This isn't necessarily so. Even long before this election, approximately a quarter to a third of people who identified in surveys as Democrats also identified that there were firearms in their homes. Democrats have always been and always will be gun-owners. It's just a perception in the media - and, I think, in the party - that Democrats aren't interested in guns. AUBREY: Tell us what you have been seeing since last month's election. SMITH: We've seen significant more interest in our group. More women are joining, which is great. I actually run a women's shooting league here in the San Francisco Bay Area, about the most liberal area of the country you could find. And it's definitely picking up, although that's been true for a while. We are seeing more women concerned about protecting themselves, specifically about protecting themselves in their homes. The other group we are seeing more of - and I have to give a reason for that. There is a man named Maj Toure who has started a group called Black Guns Matter. And he has been going around to urban communities getting urban communities interested in their Second-Amendment rights. He's doing great work. We have seen some uptick from that as well. So yes, definitely people who are not the stereotypical middle-aged white male. AUBREY: So why now? What do you think? SMITH: I think, one, there's a very small subset who feel concerned about the new government. Specifically, is this new government going to take their guns because they've spoken out about an issue that Trump or the Republicans are seen as not supporting, whether it be LGBTQ rights, the environment, all sorts of issues. That's a small subset. More what we're seeing are people who are worried about their safety as a result of some of the rhetoric that was heard during the campaign - not so much from the campaign but from really fringe groups who have encouraged a rise in hate crimes or a perceived rise in hate crimes. AUBREY: Lara Smith is a spokesperson for The Liberal Gun Club. She joined us from El Cerrito, Calif. Thank you, Lara. SMITH: Thank you so much, Allison, for having me.

npr,"December 25, 2016",Examining The History Of The Trump Foundation After Trump Pledges To Dissolve It," David, thanks for joining us on Christmas Day. DAVID FAHRENTHOLD: Hey, no problem. AUBREY: So you've been looking into the foundation for quite some time. For people who haven't, give us a sense of what this foundation is all about and why it's causing the president-elect so many headaches. FAHRENTHOLD: Well, the Donald J. Trump Foundation has been around since the late '80s, which is sort of a foundation that's set up to give Trump's money away. But it's actually not that at all. For many of the recent years, between 2009 and 2015, it didn't actually get any money from Trump at all. Instead, he gave away other people's money to the people who thought they were getting Trump's money. AUBREY: So take us to yesterday. What's the news, and why is it significant? FAHRENTHOLD: Well, what happened yesterday was that Trump said, according to The New York Times - they reported it originally - that he was going to shut down this foundation. It's significant in that it's showing him, in a very small way, trying to get rid of some of the conflicts of interests and conduits for influence peddling which surround him. So he said he's shutting it down, but he can't actually shut it down, at least in a legal sense, because it's still under investigation by the New York attorney general. There are a number of things that the Trump Foundation needs to provide. One is it's currently been shut down for fundraising. It can't raise any money, so they're going to have to supply audits of past years, basically to tell New York AG - did they violate the law by spending money on things that benefited Trump himself? And also, they've said - without giving details - that in past years, they've violated these laws against what's called self-dealing, you know, buying things that benefit Trump or his businesses. So that has to happen, at least, before the investigation can end. AUBREY: And you've reported on some of these instances of self-dealing, instances in which Trump appeared to use the Trump Foundation's money to buy items for himself or to help one of his businesses. You mentioned the portraits. What are a few other examples? FAHRENTHOLD: Well, the portraits are two big examples. There was one he bought for $20,000, one he bought for $10,000. He also bought a Tim Tebow signed football helmet for $12,000 that we don't know where that is. But it belongs to Trump. These things - if the foundation buys them, he has to use them for a charitable purpose. So we're trying to think of - what could be a charitable purpose for a giant picture of himself or a Tim Tebow helmet? The big-ticket items, ones that really stand out, are these two payments, one for $100,000, one for $158,000 where, basically, his clubs had gotten into legal trouble. And as a condition of settling their lawsuits, the business has said - OK, I'm going to donate money to a particular charity. Is what Trump did was take the money out of his charity, the Trump Foundation, and use it to pay off those obligations that his businesses had incurred? AUBREY: Right. And you've mentioned that this is problematic because the money his foundation is using is not coming from him. It's coming from other people, other donations. FAHRENTHOLD: Right. And also, once money goes into a charity, it is tax exempt, so that's a benefit you get. And in return, you have to use the assets of the charity to serve the public good. So if Trump is using this money basically to save his businesses, the money isn't helping people. That's a violation of the letter and the spirit of law. AUBREY: What should we be watching for going forward? Are there other legal issues that might pop up? FAHRENTHOLD: Well, with the foundation specifically, we should be watching the New York attorney general to see what they find and what sort of penalties they impose. The other thing will be, all of Trump's businesses - his hotel businesses, his buildings overseas - those things are far more complicated. And they are potentially far more problematic for him when he becomes president. AUBREY: David Fahrenthold is a reporter for The Washington Post. He was kind enough to join us from Aruba on this Christmas Day. I wish I were there. David, thanks so much for joining us. FAHRENTHOLD: Thank you. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"December 25, 2016","After Ignoring Evangelical Voters In 2016, How Democrats Can 'Reclaim Hope'"," Thank you for joining us today, Michael. MICHAEL WEAR: Thank you. It's great to be here with you. CHANG: Let's talk about some of the issues that drove that enormous support from evangelicals. For instance, how important was the Supreme Court vacancy? WEAR: It was very important. The most - the wisest political move that Donald Trump made was to release that list of potential Supreme Court nominations, which were vetted, conservative nominees... CHANG: All pro-life. WEAR: All pro-life. When I'd be talking with evangelicals, they'd say - look, we know that Donald Trump is not a good man. But we have a Supreme Court vacancy right now (laughter), and we could see, potentially, three to four in the next four to eight years. And so risking a Hillary Clinton presidency for some of those folks was not an option. CHANG: So abortion, same-sex marriage - any other issues that drove so much evangelical support? WEAR: It's been interesting. The liberals spent a lot of time over the last several decades, particularly during the Bush years, trying to convince Christians that we were not a Christian nation. And to some extent, the election of Donald Trump and the evangelical support of Donald Trump was their embracing that we aren't a Christian nation. It was their embracing of the fact that they weren't going to be able to get everything they wanted in a presidential candidate anymore - a sort of faithful, church-going, decent (laughter) man. It was a political sort of power move. And so yes, there were concrete issues - abortion, gay marriage, religious freedom, religious liberty - played a big role. But it was also a very culturally divisive and culturally motivated vote. CHANG: A Columbia professor, Mark Lilla, wrote a critique of American liberalism in The New York Times. And one of the things he said is that liberalism has fostered a kind of condescension towards evangelicals. First of all, does he have a point? WEAR: He does have a point. And it's something that the Democratic Party has always wrestled with. And as a Democrat, it seems like it's a lesson we need to keep learning every time we lose. And when we win a couple of times we think - oh, well, we don't need those voters anymore. And it takes a loss for us to ask the questions when we should just learn the lesson and keep on implementing the lesson that we can't write off large sections of the American electorate. And I think that was a large part of what Lilla was speaking to. CHANG: Do you feel any personal responsibility, since you were in the Obama White House, for this perception that many evangelicals feel they don't fit into the Democratic Party? WEAR: Well, I think we did a lot of work to try and reverse that notion. I mean, again, it was Senator Obama who had a vibrant, extensive faith outreach during both of his presidential campaigns. What was disheartening was to see, in 2016, the Democrats sort of reject that aspect of the president's legacy and sort of reject his willingness to reach out to not just evangelicals but Catholics. I mean, remember President Obama won Catholics in both 2008 and 2012, and Hillary Clinton lost them. And working-class Catholics used to be part of the Clinton base. CHANG: What did her campaign do wrong that led to that rejection? WEAR: Well, they did nothing. That's the first thing to say is that they did literally nothing. They didn't bring on a faith outreach adviser until this summer, which is political malpractice. CHANG: So what do Democrats do to re-engage evangelical Christians who feel that they've been excluded from Democratic Party priorities? WEAR: Yeah. Well, liberals and some Democrats get a little nervous when you talk about this 'cause they think that it's about caving on principles. And so the first level is not about caving on principles at all. It's about simply engaging these voters and not dismissing their perspective or ignoring their perspective out of hand. And so the traditional Democratic answer on an issue like life, for instance, over the last 20, 30 years has been that it should be safe, legal and rare and that Democrats support the legality of abortion but they want to seek ways to reduce it. They don't think that it's a moral good. And in 2016, for the first time ever, the Democratic Party platform supported the repeal of the Hyde Amendment, which would allow federal funding for abortion - first time in 40 years. It was amazing. Two weeks before the election, you saw House Democrats tweeting be bold, end Hyde. That was our closing message in this election campaign, was ending the Hyde Amendment, which is not exactly hitting the Rust Belt. And so... CHANG: And what message did that send to evangelical Christians? WEAR: Well, it didn't - it sent the message that we don't have a message for them - that we don't care and that if they lost, they had everything to lose, when we actually do have a message to these voters. We have a message on immigration reform. We have a message on poverty. We have a message on supporting international development. But when Democrats assume things about these voters and what motivates them, it's no surprise that we only get 16 percent. CHANG: How do you see the religious outreach office changing under a President Trump? WEAR: If Donald Trump thinks that the faith-based office is just one more platform to sort of mobilize religious voices to support whatever he happens to be doing at the time and sort of as a platform for religious hucksterism, then I have deep concerns. I've spent the last decade of my life arguing for the importance of the faith-based office. And Donald Trump is going to challenge all of my arguments. And my hope and prayer is that he keeps the office focused on serving the vulnerable, providing resources to the faith community to do what they do best. CHANG: Michael Wear is a political strategist who specialized in religious affairs. He worked in the Obama administration, where he led evangelical outreach. Thanks for joining us, Michael.

npr,"December 24, 2016",Trump Plans To Dissolve His Foundation; N.Y. Attorney General Pushes Back," Updated Dec. 25 at 3:53 pm E.T. President-elect Donald Trump plans to dissolve his foundation, his transition team announced on in statement on Saturday. Soon after, though, the New York attorney general's spokesperson tweeted that he legally can't, until the state's investigation of the Trump Foundation is complete. .@Fahrenthold @realDonaldTrump Foundation still under investigation by @AGSchneiderman, cannot legally dissolve until investigation complete Press Secretary Amy Spitalnick was responding to Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold, who asked if the investigation would continue. In October, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman ordered the foundation to stop raising money in New York, saying the charity was not registered to do so under state law. In Saturday's statement, Trump is quoted as saying: ""The Foundation has done enormous good works over the years in contributing millions of dollars to countless worthy groups, including supporting veterans, law enforcement officers and children. However, to avoid even the appearance of any conflict with my role as President I have decided to continue to pursue my strong interest in philanthropy in other ways."" The announcement comes shortly after a report from The New York Times discussing the president-elect's many potential conflicts of interest. The Times reports that Trump and his family ""are rushing to resolve potential controversies — like shuttering foundations and terminating development deals — even as the president-elect publicly maintains that no legal conflicts exist."" An NPR report from earlier this year compared the work of the Trump Foundation with that of the Clinton Foundation, which came under fire during the campaign, noting the similarities seem to end with their names. As NPR's Joel Rose reported, ""The Bill, Hillary &amp; Chelsea Clinton Foundation, as it's formally known, is huge. It has hundreds of employees and a $90 million budget. The Donald J. Trump Foundation, by contrast, is fairly small. It has no full-time employees and a budget of about $600,000."" In an interview with NPR's Allison Aubrey Sunday, Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold provided context. ""The Donald J. Trump Foundation has been around since the late '80s, and on paper it sort of looks like what a lot of other rich people have, which is a foundation that's set up to give Trump's money away. But it's actually not that at all — for many of the recent years between 2009 and 2015, it didn't actually get any money from Trump at all — instead he gave away other people's money kind of under his own name, to people that thought they were getting Trump's money. He also used it to apparently violate the law in a number of ways — he used it to buy big portraits of himself including one that hangs on the wall of a sports bar he owns, and he used it to pay off debts or obligations that his businesses have incurred. So he was already under investigation by the New York Attorney General for apparently violating a number of federal laws that govern charities."" David Fahrenthold's reporting in the Post has shown that Trump hasn't given any of his own money to the foundation since 2008. The Post says Vince and Linda McMahon, owners of World Wrestling Entertainment, have been major donors; Trump recently nominated Linda McMahon to head the Small Business Administration.

npr,"December 24, 2016",U.N. Rejects U.S. Calls For Sanctions On South Sudan," U.N. officials have been sounding the alarms about the possibility of a genocide in South Sudan. A civil war broke out in the country in 2013, just two years after it became an independent country. Now rape and killings are widespread. But yesterday, the U.N. Security Council rejected U.S. calls for an arms embargo and sanctions on the parties at war. NPR's Michele Kelemen reports. MICHELE KELEMEN, BYLINE: The U.S. ambassador to the U.N., Samantha Power, won a Pulitzer Prize for writing a book about genocide prevention. And as U.N. officials started sounding the alarms about South Sudan, she tried to persuade her fellow Security Council members to at least stem the flow of weapons to South Sudan and punish those responsible on both sides for stoking ethnic violence. SAMANTHA POWER: They came here and their - the lights flashed red. That doesn't happen in this council very often, where you get just a string of U.N. officials coming and describing the gravity of what lies ahead. KELEMEN: But even as U.N. officials reported widespread rape and ethnic cleansing, Power was unable to get enough support in the Security Council on Friday. Her draft resolution failed with more abstentions than yes votes. POWER: The council members who didn't support this resolution are taking a big gamble that South Sudan's leaders will not instigate a catastrophe. If those council members are wrong - and every report we have heard in this chamber suggests that they are - it is the people of South Sudan who will pay an unbearable price. KELEMEN: Russia abstained, and its ambassador accused Power of, quote, ""high-handed conduct"" in the council. China also abstained, pointing out that South Sudan's president has announced plans for a national dialogue. Even Japan, a key U.S. ally, abstained from the vote. Japan has peacekeepers in South Sudan and argues that sanctions could be counterproductive. British Ambassador Matthew Rycroft says South Sudan's government may be saying positive things now, but the reality looks different as authorities kick out aid workers and restrict U.N. peacekeepers. MATTHEW RYCROFT: In reality, the U.N.'s mission continues to face chronic restrictions. In reality, the humanitarian situation has got worse - not better - and people are suffering. In reality, they are voting with their feet. Up to 6,000 of them per day fled for Uganda this month. KELEMEN: Western diplomats are now appealing to those who abstained from the vote Friday to come up with something better. Michele Kelemen, NPR News, Washington. Copyright © 2016 NPR.

npr,"December 24, 2016",Analyzing The Impact Of The U.N. Resolution On Israeli Settlements," We wanted to know more about this so we're joined now by Ambassador Dennis Ross. He helped mediate the Israeli-Palestinian conflict during the Clinton administration. He's currently a distinguished fellow at The Washington Institute. That's a foundation looking at U.S. interests in the Middle East. He joins us via Skype from Tel Aviv. Ambassador Ross, thanks for joining us. DENNIS ROSS: Thank you. AUBREY: So first off today, the U.S. abstained from the vote that basically allowed this new resolution to pass that condemns Israeli settlements. What is the likely impact of this, or is it mainly symbolic? ROSS: Well, I suspect it's more symbolic than anything else. And the reason I say that is that it's hard for it to really constitute some kind of precedent. So if the next president is going to adopt a different posture, if this really isn't laying a predicate for sanctions, it's difficult to see how it really represents something that is substantive. I suspect it really is much more of a symbol than anything else. AUBREY: Now, there's been tension between the Obama administration and Prime Minister Netanyahu's government for, you know, some time now over the issue of settlements as well as the Iran nuclear deal. What is the response from Israel and from the Palestinians? ROSS: Well, you know, the response from the Israelis has been a very tough one. They see this as the U.S. not standing by Israel, not maintaining what has been a traditional posture. For the Palestinians who've been trying hard to internationalize the conflict, this is very much where they would like to see the focal point of activities. Even if it's symbolic, from their standpoint, it's a statement on the world stage. And for Palestinians, generally, the one place they feel they get a kind of broader understanding is on the world stage. AUBREY: It's interesting to note that there was applause in the chamber. Applause broke out following the vote, and the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., Samantha Power, made the case that the vote was consistent with a bipartisan consensus that she said goes back to Ronald Reagan. What's the point she was trying to make here? What does she mean? ROSS: Well, I think what she was trying to say is that American policy on Israeli settlement activity has been consistent, at least in the sense that every administration has seen it as an obstacle to peace. The truth is every administration since Jimmy Carter's has viewed it as a political issue, not a legal issue. This was the first time that the Obama administration had actually allowed such a resolution to go through. AUBREY: You've already mentioned that President-elect Trump is not happy about the decision. He tweeted, things will be different after January 20. And Republican Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina is saying that the U.S. should pull funding from the U.N. What do you think we can expect going forward? ROSS: Well, I do think that the - in the near term, there's going to be a kind of reaction, or even a kind of backlash, along the lines that you saw, meaning that I think there'll be a real hesitancy to use the U.N. as a forum when it relates to the Israeli-Palestinian issue. We'll certainly see that in the early stages of the Trump administration. What we don't know is - is the Trump administration going to engage in any kind of consistent approach to Israeli-Palestinian diplomacy? AUBREY: All right, so something to keep watching. Ambassador Dennis Ross is a distinguished fellow at The Washington Institute. He joined us from Tel Aviv in Israel. Ambassador Ross, thanks so much for joining us. ROSS: My pleasure.

npr,"December 24, 2016","Congressman Charles Rangel, Harlem's Face In Washington, Retires"," There's a changing of the guard in Harlem. When the new Congress is seated in January, it will mark the first time since the second world war that the New York neighborhood is not represented by an African-American. For some residents, that adds to a growing sense of anxiety about changes underway, as NPR's Joel Rose reports. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: If you want to see the past and future of Harlem, look at the corner of 125th Street and Lenox Avenue, also known as Malcolm X Boulevard. On one side of the street, a towering metal and glass box where a Whole Foods Market will open next year. And on the other side, a two-story building with a crumbling Art Deco facade that used to be a jazz club called the Lenox Lounge. MICHAEL HENRY ADAMS: This building is a place where Billie Holiday performed and where great bebop artists made their reputations. ROSE: Michael Henry Adams is an historian of Harlem who's trying to preserve the neighborhood's distinctive architecture. He says the Lenox Lounge will be the next casualty. ADAMS: It'll be demolished and replaced by this five-story structure that will not reflect anything that was here. And that is what hurts my soul so much. ROSE: Harlem was once the undisputed cultural capital of black America. It was an important bastion of African-American political power, too. Now census data suggests that it's not even a majority-black neighborhood. Since the turn of the century, there's been an influx of whites and a growing Latino population. And longtime residents like Valerie Jo Bradley worry about what that means for the neighborhood. VALERIE JO BRADLEY: When I got my house in Harlem, there were no construction loans or mortgages. ROSE: Bradley runs a bed and breakfast in the elegant brownstone townhouse she bought with cash in the early 1980s when Harlem was represented in Congress by Charlie Rangel. But Rangel is retiring after more than four decades. And Bradley says there's some concern about his successor, who will be sworn in next month. BRADLEY: There is a fear that Harlem's going to be ignored by this congressman. But I would feel that that's impossible. ROSE: The new congressman-elect is Adriano Espaillat, who will be the first Dominican-American to serve in Congress. ADRIANO ESPAILLAT: I am a Dominican of African descent. There is no difference between myself and folks from Harlem. ROSE: Espaillat won a contested Democratic primary in the spring after losing to Charlie Rangel twice before. Espaillat's political base is Latino voters in Washington Heights, which he represented in Albany. But he insists Harlem residents will like him too once they get to know him better. ESPAILLAT: People will see as I establish myself there, and my office will be open right there in the state office building, that I will represent every district with no privilege of one district over the other. ROSE: Concerns about gentrification in Harlem are not new, but the pace of change may be accelerating as wealthier residents move in and attract businesses that cater to them. Jeff Green owns a cafe on 129th Street called Lenox Coffee. He's also a realtor in the neighborhood. JEFF GREEN: People are moving up here because they really like the way Harlem is. And the dynamic at this cafe is very diverse and people from old Harlem and new Harlem. ROSE: You can find similar racial diversity in the growing number of restaurants and cafes that have opened on Lenox Avenue. Historian Michael Henry Adams acknowledges that gentrification has some benefits. ADAMS: Harlem has become this highly cosmopolitan place with people who have moved here who formerly lived in Paris or all over. We all love the old buildings. We all love the heritage here. But for many of us, we can sense that our days are numbered. ROSE: Adams fears that Harlem's future doesn't have room for the history and the people who put the neighborhood on the map.

npr,"December 24, 2016",Democrats Take Opposition Fight To The States," NICK RATHOD: Thank you for having me. WERTHEIMER: Now, in American politics, I think we tend to think of conservatives as pushing for reforms in state legislatures, trying to, you know, act locally and liberals working in Washington on federal regulations because that's a bigger picture. You're hoping to back that federal effort up and start over. Is that what you're doing? RATHOD: Yeah. Our theory of change is to flip that on its head for progressives. So conservatives have traditionally had this view that they want to build and invest and focus at the state level where progressives and Democrats have really centralized and tried try to build their power in Washington, D.C. And I think that that theory has had negative implications for and negative consequences for Democrats and progressives across the country. WERTHEIMER: So if you're going to go to work in the states, what states? RATHOD: We actually have a 50-state view on this. Our group does not think that you can just write off whole swaths of the country. You look now after the election, Kentucky, the House there lost Democratic control. And after that, we no longer, as progressives, have one state legislative chamber in the entire South. You can probably count on one hand the number of state-level elected officials in the entire South. And that's because of neglect, and it's not that progressive ideas can't flourish there. It's not that there's progressive-minded people there. It's just that we've ignored it and that I think that it's time to refocus and rebuild in every state across the country. WERTHEIMER: So I guess you really have no choice but to go to work with red state legislatures in the southern states. What would you do in that sort of setting? RATHOD: Let's have some debates about policies and see where things shake out. I think one of the things that progressives have done back to the theory is that we try to pass big pieces of legislation here in D.C. and then educate everyone on the back end where conservatives have developed policies that are tailored to local communities and then have the conversation and build narratives around what that means for people. I mean, I grew up in Nebraska, and when I talk with my conservative friends there, we're pretty close on a lot of the issues. But the thing is that we just haven't ever really sat down and talked to people about what it - what equal pay actually means. You know, do you care whether your daughter gets paid the same as your son? I think most people would say yeah. Do you care that people have a living wage, that people who are playing by the rules, working hard, I think people would say yes to that. Let's have those conversations locally, and let's shake out who is actually fighting for those things. WERTHEIMER: This sounds very long term to me. RATHOD: (Laughter) You know, it is a long-term play. If you look at - conservatives have been investing in this strategy really for about 40 years. And they now bear the fruits of that. And, you know, I think we can win on some things in the short term, but if you want to actually build power, sustain power, I think it is a long-term view that you have to take. WERTHEIMER: Nick Rathod is executive director of the State Innovation Exchange. Thank you very much. RATHOD: Thank you for having me. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"December 24, 2016",Cautious Trump Voter And Radio Host Ed Morrisey Is Optimistic After Cabinet Picks," ED MORRISSEY: Great to be with you, thank you. WERTHEIMER: When you see Donald Trump wading into big-policy questions like nuclear weapons, do you take him seriously or do you think he's putting on some kind of a little play with some other diplomatic or political gain in mind? MORRISSEY: Well, I mean, I would take either one of those options seriously. He's the president of the United States, and so I think it automatically becomes serious when you have the president-elect of the United States, I should say, talking about nuclear weapons and our nuclear strategy. And I think that like we have seen in other areas, you know, Twitter is not necessarily the greatest platform in which to articulate a nuanced and in-depth strategy on much of anything. And I would say nuclear weapons probably is one of the bigger examples of what doesn't fit in Twitter. WERTHEIMER: Well, now, over the past few weeks, after learning about Russian hacking during the election, a split seems to be developing in your party over how to think about Russia. Donald Trump calls for a more friendly relationship. This is obviously a big move away from President Ronald Reagan's evil empire. Is that a problem for you or not? MORRISSEY: It's a bit of a problem for me because I think Russia is malicious actor on the world stage. I do think, though, that the national security team that Donald Trump is putting together probably has some clear eyes on that. And I think that you'll find that the practical strategy coming out of the White House during the Trump era might be a little less pro-Russian than perhaps some people are assuming. WERTHEIMER: When Scott Simon talked to you over the summer, you were struggling with who you would support. You said you were not a Never Trump person, but you had doubts about Donald Trump. How are you feeling now, especially considering what you just said about about Russia? MORRISSEY: Well, I mean, I think I still have some skepticism about Donald Trump. What I'm hoping for is that we start to rethink the presidency itself in terms of the amount of authority that we have allowed the executive to accrue and have some of that come back to Congress and to the states in order to make the question of what a president is going to do at least a little bit more controllable. WERTHEIMER: Well, now, I would think that that would be something that Donald Trump would not really want to get behind. MORRISSEY: Probably not. The problem is is that most people who run for president will talk about that, but when they get into office, their incentives change. And I think one thing that we can probably look forward to is the fact that because Donald Trump is coming in as a less popular president-elect than probably we've seen in quite a long period of time - maybe Nixon would be the closest analog to this - there's going to be a lot more incentives for Congress and for the states to assert more of their own jurisdiction. And I think that that would be a positive outcome. WERTHEIMER: You talked about the Cabinet briefly. Are there any Cabinet choices so far that you feel strongly about one way or the other? MORRISSEY: Well, I feel pretty good about most of them. The one question mark I probably have is Tillerson at state because I think that the fact that he's done a lot of business with the Putin administration in Russia certainly is something that I think Congress is going to be asking a lot of questions about. But I think conservatives can be pretty cheered by some of the other picks in some of the other Cabinet positions, such as Governor Rick Perry at energy and Scott Pruitt at the EPA are definitely going to be pursuing the type of devolution of authority back to the states that I think that conservatives have been asking for really probably for 20-30 years and haven't seen much of. WERTHEIMER: Ed Morrissey is host of ""The Ed Morrissey Show"" on Hot Air and the author of the book ""Going Red."" He joined us via Skype. Thank you very much for doing this.

npr,"December 24, 2016","White House Sharpens Its Case For Obamacare, As Republicans Sharpen Knives"," The Affordable Care Act is on the chopping block, likely to be one of the first casualties when President-elect Donald Trump takes office next month. ""We will repeal the disaster known as 'Obamacare' and create new health care — all sorts of reforms that work for you and your family,"" Trump promised in Florida last week. Before that happens, President Obama and his aides want to put a marker down on what they see as the law's accomplishments over the last six years. ""When I came into office, 44 million people were uninsured,"" Obama told reporters during his pre-Christmas news conference at the White House. ""Today, we've covered more than 20 million of them. For the first time in our history, more than 90 percent of Americans are insured."" So far, more than 6.4 million people have signed up for insurance coverage in 2017 through the federal exchange. Enrollments are on track to exceed last year's total, with many coming from states like Florida, Texas, and North Carolina that were carried by Trump. While expanded insurance coverage is the yardstick most often cited, defenders argue the Affordable Care Act has also helped limit rising health care costs and put more emphasis on the quality of care, not just how much is done. ""While multiple factors are likely playing a role, payment reforms introduced in the [Affordable Care Act] have made substantial, quantifiable contributions to slowing the growth of health care costs in both Medicare and private insurance,"" White House economists wrote in a report this month. The report cites estimates from the Congressional Budget Office that Obamacare has shaved 1.3 percentage points off the annual growth in per-person Medicare spending. For people who get health coverage through their employer, the slowdown has been even sharper, the report says. The cost of family coverage has grown just over 3 percent per year since the Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010. That's a 45 percent reduction from the pace of the previous six years. While many workplace insurance plans now include higher deductibles and co-pays, workers' out-of-pocket costs are still growing more slowly than they were before Obamacare, White House economists say. The law also encourages payment reforms that reward doctors and hospitals for high-quality care, not simply performing a lot of tests and procedures. More than 30 percent of Medicare payments are now based on these ""alternative payment models,"" along with about 10 percent of payments for workers covered by private insurance. To be sure, the Affordable Care Act remains deeply controversial. Americans who dislike the law slightly outnumber those who approve of it. That's partly a reflection of the law's partisan history. It was passed without a single Republican vote. Implementation has also been rocky — especially the disastrous debut of the government's insurance exchange website in 2013. Nineteen states — most with Republican leadership — declined to take advantage of the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion. What's more, after losing money in past years, many insurance companies have stopped offering policies on the government-run exchanges. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, about 20 percent of people shopping for coverage on the exchanges this year have just one insurance company to choose from. With less competition, premiums on the exchanges have risen sharply: about 25 percent on average. Despite these drawbacks, supporters say the Affordable Care Act has been a net-plus, both for individual customers who can no longer be denied access to health insurance and for the federal government which has steadily reduced its forecast of long-term health-care costs. At the same time, the law has not proven to be the drag on job growth that many Republicans warned of. ""Since I signed Obamacare into law, our businesses have added more than 15 million new jobs,"" Obama noted. The president can point to a number of other positive indicators as he prepares to leave office, including long-awaited wage gains in the last year and a modest decrease in income inequality, stemming, in part, from higher taxes on the wealthy. The president and his team are trying to document those gains, mindful that the next occupant of the White House wants to reverse much of what Obama has put in place. ""What the president-elect is going to be doing is going to be very different than what I was doing, and I think people will be able to compare and contrast and make judgments about what worked for the American people,"" Obama said during his year-end news conference. ""I hope that, building off the progress we've made, that what the president-elect is proposing works. What I can say with confidence is that what we've done works.""

npr,"December 23, 2016","Following Negotiations, No Rockettes Will Be Required To Perform At Inauguration"," At least some of the dance group didn't want to perform for the incoming president's celebration, but a string of messages between dancers, their union and the troupe's ownership group over the latter part of the week caused confusion for many. Ultimately, dancers will now be able to individually choose whether or not to perform on Inauguration Day. Let's break it down: The latest Late Friday, following negotiations with the Rockettes owner, the Madison Square Garden Co., and the performers' union, The American Guild of Variety Artists (AGVA), announced on Facebook that no Rockettes would be obligated to perform. ""Fortunately, the Company has agreed that ALL participation in this particular event will be voluntary. We are greatly relieved and hope to work with our Members to inform them and alleviate the anxiety and fears that this has caused."" How we got here: Thursday Donald Trump's transition-team and the Madison Square Garden Co. confirmed that the Rockettes would perform at the president-elect's inauguration next month. Almost immediately, the Rockettes were coming under criticism on social media — including from one Rockette herself. In a since deleted post on Instagram, dancer Phoebe Pearl said she was ""embarrassed and disappointed"" to learn of the decision. ""The women I work with are intelligent and are full of love,"" Pearl wrote. ""The decision of performing for a man that stands for everything we're against is appalling."" She added, ""We have been performing with tears in our eyes and heavy hearts,"" with the hashtag #notmypresident. Thursday night Any talk of boycotting the performance seemed to be quashed by the Rockettes' union — the American Guild of Variety Artists (AGVA). In an email obtained and published by Broadwayworld.com, a union representative wrote that ""Everyone is entitled to her own political beliefs, but there is no room for this in the workplace."" The letter noted that dancers who are not full time did not have to sign up to perform, but ""if you are fulltime, you are obligated."" The story was widely circulated by news outlets, including CNBC, Rolling Stone, the BBC, and NPR. Friday The Madison Square Garden Co. released a statement stating that all performances were voluntary: ""The Radio City Rockettes are proud to participate in the 58th Presidential Inaugural. For a Rockette to be considered for an event, they must voluntarily sign up and are never told they have to perform at a particular event, including the inaugural. It is always their choice. In fact, for the coming inauguration, we had more Rockettes request to participate than we have slots available. We eagerly await the inaugural celebrations."" In a post on the AGVA's Facebook page, the union stated that following a meeting, the Madison Square Garden Co. had agreed that all participation would be voluntary (though the MSG Co. seems to be saying that was the case all along.) The AGVA also clarified the language of their Thursday email, stating: The Union never ""demanded"" that the Rockettes perform at the inauguration. A message was sent to the Rockettes last evening that stated the terms of their contract. There is a small group of year round Rockettes who are contractually obligated to perform at scheduled events throughout the year. We are pleased that Radio City has agreed that for those Rockettes with year-round employment, participation in this event will be voluntary as well. College dance team faces similar backlash So, it seems that Rockettes who don't want to participate are off the hook. But the dance troupe is not the only group coming under fire for being involved in the inauguration celebrations. The Austin American-Statesman reported Thursday that Texas State University's dance team, The Strutters, had shut down its Twitter account following harsh criticism for agreeing to participate. It remained deleted as of midday Saturday. Thoughts were mixed on the group's announcement on Facebook. Several major acts, including Elton John, Garth Brooks, Celine Dion and Idina Menzel, have reportedly refused to participate in the inauguration celebrations. In response to a question from Vanity Fair about Trump's difficulty locking down performers, Menzel said, ""It's karma, baby.""

npr,"December 23, 2016","Week In Politics: U.N. Condemns Israeli Settlements, Trump On Nuclear Weapons"," E J DIONNE, BYLINE: Good to be with you. SHAPIRO: And so is David Brooks of The New York Times. Hey, David. DAVID BROOKS, BYLINE: Hi, how are you? SHAPIRO: I'm fine. So head-scratching, imminent annihilation - what do you make of these statements about nuclear weapons from President-elect Trump, E.J.? DIONNE: I hope in a couple years someone doesn't have an occasion to write a bestseller called tweeting to Armageddon. I mean, this is a crazy way to do nuclear policy. And not only that, you have a trumpet operation there where you've got Trump tweeting this, then his office, his press office, sort of says, no, no, no, he really meant exactly the opposite of what he said... SHAPIRO: That was Kellyanne Conway last night with Rachel Maddow, yeah. DIONNE: Right. And then he makes policy with a call to Mika Brzezinski on ""Morning Joe"" saying no, he really meant this. And I don't know what he is up to. I'm not sure he knows what he is up to. And it's just no way to deal with some of the most dangerous weapons that have ever existed. SHAPIRO: David Brooks, I could imagine Trump saying being unpredictable is a good thing. Our adversaries don't know where we're going to go next. BROOKS: Yeah, that's the crazy man theory. It's a risky one. It may pay off. I'm just struck by - it's an - we're in a new world of even punditry because usually when we analyze the president-elect, even a candidate or a president, there's a process. When they say something, there's been a process, there's been words, there have been arguments, there have been memos. And there's some contact with reality. These are more like emotional effusions. And so we're going to learn how much - how to - how much to take this literally. And I think the effect - if it is unliteral (ph), if there's this huge gap between whatever he says and any reality or any thought, then the effect is likely to be A, sort of powerlessness because it never will actually touch the ground, but also greater erraticness (ph). And it could go in both directions simultaneously. SHAPIRO: There is this pattern, E.J., as you point out, where Donald Trump will often say or tweet something surprising, his advisers will say you're misinterpreting him, and then Trump will come back and say, no, don't listen to my team. The only quote that matters is a quote from me. Newt Gingrich experienced this this week. He told Morning Edition that Donald Trump doesn't say drain the swamp anymore. Then Trump tweeted, someone incorrectly stated that the phrase drain the swamp was no longer being used by me. Actually, we will always be trying to DTS. And then Gingrich posted a video. Let's listen to a clip of it. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NEWT GINGRICH: I want to report that I made a big boo-boo. I talked this morning with President-elect Donald Trump, and he reminded me he likes draining the swamp. I blew that one. Draining the swamp is in. President-elect Trump wants to do it, and you're going to get to be part of it. SHAPIRO: A big boo-boo. David, how will these mixed messages actually work in the process of running a huge federal bureaucracy? BROOKS: I should point out we're sitting in the swamp. We're right here. We're getting - about to be drained. SHAPIRO: The alligators. BROOKS: But again, this is about words. This - Trump cares a lot about words and the words that go out. And so there's this realm of reality which is just marketing and words, and then there's the realm of reality of actually governing. And even though some of us are afraid that he'll be a very authoritarian leader and do a lot of very strong things, I can easily paint a scenario where he's a very feckless leader and he sits in the cloud of words and the agencies of government who are career staff, they just go along their merry way and nothing actually settles into their world, the world of actual reality. DIONNE: Maybe we'll... SHAPIRO: E.J. - I mean, we haven't actually seen Trump governing yet, right? So this is still speculation. DIONNE: Well, it's - but you thought that Trump might make a transition to something different, and he clearly has. And we could, David, end up with the worst of both worlds, a feckless authoritarian, which would not be very good for us. There is something appalling about how Trump loyalists have to grovel when their leader reproaches them. That Gingrich line was just sort of - it went right through you given how strong Gingrich's views are. But Gingrich's statement was actually a classic case of the Mike Kinsley rule that a gaffe is when someone tells the truth. Far from draining the swamp, it looks like he's going to expand the swamp. You know, we heard not only is he not going to follow traditional conflict-of-interest rules, not only is he not releasing his tax returns, the Senate Republicans said they're not going to ask for Rex Tillerson's tax returns. The Democrats are saying they want them. And so there really is - words mean whatever Donald Trump wants them to mean. And it's hard to see how any of these actions is going to drain any swamp. BROOKS: One nice thing - I have to say one nice thing about Trump, which is that he is a New Yorker, which means he's willing to tolerate dissent. And he's willing to smack people down in public, even giving Kellyanne Conway the job - communications job, which she got this week after the public dissing of Mitt Romney in the... SHAPIRO: Oh, for the secretary of state? BROOKS: Yeah. SHAPIRO: Wait, but is he tolerating dissent... DIONNE: Although she won... SHAPIRO: ...When he contradicts Kellyanne Conway, contradicts Newt Gingrich? Newt Gingrich makes his public statements... BROOKS: But then he still hired her. I think he's used to arguing with people in public and not holding it. So he's not cutting them off, which I ascribe to one virtue of being a New Yorker. (LAUGHTER) SHAPIRO: I chuckle over my fellow New Yorker, Robert Siegel, in the adjacent chair. DIONNE: You just named one thing I can like about Donald Trump. I like New Yorkers, too (laughter). SHAPIRO: OK, let's switch gears for a moment to talk about the attack in Berlin this week. The man suspected in the attack has been killed by police in Italy. He was originally from Tunisia, had been seeking asylum in Germany. Apparently, he had pledged to support ISIS. What do you see as the domestic political implications of this, David? BROOKS: Well, the - I don't think we're going have a registry of Muslims. I do think there's going to be a lot more personal hostility. I think the biggest effect on America will be the decline of the European project. And whatever happens in the coming French elections, whatever happens in German elections, the fact that we took for granted that Europe was a unifying and stable place mostly given to liberal democratic values. I think that is going away. And we're going to have to grapple with an ugliness of that, a return to history. SHAPIRO: E.J., you don't think this provides momentum for a Trump administration push for if not a Muslim registry then something related to that? DIONNE: Yeah, no, I am very worried that that's the way he is going to try to use it, whether it's a Muslim registry or some of the other things he's talked about. And he made that very clear, if I may quote another Trump tweet today. There were terror attacks in Turkey, Switzerland and Germany, and it is only getting worse. The civilized world must change its thinking. And so Trump clearly is of a mind to use these attacks. But I think Trump's tweet also relates to what David said. What's also at least scary to me is that Trump and his - some of his people seem to side not with the people who partook of the old democratic consensus in Europe, people like Chancellor Angela Merkel in Germany, but the opposition in Western Europe. And that suggests the U.S. is fundamentally changing sides in a big fight in the world. I hope that's wrong, but that's the indication we're getting now. SHAPIRO: Would be nice if Donald Trump might hold a press conference so we could ask him about it. DIONNE: You are right about that. SHAPIRO: E.J. Dionne and David Brooks, thanks as always.

npr,"December 23, 2016",Trump Essay Signals Shift In Approach For 'Teen Vogue'," An online essay went viral this month, the headline - ""Donald Trump Is Gaslighting America."" And it came from a source that surprised a lot of people, including NPR's media correspondent David Folkenflik. Here's David's report on the changes happening at Teen Vogue. DAVID FOLKENFLIK, BYLINE: The author of the piece, Lauren Duca, argues that Trump relies on deception to undermine the truth so that his critics will question their own judgment and their ability to question him. It's a trick called gaslighting. Here's Duca talking to CNN's Don Lemon. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LAUREN DUCA: We're sort of getting lost in semantics and we're getting lost in these disputes about what is true, which is absurd because we should all be able to agree about what's true and... FOLKENFLIK: Duca's post has been seen 1.2 million times and inspired coverage from Italy to Malaysia. Confession time - it's not the kind of discussion I expected from Teen Vogue. I said so on Twitter with a link to the story. People responded two different ways. I was re-tweeted thousands of times and I also got a lot of flak from readers and fans who said, what took you so long to notice? PHILLIP PICARDI: You know, I love saying to people who are surprised by our content, speak to a teenager in your life and you won't be surprised anymore because that really is the foundation of how we approach Teen Vogue now. FOLKENFLIK: This is Phillip Picardi, Teen Vogue's digital editorial director who greenlit Duca's essay. Teen Vogue is, of course, the offshoot of the famed fashion magazine Vogue created in 2003 by its corporate parent Conde Nast. And yet, I wasn't crazy, Teen Vogue had made a big shift. Elaine Welteroth was promoted in May to become the magazine's new editor. ELAINE WELTEROTH: I think Teen Vogue did an incredible job in that beauty and fashion space for young women. But I think about a year and a half ago I'd say, we all kind of came around the table and said, we have to mean more to our girls. Why are we here today? FOLKENFLIK: The need to compete digitally led them to add politics to the mix. Here's how that happened. Picardi had once been an intern at the magazine. He most recently worked at the digital news site Refinery29. In early 2015, Picardi applied for his current job. PICARDI: In one of my interviews, one of the questions was, how do you grow Teen Vogue from 2 million to 10 million a month? And that was largely the answer. FOLKENFLIK: Together, Picardi and Welteroth say they found Teen Vogue's readers hungry to engage. I interviewed the two editors in tandem at their offices, which had a view of the Statue of Liberty. They tell me they draw upon their own identities to help shape coverage. Welteroth just turned 30, Picardi's only 25. She's an African-American. He's gay. PICARDI: There's always something to cover and there's always something to bring the public consciousness to. And that if that matters to reproductive rights, to transgender rights, to LGBTQ equality as a whole, to police brutality and our ongoing struggle with gun violence, you know, we are going to be tireless in how we cover that stuff. FOLKENFLIK: They're not abandoning their franchise, yet Duca's piece on gaslighting has dislodged Teen Vogue's previously most popular post, titled ""How To Apply Glitter Nail Polish The Right Way."" And celebrities including the comedian Sarah Silverman and former CBS News anchor Dan Rather retweeted the essay. Elaine Welteroth defines the audience. WELTEROTH: I think of our readers as young, conscious people. We can't underestimate how far-reaching our content is, especially these days. Phil likes to say that our reader is woke and (laughter) I'd have to agree. PICARDI: It's a vocab (ph) word. WELTEROTH: It's a new vocab word that you can use with your teens and I'd agree with him. FOLKENFLIK: Still, it's been a tough time for magazines. Teen Vogue was slashed last month to four print issues a year. I asked whether Conde Nast was committed to print. Welteroth sidestepped the question, saying the brand had never been stronger. Yet digitally, their new formula has gotten them pretty close to that goal of 10 million distinct readers each month.

npr,"December 23, 2016",'Wall Street Journal' Raises Possible Conflicts Of Interest For Rep. Tom Price," MICHELLE HACKMAN: Thank you for having me. SIEGEL: How heavily invested is Congressman Price in these health-related stocks? HACKMAN: Tom Price, you know, by background is an orthopedic surgeon. So it's probably fair to start off by saying this man is deeply interested in health care. This is his background and so it makes sense that he'd also, you know, know more about health-related stocks than other companies. As of the most recent filings, he has ownership in about 40 different companies that add up to - and this is probably a conservative estimate - but about $300,000 at least. SIEGEL: You reported that well price was actively making trades, he was also actively shaping health legislation. Tell us first about the case of the 21st Century Cures Act and Price's stake in the company in Innate Immuno. HACKMAN: Mr. Price was on the committee that wrote this law that among other things speeds up the process by which drugs and other medical devices can be approved. That really impacts companies that Mr. Price was also buying stock in at the same time that he was writing and passing this legislation, like Innate Immunotherapeutics, which has a drug. It's a multiple sclerosis drug that stands to benefit from accelerated passage through the FDA. SIEGEL: Did the stock price increase? HACKMAN: The stock price doubled after he invested it in August. SIEGEL: And he was investing in other companies as well that were affected by the 21st Century Cures Act? HACKMAN: Yes, he does. So he has stocks and several other pharmaceutical companies including Pfizer, who's also a campaign donor to him. SIEGEL: He has been reporting this activity, do I understand that? HACKMAN: Yes. SIEGEL: Yeah. And what kind of laws or regulations govern members of Congress in the stock market when they do report their investments? HACKMAN: Until about four years ago, members of Congress weren't required to even disclose their stock holdings. And four years ago, there was this public outrage in which a different congressman was sort of using his insider knowledge from his job to buy stocks and make a profit. And so they passed this law called the Stock Act - Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge - where they required all members of Congress to file every trade they made within 45 days, made it explicitly illegal to buy or sell stocks on knowledge that they obtained as members of Congress. SIEGEL: Did you hear anyone characterize his conflict of interest or potential conflict rising to the level of insider trading? HACKMAN: No, we can't make that characterization for sure. I mean, there are some trades that he made that the timing is definitely questionable but I think the work of looking into whether he actually had insider knowledge is something that Senate committees would have to look into. SIEGEL: If he's confirmed as secretary of Health and Human Services, Congressman Price would have to divest himself. HACKMAN: That's true. So members of Congress are allowed to do this. Members of the administration have much stricter ethics rules. SIEGEL: What did you hear back from either Congressman Price or the Trump transition team about the Wall Street Journal story? HACKMAN: We called Congressman Price on Wednesday and he immediately referred us to the Trump transition. The Trump transition team told us naturally that Mr. Price is concentrated on being confirmed and that if he is, he will follow all ethics rules and divest from all these stocks. SIEGEL: Reporter Michelle Hackman of The Wall Street Journal. Thanks for talking with us. HACKMAN: Thank you. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"December 23, 2016",U.S. Abstains On U.N. Security Council Vote Condemning Israeli Settlements," Israelis are furious at the Obama administration today, while Palestinians say it's a day of victory. The U.S. let the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution that condemns Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, areas the Palestinians hope will be part of a future state. In 2011, the U.S. vetoed a similar measure. It abstained today. Here, U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Samantha Power explains why. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SAMANTHA POWER: Since 2011, settlement growth has only accelerated. Since 2011, multiple efforts to pursue peace through negotiations have failed. SHAPIRO: President-elect Donald Trump personally intervened to try to stop the resolution. NPR's diplomatic correspondent Michele Kelemen is here now. And, Michele, explain what happened today. MICHELE KELEMEN, BYLINE: A lot of diplomatic drama, Ari. I mean, the Egyptians were planning to bring this to a vote yesterday, but they withdrew the draft under pressure from Israel and from President-elect Trump, who actually called Egypt's president to talk about this. But several other Security Council members decided today to move forward with the resolution. Several said that they've been worried about Israeli legislation making its way through the Knesset now that would legalize thousands of Israeli homes in the West Bank. And though this was not said on the floor of the Security Council, there's clearly a lot of concern about what the incoming Trump administration means to this issue. The man he's tapped to become ambassador to Israel has supported Israeli settlements and has said that they're not an obstacle to peace. SHAPIRO: What does the resolution actually say? KELEMEN: It demands that Israel stop all settlement activities in the occupied territories including East Jerusalem and the West Bank. Ambassador Power on the floor of the council said this is in line with U.S. policy for decades. It's, you know, we're talking about housing developments and even actual towns that are on land that's supposed to be under negotiations, but the Obama administration hasn't been able to get anywhere with its peace efforts between the Israelis and Palestinians. And throughout all this time, the settler numbers have been increasing. And administration officials today said they came to believe that the whole concept of a two-state solution was at risk. SHAPIRO: Strong reaction today from Congress. Explain what we heard from Capitol Hill. KELEMEN: That's right. I mean, you know, even the incoming Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and many others on both sides of the aisle were - had been encouraging the Obama administration to veto this. They pointed out that the U.N. has a long history of anti-Israel bias and that this resolution's not going to do anything to promote peace. South Carolina's Lindsey Graham, a Republican, is now predicting a backlash in Congress against the U.N. That could mean changes in the way the U.S. funds the United Nations, for instance. And Trump, by the way, tweeted - he wrote, as to the U.N., things will be different after January 20. SHAPIRO: How unusual is it for an incoming president-elect to get as involved in an issue as high profile of this as Donald Trump did with calling the Egyptian leader? KELEMEN: It's very unusual, but in this case he didn't prevail. I mean, 14 Security Council members voted for this resolution, including the Egyptians, who he called on yesterday to back away from it. But, you know, U.S. policy is going to change in January. The Israeli government has already issued a statement saying it's looking forward to that. Today, the Israelis were accusing the U.S. of ganging up on the U.N. against Israel and colluding behind the scenes to get this resolution through. The Obama administration was vehemently denying that, but this obviously caps a very troublesome relationship between President Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

npr,"December 23, 2016",European Banks Reach Multi-Billion Dollar Settlement Over Toxic Mortgages," Two major European banks say they've agreed to pay large penalties, a combined $12-and-a-half billion, to the U.S. government. They are settling claims that they knowingly sold toxic mortgage debt, the securities that fueled the financial crisis eight years ago. NPR's John Ydstie reports. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Under separate agreements, Credit Suisse will pay a total of $5.3 billion, and Deutsche Bank will pay $7.2 billion. About half the money will go to modifying home loans for struggling consumers. The U.S. Justice Department has declined to comment on the deals. In the case of Deutsche Bank, the settlement is about half of what the Justice Department initially wanted, says Hal Scott, a professor at Harvard and director of the nonpartisan Committee on Capital Market Regulation. HAL SCOTT: One of the things that is puzzling about these settlements as well as the prior ones is exactly how these numbers get calculated. YDSTIE: Scott says the process isn't transparent and should involve specifying how much people lost as a result of the bank's activities. Deutsche Bank shares rose on the news that the actual penalty was lower. There were worries the bank would have struggled to pay the larger amount. Some observers have suggested that the Deutsche Bank deal may have been rushed because the Obama administration wanted to complete it before handing the White House over to Donald Trump. He reportedly has loans from the bank of around $300 million. Scott is skeptical. SCOTT: You know, the Justice Department, the people who are conducting this, are professionals. And I highly doubt that that would have had any impact on this. YDSTIE: U.S. authorities have extracted more than $46 billion from U.S. banks in similar cases. Yesterday, the DOJ sued the British bank Barclays after it turned down a settlement. Justice Department probes involving three other big European banks continue. John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington.

npr,"December 23, 2016",President-Elect Trump Suggests Expanding U.S. Nuclear Arsenal," It was unclear whether strengthening and expanding U.S. nuclear capability meant proceeding with the modernization of the nuclear arsenal that's underway or whether it meant something more than that. And then today on the MSNBC program ""Morning Joe,"" hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough said that she had talked to Trump by phone. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""MORNING JOE"") JOE SCARBOROUGH: And the president-elect told you what? MIKA BRZEZINSKI: Let it be an arms race. We will outmatch them at every pass. SCARBOROUGH: And outlast them all. BRZEZINSKI: And outlast them all. SIEGEL: Well, do Donald Trump's words signal a shift on U.S. nuclear strategy? We're going to ask Dan Zak, whose book ""Almighty"" focused on nuclear weapons and their opponents. Welcome to the program. DAN ZAK: Thank you, Robert. SIEGEL: What do you make of Donald Trump's comments about nuclear weapons? ZAK: Well, I don't know. I mean I think without a - holding a proper press conference, we're left not to read tea leaves but tweet leaves. And there are many words in that one tweet that you can interpret. He uses verbs like strengthen and expand. And does that mean, as you said, that he's endorsing this $1 trillion modernization of our nuclear forces, which is already underway? Or does he want to go against decades of policy limiting and reducing the number of weapons. SIEGEL: Put this in the context of what Trump said about nuclear weapons during the campaign or what his campaign said for that matter. ZAK: Well, he was a bit inconsistent. Trump said, you know, he'd be the last to use nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons are a horror. He seemed to understand what they're capable of doing. At the same time, he said it was only a matter of time until countries like South Korea and Japan get nuclear weapons. He seemed to tacitly or not so tacitly endorse proliferation, again going against decades of international policy. SIEGEL: How much would you say his ideas are a shift from recent or historic attitudes toward nuclear weapons? ZAK: I mean we've reduced - the U.S. has reduced its volume of warheads virtually every year since 1967. We had 31,000 in the active stockpile. We have between 4,000 and 5,000 now. By expanding, does he mean add to that? By expanding, does he mean expand the capabilities of that? I mean it's the stated policy of the Obama White House that there will be no new capabilities, no new warheads, and we will reduce the role of nuclear weapons in national security strategy. So that seems to go against not only historical precedent but the Obama administration's stated policy. SIEGEL: Donald Trump did say some things before this most recent tweet about nuclear weapons along the lines of - what's the big deal about nuclear weapons; what's so different about them? That statement is out of line with what presidents. Even regardless of what they did, it's out of line with what presidents have said about nuclear weapons. ZAK: Right, I mean presidents going back to Truman have been very careful about their public statements about these weapons. You have Eisenhower saying you can't have a nuclear war; there aren't enough bulldozers to scrape the bodies off the street. You had Ronald Reagan say, a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. You have President Obama saying, we must seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons. Each of those presidents has presided over either some kind of buildup or some kind of reinvestment in the nuclear arsenal, but they still were very careful about what they said in public. This tweet of Donald Trump's is kind of - I think breaks precedent with that. And so it remains to be seen exactly what he meant and exactly what kind of effect, if any, it will have. SIEGEL: Did you hear the sound of a lot of heads being scratched today after... ZAK: Well... SIEGEL: ...After these remarks? ZAK: Yeah, not only heads being scratched but people talking about how nuclear annihilation is around the corner, that this is it, that a new arms race is underway. And I think that a modicum of concern or even of hysteria is warranted. These are devices that could end civilization. At the same time, you could argue that an arms race is already underway. We're spending a trillion dollars to modernize. And it may not be an arms race in terms of number of weapons, but it could be interpreted as an arms race in terms of capabilities. Like with a lot of things the president-elect has said, there is opportunity to overreact, but it also kind of shines a light on a topic or a truth that we all should be talking about more. SIEGEL: Dan Zak, author of the book ""Almighty,"" thanks. ZAK: Thank you, Robert. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"December 23, 2016","Conservatives Wonder, Will The Real Donald Trump Please Stand Up?"," Here are some of the ways Donald Trump has described himself during the 2016 presidential campaign: ""Very conservative."" ""A common-sense conservative."" ""A conservative with a heart."" But talk to conservative activists, and it's not unusual to still hear things like this: ""Well, I remain a skeptic,"" says activist and GOP campaign veteran Rick Tyler, who adds, ""I don't know that Donald Trump is a conservative."" Billionaire businessman, reality TV star and first-time candidate Trump challenged, insulted, befuddled, shocked and, finally, took over the Republican Party on his way to becoming president-elect. He managed that accomplishment without adhering to traditional conservative principles. In fact, at times it was hard to discern any ideology at all besides a loyalty to himself and a determination to completely upend the American political process. With just weeks until he is sworn in as the 45th president of the United States, conservative activists — like many Americans — will be watching to see just how conservative a president Trump is. 
                Defense Secretary-nominee James Mattis is one of the Trump Cabinet picks that reassure conservatives.

 Defense Secretary-nominee James Mattis is one of the Trump Cabinet picks that reassure conservatives. Cabinet picks encourage some; Trump tweets don't Tyler was communication director for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's presidential campaign. Cruz entered the race thinking he would secure the nomination with help from the GOP's most conservative members — especially evangelicals and members of the Tea Party, who viewed him as a hero for his repeated efforts to repeal Obamacare. Cruz lost, and eventually endorsed Trump in late September, prompting Tyler to say, ""It's mourning in America for conservatives. We lost our leader today."" On Election Day, Tyler says, he voted not for Trump, but for independent candidate Evan McMullin. Still, he says, he's been watching closely as the president-elect assembles his team, and thinks there are at least some indications that Trump will change as president, and actually govern as a conservative. ""If you look at his Cabinet appointments, I can't imagine a more conservative Cabinet than he's picked so far,"" Tyler says. Then he adds something he never imagined during the campaign: ""Some might say it would be even more conservative than Ted Cruz's Cabinet."" He cautions, though, that Trump's position on free trade and trade deals remains anything but conservative. Then there's Trump's undisciplined use of Twitter — unprecedented for someone in his position — and a very un-conservative approach to communicating. He's talking about the @RealDonaldTrump Twitter account, but also Trump's unscripted rhetoric at his rallies. ""You can say you're joking around, but it confuses a lot of people,"" Tyler says. It may be OK to say things to confuse our enemies, he adds. ""That's certainly true in war,"" he says, but ""I don't think it's OK to confuse the world in diplomacy and foreign policy.""

 Trump delivered the convocation at Liberty University, a private Christian university in Virginia founded by televangelist Jerry Falwell, in January. Evangelicals backed Trump, but say they demand results Bob Vander Plaats is one of the country's top evangelical voices. Based in Iowa, Vander Plaats backed Cruz for president, but says he voted for Trump and has been friends with him for years. He recalls a meeting with candidate Trump this summer, after the primaries were over. ""At that time I told him, 'I'm not going to endorse you, but I'll be your friend. And that means when you do things that are worthy of cheering you on, I'll cheer you on,' "" Vander Plaats says. But he also told Trump, ""When you do things that are outside the lines, outside the boundaries, I'm gonna try to hold you accountable."" In fact, when the infamous Access Hollywood tape emerged, in which Trump talked about being able to force himself on women because ""when you're a star you can do anything, grab 'em by the [expletive],"" Vander Plaats called for Trump to quit the race. He says it was just one of many times he thought Trump's campaign was over. He was wrong. Vander Plaats did vote for Trump, but says his approach going forward with the new president will be the same as he told the candidate at that meeting in the summer. One thing that Vander Plaats has always been happy about was Trump's selection of Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as his running mate. To evangelical voters, the presence of Pence as vice president is very reassuring. ""Mike Pence is one of us,"" says Vander Plaats, ""He comes from us, not just to us."" Very early on, he says, Trump will face an important test, when he decides on a nominee to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia. Vander Plaats puts it succinctly.

 Trump waives to supporters at a  Tea Party in Washington in September 2015. ""For the first time our people are in the room, you know?"" says a Tea Party leader. For the Tea Party, perhaps a chance to relax? Finally, to a group that has been an uncompromising attack force against Democrats — and even some Republicans — the Tea Party. Tom Zawistowski leads a Tea Party group in northeast Ohio, where he says they are basking in Trump's victory, and even relaxing a bit. He says it's like they've been at war for almost eight years, and that war is over. Their guys won. That, he says, will allow them to shift the focus from Washington to home. ""It's kind of a takeoff on Trump's 'Make America Great Again,' "" he says. ""But now it's kind of something like, 'Make our communities great again.' "" Zawistowski says the transition has been everything he has hoped for so far. He applauds Trump's Cabinet choices, including Rep. Mike Mulvaney of South Carolina, picked to be budget director. ""For the first time our people are in the room, you know? At the meeting."" So Zawistowski says they now have the luxury of sitting back and watching people you trust go to work. ""I think you owe them that. You owe them that respect, because they are where they are because you put 'em there. But if it's strange to hear a Tea Partly leader say ""stand down,"" Zawistowki says they'll still be watching. And if Trump goes astray, or if GOP leaders stand in the way, he promises the Tea Party response will be very loud. NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor ",http://www.npr.org/506615235
npr,"December 23, 2016",DOJ's Big Bank Settlements Remove Potential Conflict Of Interest For Trump," In the last days of the Obama administration, the federal government has reached multibillion-dollar settlements with Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse over their sale of toxic mortgage securities. President-elect Donald Trump owes Deutsche Bank hundreds of millions of dollars in loans. So that deal removes a potential conflict of interest — where a Trump Justice Department would have been negotiating the settlement. Deutsche Bank settled for $7.2 billion, while Credit Suisse agreed to pay $5.3 billion. The deals resolve U.S. investigations into the sale of toxic securities tied to mortgages in the run-up to the financial crisis. Regulators have already struck similar deals with major U.S. banks. A third European bank, Barclays, resisted a settlement offer and is now being sued by the Justice Department. Most of these cases involved the banks' so-called securitization of home loans. That is — the banks would pool thousands of individual home loans and bundle them into a security, of which the bank could then sell shares to investors. The problem was that in many cases, the banks were telling investors and ratings agencies that these loans were much more likely to be repaid than they actually were. The time frame dates to the crazy days of the housing bubble, when lenders were making loans to homebuyers with no proof of income and the terms and interest rates on many of the mortgages made them impossible for homeowners to repay over time. It was this packaging of largely garbage loans — and telling investors they were safe and solid investments — that was at the heart of the financial crisis. Many investors suffered massive losses. Entire financial institutions collapsed or required government bailouts to survive. So in effect, these settlements are an effort to make the major banks involved pay a penalty for helping to crash the global financial system and for sending they U.S. economy into recession. The multibillion-dollar bank settlements at least sound like pretty stiff penalties. ""They're very substantial,"" says Harvard Law School professor Hal Scott. But he adds, ""In the case of Deutsche [Bank], at least we know it's roughly half of what the Justice Department was seeking initially."" Scott says it's puzzling to him how these sums get arrived at. He's an expert on international financial systems. He says the Justice Department's methodology for the penalties in these mega-bank-settlements isn't public: ""We don't know exactly how they do that."" ""If I were doing this I would start by trying to determine you know how much did people lose as a result of these activities,"" Scott says. ""That would be a starting point."" So he says greater transparency into questions and calculations like that would give these settlements greater credibility.

npr,"December 23, 2016",Transcript: NPR's Interview With CIA Director John Brennan," NPR's national security correspondent Mary Louise Kelly sat down for a 52-minute interview Thursday with CIA Director John Brennan at CIA headquarters in northern Virginia. Kelly asked about Russian interference in the U.S. election, how the CIA views President-elect Donald Trump and the future of Syria. Brennan also shared some of his plans for his post-CIA life. (Hint: He won't be writing a spy thriller). MARY LOUISE KELLY: Let me start with Russia. The White House has ordered a review, and I respect that you don't want to get out ahead of that. I also respect that you cannot get into details of evidence that's classified. But a yes-or-no question: Do you, as head of the CIA, stand by the October statement that represented the consensus of U.S. intelligence, that Russia tried to interfere with the U.S. election? CIA DIRECTOR JOHN BRENNAN: Absolutely. Yes I do. You do? I do. That same statement also said only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized this interference. And the statement used the word ""confident,"" that U.S. intelligence is confident in those things, which is a word I know that you all don't use lightly. You've seen the intelligence; those of us in the public have not. But can you say hand over heart that you've seen it and it's solid? Well, I can say that the statement that was issued by [Homeland Security] Secretary [Jeh] Johnson, as well as DNI [Director of National Intelligence James] Clapper, was one that was very carefully considered. Going out publicly with that in early October, the month before the election, we wanted to make sure that there was full confidence in the language in there in terms of the responsibility for those compromises, as well as the intention to interfere with the election. So we stand by it today. We are following through with the president's request to do a thorough and rigorous and comprehensive review. The president wants that to make sure that we understand fully what happened, what we need to learn from this experience, as well as to make sure that the incoming administration appreciates the extent of the concern that I think we as a government have, this administration has, about the opportunities for trouble-making in that digital domain. And I think this most recent experience with the Russian activities during this election really underscores the importance of making sure that we as a government take the appropriate steps to protect and safeguard our way of life as well as the tenets of our current democratic process. You mentioned the importance of making sure that the incoming administration understands the seriousness of what happened. How significant is that to you, and to what extent do you think they don't get it yet? Well, it's critically important to me, both as the current head of the CIA as well as when I was down at the White House, my responsibility was homeland security. And over the last eight years, I think the Obama administration really has tried to take steps to safeguard that environment because this country's national security, as well as our prosperity, really rests on what we can do to secure that digital domain. And we want to make sure that the next administration, I want to make sure that my successor, and Mike Pompeo has been designated to be President-elect Trump's nominee, that they are able to take the baton that we have been running with for the past eight years and do everything possible to protect the government's networks, databases and systems, but also to protect this country's systems. So I think it is very important, and I think there are some people who are going to be coming into the administration who are unfamiliar with the extent of the threat, the nature of it, how diverse it is, as well as unfamiliar with the intelligence capabilities. And so we have a special responsibility and obligation to make sure that they are as informed, as enlightened, as knowledgeable as possible, because they have the responsibility to protect this country's future. The White House has also said they'd like to make as much public as possible. And as you know, just saying ""Hey, we've seen it, we're the CIA, trust us"" doesn't cut it in 2016. People want to see the evidence for themselves. How much will you be able to make public of what you know? I believe that this administration is going to try to inform the American people as much as possible about what happened, what the nature of that threat is and continues to be. There needs to be appropriate consideration given to the protection of information that will allow us to continue to monitor and prevent these types of attacks. So I think it's always a balance when you need to go out publicly with information, optimize what it is that you're able to push out publicly, but at the same time, protect that which needs to be protected. I've been told in this particular case, it's proving even trickier than usual in your line of work — the sourcing issue and how much you can put out there, make public without compromising sensitive sources. Well, I think this is something that is a challenge for us on a number of fronts when we're talking about the digital environment and capabilities, that we have to see and prevent and take steps against these types of attacks and exploitations. So there is, you know, there are technical issues. There are a whole host of intelligence capabilities that we need to make sure that are going to continue to thrive in the future. And that's what I think, I know that Jim Clapper, Jim Comey, myself ... ... that's the FBI director and the director of national intelligence ... Right, and President Obama, they all want to be able to again optimize that which we can share publicly but optimize as well the continued capabilities of intelligence, law enforcement, homeland security to carry out their responsibilities. You mentioned the FBI director and the director of national intelligence. And NPR confirmed with three sources that after the three of you meeting last week, you sent a memo to your workforce and that the memo read: There is strong consensus among us on the scope, nature and intent of Russian interference in our presidential elections. Is that an accurate quote from your memo? I certainly believe that, that there is strong consensus. Was there ever not? Well, sometimes in the media, there is claims, allegations, speculation about differences of view. Sometimes I think that just feeds concerns about, you know, the strength of that intelligence and ... And in this case it was reports of tension between FBI and CIA ... ... and differences of view. And I want to make sure that our workforce is kept as fully informed as possible so that they understand that what we're doing, we're doing in close coordination with our partners in the intelligence community. And so I try to keep my workforce informed on a periodic basis. But aside from whatever message I might have sent out to the workforce, there is, I strongly believe, very strong consensus among the key players — but not just the leaders of these organizations, but also the institutions themselves. And that's why we're going through this review. We want to make sure that we scrub this data, scrub the information and make sure that the assessment and analysis is as strong and as grounded as it needs to be. That quote I read you about the memo that you sent mentioned that there is agreement on scope, nature and intent of Russian interference. And intent is the one that's been controversial recently, the question of motive. How confident are you in the intelligence on that? It seems like proving motive is an infinitely harder thing than proving that somebody did something. The ""why"" is tough. I will not disagree with you that the why is tough. And that's why there needs to be very careful consideration of what it is that we know, what it is that we have insight into and what our analysis needs to be. But even back in early October when Jim Clapper and Jeh Johnson put out this statement, it said ""the intent to interfere in the election."" Now, there are different elements that could be addressed in terms of how it wanted to interfere. And so that's why this review is being done to make sure that there is going to be a thorough look at the nature, scope and intent of what transpired. What's been reported is that the CIA has concluded the intent was to interfere with the election with the purpose of swinging at Donald Trump. Is that an accurate characterization? That's an accurate characterization of what's been appearing in the media. Yes. Is it an accurate characterization of where the CIA is on this? Well, that's what the review is going to do. And we will be as forward-leaning as the intelligence and analysis allows us to be, and we will make sure that, again, President Obama and the incoming administration understands what the intelligence community has assessed and determined to have happened during the run-up to this election. Why not confirm that that's where the CIA is on this? Why not confirm if you have the evidence that you believe is ... Because I don't work for NPR, Mary Louise. I work for the president, I work for the administration, and it is my responsibility to give them the best information and judgment possible. I have been keeping the administration, senior administration, the president informed about this for several months. I have had numerous interactions with the Congress on this as well. And those are my principal obligations, and now that there has been this request by the president, or direction, to do this report, and there will be things to release to the public whenever that is done. I will be happy to talk to you about it then. Fair enough. I don't know if I would be happy to talk to you about then, but I'm willing to talk to you about it then. Thank you. We'll take you up on that. The president, President Obama, in an interview with NPR last week, said, and I'm quoting him, ""we will"" respond to Russian interference. And I'm curious, I realize that's a policy issue, I realize you don't do policy, but you, in an interview recently with the BBC, said the U.S. should not stoop to their level. Meaning should not stoop to Russia's level, should not respond in kind to Russian interference. Why not? Well, again, it is a decision that this president and or the next president will take as far as how to respond to what we have seen. But what are the concerns you have in terms of responding in kind? Well, this country is based on the democratic principles that our nation was founded upon. And there is a lot of challenges throughout the world to those principles of freedom, liberty, freedom of speech and the will of the people in order to govern as they see fit. And the election process is one of those foundational elements of our democracy. And I individually believe that there are certain things that this government, our country, should not be engaged in because it is inconsistent with those precepts, those tenets of the United States of America. So this was what's making, you know, this challenging, which is how to safeguard our system, safeguard our digital domain, and make sure that there are decisions that can be taken that will deter, maybe sometimes punish those who violate the law, as well as try to attack our national security and try to undermine the democracy that we are. So that's why the intelligence input to President Obama and President-elect Trump is going to be very critically important in terms of making those decisions that are going to be, I think, very consequential in terms of what we might see in the future along these lines. Help me understand. Connect that line for me. How would retaliating in kind — so, a cyberattack against Russia — how would that undermine American democratic principles? Well, I think if we hold dear the principles of democracy, liberty, freedom and freedom of speech and the right of people everywhere to have governments of their choosing, preventing the conduct of a free and fair and open election, devoid of interference and foreign manipulation, is something that I think the United States government, as well as the American people, would certainly want to make sure that's going to be who we are. And so there are a lot of things that those adversaries, enemies that we have, whether they be terrorists or proliferators or ... whomever. Nation-states. They do some things that I think are beyond the pale. That's why I don't think we should resort to some of the tactics and techniques that our adversaries employ against us. I think we need to remember what we're fighting for. We're fighting for our country, our democracy, our way of life, and to engage in the skulduggery that some of our opponents and adversaries engage in, I think, is beneath this country's greatness. It's interesting because you're speaking to the rules of cyberwarfare. Are there clear rules? It seems as though the U.S. is playing one game and an adversary like Russia is playing by entirely different rules. Well, that's a good point, that there are no — well, there are international norms and standards that are adhered to mainly and endorsed by governments. And there are a lot of things that are being done by nation-states or groups or individuals that are inconsistent with those norms and standards. But given that the digital domain does not respect sovereign boundaries and therefore is not subject to legal enforcement by individual governments, it makes it quite challenging. But I do believe that we can look at ways to protect this country's future prosperity and security in that digital domain without having to resort to those types of activities that, again, are inconsistent with who we are as a people. That doesn't mean that we don't have powerful capabilities. I'm not saying we shouldn't do some things in the digital domain, in the cyber domain. We do have tremendous capability. But I don't think, and it's something that if I were to be asked either as a policymaker or as a private citizen — should this country engage in manipulating foreign elections? — I would say absolutely not. We need to make sure that we are going to lead the way when it comes to allowing countries and people to choose their leaders, free of that foreign interference. And that's the concerns we have, as we've seen, not just the United States but in other countries as well, the hand of foreign actors. And I don't think it's a secret that the the Russians have tried to influence the outcome of elections in other countries as well. So this is not just a question of their cyber activity. It's a question of their using their influence in ways that are inconsistent, I believe, with what should be happening in these countries' electoral processes. And you said the U.S. should not be involved in trying to influence the outcome of elections in other countries? I do not believe we should be involved in trying to influence the outcome of elections in foreign countries. That's not something you would have heard everybody who's occupied your position here at CIA saying over the decades. Maybe. And I think certainly in the 21st century this is something that the United States ... The U.S. hasn't tried to interfere and influence the outcome of any election in the 21st century? To my knowledge, no. That is something that certainly this president and I think even the last president, last administration and administrations before that. Encouraging participation, trying to make sure that people do have the opportunity and the right to vote in elections and that those electoral systems and campaigns are done without that foreign interference, yes, that's something we encourage. But as far as trying to influence the outcome and to shape the outcome so that a preferred candidate emerges on top, no, that is something that this administration and, I can say, in previous administrations as well — I'm not going to go back into the far reaches of U.S. history, but I will say that what it is that we are trying to do today, is to make sure that people everywhere are able to experience the fruits of democracy. You mentioned the incoming administration and the importance of their understanding all of the intelligence that exists and that is out there. President-elect Trump, we are told, has gotten a couple of intelligence briefings this week, but he has declined the tradition, the recent tradition at least, of getting a daily intelligence briefing in the run-up to the inauguration. And he and his incoming national security adviser have been dismissive of, I think safe to say even scornful of, the CIA. Why should President-elect Trump trust the CIA? Well, I think the the CIA has a rich history of being able to inform, enlighten our leaders, our policymakers. And I do think that a number of people who would be coming into the administration, some have distant history as far as being part of the government. Some never were in the government before. So I believe it's our solemn obligation as CIA officers to make sure that all of our new administration officials, from President-elect Trump and Vice President Pence on down and national security adviser-designee Mike Flynn, that they understand the breadth and depth of our capabilities. And I've told our people here at CIA: You have a solemn obligation to carry out your statutory responsibilities to inform and enlighten the senior-most members of this government and making sure that the CIA carries out its responsibilities in terms of our responsibilities for clandestine collection, all-source analysis, counterintelligence, covert action, liaison engagements across the range of responsibilities. And we need to make sure that we're able to educate the people that are coming into the government. This is the time for CIA officers to shine, and I've told them to look upon this as an opportunity. And I have not had any conversations with the president-elect Trump or Mike Flynn about their views on intelligence. And I do believe that they will appreciate the value of that intelligence if they don't already. And I believe that, with more exposure, they will understand just how important our work is and how much we can help them succeed in terms of what this country needs to do over the next four years at least. It sounds like you're saying Donald Trump doesn't get what the CIA can do yet, but he will. I think it's very difficult for anybody outside of the government, outside of those who have knowledge of the intelligence community, to really appreciate what it is that we do and understand. There's a lot of misperceptions about what the agency does, based on some media reports and movies and other things, that there needs to be a process whereby they can absorb what our capabilities are, the expertise. We have some of the world's greatest experts on so many issues, and I cannot be prouder of the people in the agency. And as I've told them, you're going to have the opportunity to really impress a new group of people and really have them better understand the challenges, the threats, the opportunities that are out there. So I don't look upon the incoming administration as one that is not going to absorb intelligence. I look upon the new administration as one that is going to be thirsty for this inside information, because a lot of it is going to be very new to them. So I think people are energized and are looking forward to the opportunity to talk to a new administration. Do you have any insight into why they haven't been thirsty yet for the insights? I wouldn't say they're not thirsty. There are continual briefings and meetings, and having been part of the transition team for then-President-elect Obama, that period of time between Election Day and Inauguration Day is full of things to do in terms of picking senior people and just getting, you know, your organization ready to move from a campaign and a winning ticket to a new administration. So I think there are only a certain number of hours in the day, and I'm not going to presume that I know all of the things that the incoming team were trying to accomplish. But I am confident that over time, there's going to be a rich appreciation of what it is that the CIA and our intelligence community colleagues bring to our national security. I'd love to let you respond to two pieces of criticism. One is that the Trump transition team has pushed back hard against some CIA judgments. They released a statement saying, and I'm quoting, ""These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction."" Do they have a point? They haven't said anything to me or to CIA directly. That was a public statement though. Well, I'm sure that this is part of their perception of what CIA has done in the past. But the CIA got it wrong on Iraq. Well, you know, the intelligence community did not call it 100 percent accurate in the run-up to the Iraq War. So why should they trust you now? Well, because there are many, many, many, many things that the CIA has in fact done and has called correctly. We don't have a perfect record. I understand that. And I will, if I have the opportunity to talk to the incoming team, I will talk to them about some of the things that we really are quite proud of and do. But intelligence is both a science and an art, and there are some things that we know with certainty, some things that we infer, some things that we assess, but sometimes the truth can be quite elusive. And yes, there have been times in the past where we fell short. But I can point out numerous occasions when this agency did save lives, kept this country safe, and we as Americans should be quite proud of what legions of agency officers have done over our history. The other criticism of late has been that the CIA has waded in to politics in a way that it shouldn't. And I want to let you respond to a quote. This is from Republican Congressman Pete King, who sits on the Intelligence Committee, who says you should be — you, personally, John Brennan — should be investigated for orchestrating a ""hit job"" on Donald Trump. Do you personally, does the CIA as an agency, are you orchestrating a hit job on Donald Trump? Do you have an ax to grind with the president-elect? Ah, Peter King. He's somebody who I've had, you know, many engagements over the years. I must say he is a great politician, and he is really quite skilled in these types of political fulminations and has been quite active in many respects. I've had run-ins with them over the years and also have had very good conversations with him. So I think as a very strong partisan, in many respects, I think he is doing what many politicians will do at times like this, which is to try to defend, if not attack, those that he believes are challenging maybe his colleagues and party or whatever but ... You don't think he means it? Oh, well, he, I think, again, he is quite skilled in hyperbole as well as these soundbites. And Peter King is somebody who I respect and admire his political skills, but — and he can investigate me, that's fine. I am very, very confident that the CIA carried out its responsibilities very well. And I am happy to talk to members of Congress who might want to ask me questions about our role. To his broader point, because he's not the only person who's raised it: Does the CIA have it in for Donald Trump? [laughs] We are apolitical. We are nonpartisan. We serve our policymakers and our presidents irrespective of political party, and we try to carry out our duties to the best of our ability. And so we have it out for no one except this country's adversaries and enemies. And if you're an adversary and enemy of this country, you should be afraid of CIA because we will work to thwart your aims. But if you are a member of this government, and if you are a peace-loving American, you should have great pride in what it is that we do. So we certainly do not have it out for any administration or any senior official or the incoming president. You mentioned Mike Pompeo who, if he's confirmed, will be your successor as director of the CIA. Has he reached out to you? Have you started briefing him on ... ? I have, I have known Mike Pompeo, Congressman Pompeo from Kansas, because he's on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, the HPSCI, the oversight committee. I have met with him a number of times. I have talked to him ... Since he was nominated? Oh, yes, absolutely. And in fact I have spoken to him this week a couple of times. I want to make sure that the CIA is doing what we need to do in order to ensure that his process for confirmation goes along smoothly and he is working that. And he is not presuming confirmation, so he is doing the absolute right thing in terms of focusing on that upcoming hearing. But he is somebody who, when I've spoken to him, he's excited, he's humbled by the opportunity, he recognizes that this is a tremendous organization and he would consider it a great, great honor to have the opportunity to lead the women and men of CIA. And as long as I'm director of CIA here, I'll make sure that we continue to run with the baton up until Inauguration Day. And I look forward to being able to hand this baton off to somebody who is as dedicated American as Mike Pompeo is, a former military officer and a serving member of Congress and somebody who is savoring the opportunity to come here to CIA. Also someone who has expressed very strong political views — appropriate for a congressman, less so for a CIA director. I was struck by statements the two of you both made recently on Iran. You, in an interview, said it would be the height of folly to roll back the nuclear deal. And Mike Pompeo was tweeting the day before he was nominated, saying, calling the nuclear deal ""disastrous"" and that he looked forward to rolling back. Safe to say you two have a different world view on certain things? Safe to say that we, if we were in different positions at the time. As an intelligence official, I will speak my mind about what I see as threats to U.S. national security. Mike Pompeo, as a congressman from Kansas and as a politician, I think he serves his constituency as well as his political leanings well. He is outspoken, which is, which is good. But I think he recognizes that, as a politician, he has the absolute right to take political stances on issues, just the way I as an intelligence official have every right to take positions on national security issues, which I do. So the fact that we may not have said the same thing, I think, is a reflection of the different positions that we hold. Will he need to park those strong world views when he comes in as CIA director and his task is to provide objective intelligence and information to the president, particularly when it may not be the exact intelligence and advice that the president wants to hear? And I'm sure that Mike will enjoy talking to you as much as I enjoy talking to you about these issues when he comes in. Greatly, then. But I think he certainly recognizes the difference between being a congressman from Kansas and being the director of CIA. You think he gets that. Oh, absolutely. He is a West Point graduate. He is a Harvard-trained lawyer, a member of Congress, and he recognizes that if he has the great honor to raise his right hand and swear an oath of allegiance to his country as CIA director, that he has statutory responsibilities that he needs to carry out to the best of his ability, and that is to make sure that the CIA and the director of CIA fulfills their apolitical, nonpartisan role to make sure they carry out the CIA's mission. During your time here, you launched some of the most sweeping reforms in the history of the CIA, creating missions where you have spies and analysts working side by side, focused on certain regions and topics. You created a new Directorate for Digital Innovation, to beef up CIA's technical and cyber capabilities. As you speak to your incoming successor, Mike Pompeo, is your sense that he will leave those changes in place? Well, I felt a special responsibility since I served 25 years in CIA to do what I could here on the organizational front to make sure that we're postured well for the future. I've talked to Mike about the modernization program we have underway here. He is very familiar with it. I briefed his committee many times. I told him that to me, the modernization process should never end because we have to constantly adapt to the realities that we have to deal with in the outside world. And my recommendation to Mike was to, when he comes here, get to know the place as best he can. This is a large organization, a complex organization, but a very powerful organization. I'm sure during the course of his tenure, he will look at things just the way I did and say, you know, we need to adjust this or tweak that. I believe, though, that if this agency is going to fulfill its mission to the best of its ability, we need to take full advantage of the great expertise and capabilities and tools and authorities we have. And that mission-center construct is one that integrates it. I think Mike, as a military officer, I think will see that there are some similarities between what we did and what the military did as far as forming those combatant commands so that you have the benefit of Marines, Air Force, Army, Navy brought together. So I'm confident that this integration model is going to continue in the future. But I'm also pretty confident that there will be subsequent adjustments, as there need to be, as the agency continues to adapt to the evolving nature of the world environment. Let me turn you to one of the regions of the world that I know has occupied a lot of your time and will presumably occupy Mike Pompeo's as well, and that's Syria, which you have described is the most complex situation you have ever had to grapple with ... ... and the most heartbreaking, too, for me. Why the most complex? I think the heartbreaking thing is obvious to all of us. Complex because there are so many internal actors and external actors involved. There are also a number of competing interests and objectives. There is such a variety of confessional groups, of ethnic groups, of individuals who adhere to different religious faiths. And it's all brought together in that area, and it's made also more complex by the fact that you have an authoritarian leader in Bashar Assad, who seems to have no compulsion against using weapons of war to kill, maim and injure countless number of Syrian civilians. But you also have then the involvement of Iran and Hezbollah and Russia that have brought to bear their capabilities inside of Syria, and you have terrorist organizations like ISIL and also like Jabhat al-Nusra, al-Qaida in Syria, that have taken advantage of a lot of the political vacuums that have occurred as well as just the fighting. So it's become a cauldron of activity of individuals and groups that have their own individual agendas and objectives. We are trying to make sure that the Syrian people can emerge from this experience with a political process that's going to give them the government they deserve, that's going to truly represent all the various groups inside Syria, while the same time trying to crush and destroy terrorists that are thriving right now and in many parts of the country. So there are competing objectives, and sometimes these objectives are, U.S. objectives, are in direct tension with one another, which really makes this so complicated. One new twist seems to be what's being described as perhaps a new constellation of power in the region: Iran, Russia, Turkey. There were three-way talks this week. The U.S. was not invited. How much insight do you have into that axis, or would you even describe it that way? Well, I think there certainly have been discussions and talks that are going on among them. I think in some areas they have complimentary interests and objectives. I think there are areas also where they disagree. And I think sometimes that the Russians will try to take advantage of tactical opportunities that may exist to forge some agreements and alliances. But I do think that over time, those three countries alone are not going to be able to resolve the problems in that region. But I do see that some of the actors, for a variety of reasons, are seeking to form alliances to see whether or not they can advance their common objectives. But also, I see that there is going to be real conflict among them on some other elements of this problem. Because the long-term goals don't align? Long-term goals as well as, there are — again, some of the players that are inside the country are aligned with some of those states and not with others. And sometimes the proxies that they try to work with will have their own agendas that will, I think, disrupt some of their benefactors' objectives. So this is a very dynamic situation right now. Things are going to continue to move, and I think over the next several months, we're going to continue to see, unfortunately, a lot of violence and bloodshed. So I think there will be a number of false starts on solutions. But this cannot be resolved in the battlefield. This insurgency inside of Syria is not going to go away. Even if the terrorist groups are crushed, there are many Syrians that have had their lives torn asunder by Bashar Assad, and they're not going to stop until he is out of power. And I think his getting out of power is going to be really the first step toward Syria's future. I was going to ask you. It looks as though this week we're seeing the battle for Aleppo drawing to a close, and I was going to ask: Do you see that as the beginning of the end of conflict in Syria? It sounds like the answer is a firm no. No, I don't believe so. What we see is the deliberate attempts to exterminate the opposition forces that were in Aleppo and there were some terrorists that were there. The destruction of Aleppo really has been an awful, awful demonstration of sort of a scorched-earth policy on the part of the regime as well as the Russians, and to many Syrians, men, women and children, have died there. And unfortunately there are many individuals who are now trying to figure out where they go next. They are allowed to leave Aleppo. But as you know, they go up maybe toward Idlib, is that going to be the next phase of what the regime is doing to try to exterminate the opposition? So, yes, there were some of the members of the terrorist groups that were in Aleppo, but the overwhelming number of opposition there were part of what was the Free Syrian Army. So Aleppo's destruction, Aleppo's fall, to me is not a sign that there is going to be an end to this conflict, because I am convinced that many, many of those oppositionists — the ones who are trying to reclaim their country for their families, for their neighbors, for their children — will continue to fight. So this insurgency is not going to go away until there is some type of viable and genuine political process that will bring to power in Damascus a government that is representative of the Syrian people and really will try to repair and recover from this awful war. [EDITOR'S NOTE: The batteries in the recorder died at the end of this answer, so the question was re-asked at the end of the interview. For concision, we have combined the two answers in this transcript.] One more on Syria. One of the questions put to President Obama at his White House news conference last week was about Syria, and it was specifically whether he felt any personal moral responsibility for what was going on in Aleppo, and he said he did. I want to put the same question to you. The CIA is involved in that conflict in ways that you can acknowledge publicly, and in ways that I know you won't. But do you feel any personal moral responsibility for, as you said, that the heartbreak that we see happening there? I certainly feel a connection with Syria, the Syrian people. It's a country that I traveled to a number of times, and I just see the devastation of the people, of the landscape, of the ancient cities. So I think, you know, we all who are involved, in one form or another, certainly feel that connection. We feel some responsibility. I think we always like to say that we wish that we would have been able to make a difference in a way that would have prevented the slide and the situation there. So there's no way you can divorce yourself, emotionally or mentally, from these situations that you play a role in. We also have to recognize, though, that as great a country, as powerful a country as the United States is, we have, in many areas, limited ability to influence the course of events. And you try things and you hope and you plan and you strategize. But there are a lot of factors, a lot of variables, a lot of unforeseen developments as well as actions. And then it comes down to some decisions that need to be made as far as what's the extent, the nature of U.S. engagement and whether or not certain policy decisions are really in keeping with what our national security demands. And these are really tough, tough calls. And when I was down the White House and I was a policymaker, a part of that policy circle, these are issues that you really agonized over. And I know that President Obama has agonized over them. And when we meet in the Situation Room, we look at a lot of these challenges and what does the, what can the United States do and what type of commitment we want to make, whether it be on the economic side or on the military side or on the intelligence side. There are a lot of factors that go into that ultimate decision. Opportunity costs, as well as if you take certain steps, what does that mean as far as the follow-on steps and actions that might be required? So these are tough, tough calls. In the case of the CIA, those steps have involved helping to arm some of the moderate rebels as — as defined by CIA. Has the CIA gotten that balance right? They've been armed to the extent that they can continue fighting, not armed enough to win decisively. The United States government has provided support both political as well as other types of assistance to elements of the opposition. And I will not address what CIA may or may not be doing. I know there's a lot of things that are out there in the media. But I will say that there are thousands of these fighters, the opposition, who want to reclaim their country and are looking for support from the outside because they recognize that fighting against one of the largest Arab armies, the Syrians, along with Hezbollah, a formidable paramilitary military force, Iran, as well as Russia. And that overwhelming firepower against opposition fighters who are lightly armed and are again trying to protect their families, their villages, their neighborhoods without external supports, they are just overpowered. They've done a remarkable job, I think, in terms of trying to prevent Bashar from just overrunning the country. But if I may, I'll put the question again: Has the U.S. provided the right amount of support? I think it's clear that the opposition has not had the type of capability necessary to push back against the regime and pro-regime forces that have come to bear. And so these opposition forces get their support from a number of quarters. And it's clear that that type of support was coming from the outside has been insufficient to prevent the fall of Aleppo, to prevent the fall of some other areas. So that's what the, you know, the opposition has looked for is that external support that they need to go up against these are overwhelming odds. One other place in the world that I want to ask you about: North Korea. Where does North Korea and its nuclear ambitions rank in the list of things that keep you awake at night? It is certainly in the top five. What would be the others, if I may? [laughs] Well, I have about 20 or 30 other things that are in the top five that compete. [laughs] OK. There are a lot of ties there. But North Korea, given that Kim Jong Un has demonstrated, I think, some real irresponsibility and continued march toward having a nuclear weapons program with ballistic missile capability that could not just threaten regional states but also this country. I think this is something that needs to be at the forefront of the security agenda of the next administration. It has certainly been on this administration's agenda. And so we cannot allow, in my mind, this situation in North Korea to continue its current trajectory, because there is just, I think, real potential for his destabilizing actions in the region that threaten our security interests in that region but also can threaten our homeland as well. What might change North Korea's trajectory? It's described as the land of lousy policy options. Yes. Well, I think we've worked with China, and I think China also recognizes that North Korea is a problem. I think it stands in China's way of accomplishing a number of Beijing's objectives in terms of its regional relations as well as relations with the United States. I do think ultimately it's going to be up to the United States, along with China, South Korea, Japan and others, to have a united front when it comes to North Korea, making sure there's a united international front in terms of the sanctions and actions that can be taken against North Korea. Hopefully, the people of North Korea will recognize that Kim Jong Un is just trying to perpetuate his reign and rule at their expense. The impoverishment of the North Korean people is something that is awful. And his continued dumping of resources into military programs when he should be trying to feed his people is really something that I think the entire international community should address and do with tougher sanctions and tougher measures. But China has to be part of that. The current assessment is that North Korea, if it continues at its current pace, could have a nuclear armed missile capable of hitting the continental U.S. within the next five years. Is that right? The course that it's on is a worrisome one because it's made very clear its intention to continue its nuclear program as well as its continued development of ballistic missile capability of various ranges including intercontinental. Is that time frame, five years, is that roughly right? Well, whenever we make these determinations, assessments of that, a lot of factors have to be taken into account. There are issues related to the reliability of certain weapon systems. But I think that if Kim Jong Un has even a small percent chance of being able to deliver a nuclear weapon to other states or this homeland, to me, that's a greater percent than we should allow to continue. Last point on North Korea. Dennis Wilder, who used to work for you here at CIA, also has worked on North Korea at the White House, he told me that his biggest concern is that right now North Korea has enough fissile material for about 10 to 20 nuclear weapons but that at their current rate of development, by 2020 they could have enough for 50. The danger being they would have surplus, they would have enough to export. How worrying is that? We are concerned about North Korea's nuclear program, and we keep the president and Congress fully informed about our assessments about their nuclear capability stockpile, as well as their ballistic missile capabilities and developments. So as I said, the trajectory that North Korea is on is one that I think needs to be disrupted, because they continue to try to acquire greater capability. And there needs to be some way for this situation to be resolved. Not advocating any type of military solution to this. I've said I hope that Kim Jong Un, with external pressure, is going to realize that the path he's on is one that is not going to give North Korea the type of of support and assistance that it needs. It does not have the ability to feed its people. It needs to be able to correct that course, and he sees military capability as being the key to getting that type of recognition and respect and assistance. It's not. It's getting him the opprobrium of the international community. And I think that the pressure on North Korea, in terms of sanctions and other types of actions, is only destined to increase in the future. Is there a Stuxnet for North Korea? [laughs] Next question. [laughs] Well, if we got this far into the interview and that's the first ""no comment,"" I think we're doing all right. What's your plan for the morning of Jan. 21? Sleep. Sleep. That's the thing you miss? It's the thing, you know, I say that sleep is overrated. But these are tough jobs, and I'm looking forward to reintroducing myself to my family, spending time with them, maybe reintroducing myself to American culture and reading some books that don't have anything to do with intelligence and national security. Or seeing some movies. I understand that there are still movie theaters out there. So there are some things that I haven't had the opportunity to do, after 36 years or so of being in this profession, one that I absolutely love and cherish. And this is the ultimate capstone of my career. I could never see doing another government job, because no government job can come anywhere close to being director of CIA. What's the first book on your nightstand that you're going to get to? I don't know, I'm going to sort of wander through a bookstore and to see what is out there. I do want to do something that is very different than what I have been doing right now, just from an intellectual stimulation standpoint. Maybe write some fiction. I know that you are a very accomplished author of fiction. Thank you. I have a couple of ideas and, you know, that I would be able to ... Really? Maybe a spy thriller then. Not a spy thriller. It'll be something else. We'll see. I will look forward to reading it. Director Brennan, thank you. Thank you, Mary Louise. And thank you for your interest in national security and these interviews that we've conducted over the years. I presume that this will be the last one that I'll have the opportunity to talk to you as a government official. Thank you. I thank you for your time. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.

npr,"December 23, 2016",Putin Shrugs Off Trump's Tweet On Expanding U.S. Nuclear Capability," Russian President Vladimir Putin downplayed Donald Trump's tweet Thursday calling for the United States to expand its nuclear capabilities. ""There's nothing out of the ordinary here,"" Putin said, since the U.S. president-elect had advocated a stronger military throughout his election campaign. The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes Putin took a deep dive into U.S. politics on Friday during his annual news conference in Moscow, praising Trump and skewering President Obama and Hillary Clinton. During a marathon Q&amp;A; session that lasted almost four hours, reporters kept returning to the accusations of Kremlin interference in the U.S. presidential election. Putin took them on with gusto, at times sounding like a Trump surrogate. ""The current administration and the Democratic Party leadership are trying to blame all their failures on external factors,"" Putin said. The Russian president said he agreed with Trump that anybody — even someone lying on their sofa — could have hacked the Democratic National Committee. The most important thing, according to Putin, is the information that came out of the hack, namely the machinations among top Democrats. America's ""ruling party,"" he said, has clearly forgotten the original meaning of the word ""democratic."" The fact that a growing number of Republicans has a favorable view of Putin shows that a ""significant portion"" of Americans shares the concerns and ""traditional values"" of Russians, Putin said, adding that mutual sympathy could be the basis for closer relations in the future. He took issue with Obama's assertion last week that late Republican President Ronald Reagan ""would roll over in his grave"" because of Putin's popularity in the GOP. On the contrary, Putin said, Reagan would be happy that Republicans are winning everywhere and had Trump, who understood the mood of the people. ""He went all the way, even though only we believed that he would win,"" Putin said to laughter and applause. On Friday, Trump said in a statement that he received ""a very nice letter"" from Putin, adding that ""his thoughts are so correct."" In an indication that he's through with Obama, Putin said it's more likely that great Democrats are turning over in their graves. Unlike President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who united Americans, the outgoing administration divided them, Putin said. Even as he insisted on Russia's inability to sway the U.S. elections, Putin didn't hesitate to criticize the ""archaic nature"" of the Electoral College. What he didn't mention is that Clinton won the popular vote by almost 3 million votes.

npr,"December 23, 2016",Montana May Be Model For Future Medicaid Work Requirement," Ruth McCafferty, who works in Kalispell, Mont., credits the training she got through the state's Medicaid expansion with helping her get a good job. Montana State Senator Ed Buttrey is a no-nonsense businessman from the central part of the state. Like a lot of Republicans, he's not a fan of the Affordable Care Act and its expansion of Medicaid, health insurance for the poor and disabled. ""We didn't want to implement a plan that was another entitlement that just had a bunch of people signing up to get free or cheap or subsidized health care,"" says Buttrey, who represents Great Falls. ""We wanted a plan that said, 'We're going to get you on. We're going to get you healthy. We're going to identify your barriers to employment or better employment, and then we're going to move you off the plan.' "" So Buttrey wrote a Medicaid expansion bill for Montana that linked health coverage to job training. He wanted everyone getting benefits to have to meet with a labor specialist who would help them figure out how to get a job or to get a job that paid better. The goal is to ""make them healthier, get them off social programs, get them off dependence on government, get them into higher wage jobs that have a future that possibly pay benefits, that's a great benefit for the state,"" he says. But so far, federal officials said states can't make participation in a work program mandatory for Medicaid recipients. Montana, instead, had to make its job training component voluntary. Republican leaders across the country have long angled for more state control over Medicaid. The funding comes from both states and the federal government, with the Department of Health and Human Services scrutinizing states' use of the money. In Montana and many other states, most Medicaid funding comes from the federal government. President-elect Trump's administration may let states have more leeway – in fact, Seema Verma, Trump's pick to run the part of HHS that oversees Medicaid, advocated for more state control when she helped expand Medicaid in Indiana. A new administration could open the door for more Medicaid experiments, like the one Buttrey has been pushing for. The feds' rejection of mandatory job training meant Buttrey was barely able to win enough votes in Montana's Republican majority legislature to pass Medicaid expansion last April. How is the Medicaid expansion working in Montana? ""I think it's a success story. I love this."" says Ruth McCafferty. ""I'm the poster child."" She is a 53-year-old single mom from Kalispell, with three kids at home. She lost her job with a lending company last spring, and she had no idea there was job training available when she signed up for Medicaid. She was just focused on finding a way to afford the drugs she needs to control her diabetes and asthma. ""One inhaler that I do is $647,"" she says, bringing her medication costs to about $1,000 a month. After McCafferty got Medicaid, she filled her prescriptions and got free online training to become a mortgage broker. The state even paid for her 400-mile round-trip to Helena to take the broker certification exam. Now the state is paying part of her salary as an apprentice at a local business to make it easier to hire her. ""It's awesome!"" she says. Of the 53,000 Montanans who've signed up for expanded Medicaid, only about 3,000 have signed up for help getting a job. That's in part because the federal government won't allow states to use Medicaid money for it. To set it up here, Buttrey had to cobble together funding from other jobs programs and squeeze $1 million out of a reluctant state legislature. Giving states the flexibility to tie their Medicaid programs to work requirements is an idea that's likely to be popular with the new Congress and Trump administration. But health policy researcher Joan Alker, who runs the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University, warns that it could backfire. ""I think it's great and well worth doing — to link people who might not be aware of existing job training programs or other kinds of work supports that can help them work. What I think is problematic is when this becomes a stick and not a support,"" she says. Alker says many people on Medicaid already have jobs, often low-paying ones that don't offer health insurance. These people often have little time for new training. In Montana, about two-thirds of people on Medicaid are employed. Alker says if people fail to meet a work requirement and then lose health benefits as a result, they'll likely just get sicker and become less able to work.

npr,"December 23, 2016","Trump Tax Proposals Are Terrific, Adviser Arthur Laffer Says"," When you look at Trump's tax proposals, how closely do they match your ideas of what a tax plan should be? ARTHUR LAFFER: I think they are terrific. I think the corporate tax in the U.S. today is not only global in scope, which is a mistake - we have the single highest tax rate in the OECD - and it's discouraging businesses, jobs, output, employment coming to the U.S. It's driving business away through inversions and through formation of companies elsewhere. Dropping that tax rate to 15 percent would have a huge impact on the U.S. economy and would have very little impact, if any, on tax revenues from corporations, from businesses. INSKEEP: So you're making the argument that a tax cut, because it might stimulate economic activity, would actually lead to more government revenue. LAFFER: In this case, yes, I do believe so. And if we lower that tax rate, I think we will have no more inversions, No. 1. INSKEEP: We should remind people, when you say inversions, you're talking about a company moving its corporate headquarters to Ireland or wherever so that they... LAFFER: Yes, thank you. That's exactly what I'm talking about. And No. 2, I think a lot of companies, both U.S. and foreign, will decide to locate their facilities here in the U.S. rather than abroad. INSKEEP: So let me ask you about deficits as part of this picture because when we look at the total Trump tax plan, anybody who's scored this has found that it adds trillions to the federal deficit and to the federal debt over time. How big a disadvantage is that in your view? LAFFER: You know, when you look at Donald Trump's proposals today, what I would do is I would take those proposals - I would take them seriously but not literally. Now, the one I would take literally is the corporate tax, which we talked about. But the ones I would take seriously are reforming the tax codes. If you go to the Brady proposal or the Paul Ryan proposals - now remember, all tax plans have to come out of Ways and Means. INSKEEP: The House tax writing committee, right. LAFFER: Yeah, that's how. And if you look at their proposals if combined with Trump's vision of the world - not literal proposal - I don't think you're going to have any huge increase in deficits on a static basis. INSKEEP: So one more thing here - Steven Mnuchin, the designate to be treasury secretary... LAFFER: Yes. INSKEEP: ...Puts a different cast on all of this because he is saying, recently, that any reductions we have an upper-income taxes will be offset by less deductions so there will be no absolute tax cut for the upper class, people on the top. He says we'll be paying about the same. Are you comfortable with that? LAFFER: Well, yeah. That's what we were talking about earlier. And what I'd like to do is see us get rid of all these deductions, exemptions, exclusions and loopholes and lower the rate dramatically. And you'd create enormous growth in the United States. That's exactly what we need. INSKEEP: Is there a risk when you start lowering tax rates and hoping you will also eliminate deductions that the deductions get defended - they don't actually go away, and you just end up cutting rates and increasing deficits? LAFFER: There's a risk in all policy going forward. But when you look at tax policy, what you really want to do is try to get bipartisan support, like we had under Reagan, with both our sets of tax bills. INSKEEP: Well, that raises one more thing. Republicans in Congress have been openly saying, we want to get rid of Obamacare. We want to replace it with something else, but whatever we do ought to be bipartisan. If it's just one party, it's not sustainable. It doesn't work... LAFFER: That's right. That's why it should be, yes. INSKEEP: Would you say the same thing is true of changing tax policy - if it's not bipartisan... LAFFER: Yes. INSKEEP: ...Just don't do it? LAFFER: Why, you know, you want to make it bipartisan. And you try to convince the others of your logic, and they try to convince you. And hopefully, you can make some ground. Now, I've done some stuff with Al Gore historically. And I'm all for a carbon tax if you were willing to offset it with a 100-percent static (unintelligible), income tax or payroll tax. So is Al. I mean, that's the type of bipartisan stuff I think we should be able to do. But this is... INSKEEP: We better explain what you just said because you're saying that you would favor a carbon tax, which is a way to fight climate change, just so long as it's revenue-neutral. Some other tax should go down. LAFFER: Yeah, an income tax or payroll tax, which is what Al Gore has always suggested whenever he's talked about a carbon tax. I think he's brilliant on this issue. The fear I have with a carbon tax is that if it's a standalone, it'll kill the economy. This is what Congress should be doing - is trying to find common ground. I mean, I think bipartisanship is very important. INSKEEP: Do you think the Republicans in Congress and this president-elect would go along with that, or they would say, actually, that's not very important - we don't even believe it? LAFFER: I don't know. I mean - but I do know I was called by a group of Democrats who are about 50-some members of the House - all Democrats - would love to do something with Trump on the tax codes and reforming them and making them pro-growth as long as they can put in some things like the carbon tax substitution. We need to get together where we have a growth agenda. And I think Trump is very willing to work on a bipartisan basis to get a good growth agenda. And I - and I laud him for all those efforts. INSKEEP: Arthur Laffer, it's been a pleasure. Thanks very much. LAFFER: My pleasure. Thank you. INSKEEP: Arthur Laffer is an adviser to President-elect Donald Trump. Copyright © 2016 NPR.

npr,"December 23, 2016","Trump Conflicts Could Violate The Constitution On Day 1, Lawyers Say"," The president-elect was silent about another thing Gingrich said. He said Trump must address his own business conflicts of interest. The president-elect has yet to explain how he will separate himself from his business. He owns golf courses and buildings, licenses his name to other buildings around the world and owes hundreds of millions of dollars in loans to banks in Germany and China. To get some bipartisan clarity, we've brought back Richard Painter, who was President George W. Bush's top ethics lawyer, and Norman Eisen, who is President Obama's. We'll hear Eisen answer first. What are the laws, again, that apply to the president of the United States? NORMAN EISEN: The same fundamental law that applies to everyone who serves in American government. And that, of course, is the Constitution. And the Constitution prohibits the president from receiving payments from foreign governments. Unless Donald Trump changes course, he will be in violation of the Constitution on day one, hour one and minute one because his businesses in the United States and around the world receive a steady flow of proceeds from foreign governments. Of course... INSKEEP: What are you talking about here? Of course, he's dealing with businesses. Do you mean state-owned firms? Which ones do you mean? EISEN: We need travel no further than a few blocks from the White House, the Trump Hotel. There's been controversy now about whether or not they're pressuring governments to leave other hotels in Washington and come to their hotel. Whether those allegations are proven or not, there can be no question that the Trump Hotel in D.C. is aggressively seeking business from foreign governments. Once Mr. Trump takes the oath of office, that will be a violation of the Constitution. The founders of our country were so concerned about these foreign government gifts - payments - that they actually put a clause in the Constitution. It's called the Emoluments Clause. That's just an 18th-century word for foreign government benefits. INSKEEP: Richard Painter, I want to make sure that we're clear on this because the president-elect has noted that the federal ethics law does not cover the president. He has said, quote, ""the president cannot have a conflict of interest."" You're saying that the Constitution overrides that? RICHARD PAINTER: He's just wrong on that. That's a separate federal-ethics law that we can talk about. But the Emoluments Clause applies to everybody in the government, including the president. And this isn't just involving the hotel. We have foreign state-owned banks that lease space in Trump buildings, loans from the Bank of China, the various Trump businesses. All of that needs to be unwound by January 20, or he needs to sell those businesses. That's the price of public service. INSKEEP: Norm Eisen, I want to come back to you because Mr. Trump has said that what he wants to do is turn his businesses over to his grown children. What's wrong with that? EISEN: Well he's going to be setting himself and his kids and his administration up for scandal after scandal, I think, putting his family at risk of criminal violations, as well. All over the world, we see this. You have government leaders who themselves can't do business. So they appoint - there's even a name for it - the princelings. The kids become the conduit for influence, for business deals, for amassing wealth, whispering in the ear of the government leader. And it leads to corruption inevitably. And the same is going to happen here. There is nothing complicated about what Mr. Trump has to do. He can sign a simple one-page piece of paper - turns over all of his business operations and interests to an independent trustee. Let the trustee worry about the kids. Let the trustee deal with these problems. And let Mr. Trump focus on governing in the way that he promised. INSKEEP: Wait a minute. Trump and his staff have said this is very, very hard - not simple at all. They have said, for example, that blind trust, which I think is what you're describing, is impossible - like turning the businesses over to somebody who would operate them out of the view of the president because the business is a very visible. His name is on buildings. Isn't this really hard? EISEN: Yeah. I heard Mr. Gingrich make this statement on your program. INSKEEP: Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House, a big Trump supporter. OK. EISEN: It is ridiculous. It's simple. You give it to the trustee. And you let the trustee figure out what he should do. Should he get private equity and to refinance? How is he going to deal with the kids and the Trump executives? What kind of walls are going to be set up? Think what a relief it would be to Mr. Trump and to the world if he simply said, look, I've picked the best independent trustee. He's going to worry about all of that. I'm going to worry about governing the country with integrity and draining the swamp. That's simple. INSKEEP: Well let's bring Richard Painter back in because Trump told The New York Times it would be really hard to deal with this because he owns a lot of real estate, which can be very hard to sell. Some of his supporters say he'd have to sell everything in a fire sale. Would he have to conduct a fire sale of his properties? PAINTER: I don't think so. There are ways to bring in private-equity firms and other buyers. There's a liquid market for real estate. Yes, it's complex. And it can't all be done in a day. And then there's some other issues. I mean, there's some buildings the name has to come off of. We cannot have the president's name up on a building in a high-risk zone for terrorism. And that's not a financial conflicts-of-interest issue. It's a simple question of common sense. And the question of who's going to protect that building - if it's a foreign government at its own expense, then we're right back with the Emoluments Clause problem. INSKEEP: Wait a minute. You're saying that if the government of the Philippines, say, or some other country provided extra security for a Trump hotel, that would be benefiting Trump's business. And that would be a violation of the Constitution if he still owns it. PAINTER: It could be. This is the problem. If he's making a profit off having his name on the hotel - but having his name on the hotel requires substantial amounts of money to be spent by the foreign government protecting the hotel without reimbursement from the Trump organization. I would think there would be a serious question of the Emoluments Clause if he owns the hotel. But, you know, I want to emphasize about the role of Congress here, though. I hope the House of Representatives exercises serious oversight. I'm a Republican. I'd like to see Republicans there hopefully rein in some of the spending. But if they cannot exercise oversight over the Trump administration, the voters are going to rebel against that in two years. And I hope, for the sake of the Republican members of the House, that they take their oversight responsibility seriously. We can't have the fox in charge of the chicken coop. INSKEEP: Couple of other things, gentlemen. In the weeks since we've talked, Mr. Trump's children have appeared in more meetings with the president-elect. And world leaders, business leaders, for example - some of them were seen in a meeting with leading tech-industry executives in New York at Trump Tower a number of days ago. Is there anything wrong with that? PAINTER: Well, they need to figure out who's playing on what team. There are going to be those in the Trump family, perhaps Ivanka and her husband Jared, who want to be in the government. And to the extent that can be done consistent with anti-nepotism laws - well, then so be it. But if they're going to be on the government team, they need to play by the government rules. And those going to be running businesses shouldn't be sitting in on official meetings. I'd like to see some clarity as to who's doing what. INSKEEP: Richard Painter was the top ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush. Norman Eisen was the top ethics lawyer for President Obama. Gentlemen, thanks to you both. EISEN: Thanks, Steve. PAINTER: Thank you. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

npr,"December 23, 2016","If Republicans Repeal Health Law, Paying For A Replacement Could Be Tough"," House Speaker Paul Ryan signed legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act on Jan. 7, 2016. President Obama vetoed the bill, but the new administration could open the door for change. Leading Republicans in Congress have vowed that even if they repeal most of the Affordable Care Act early in 2017, a replacement won't hurt those now receiving benefits. Republicans will seek to ensure that ""no one is worse off,"" said House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., in an interview with a Wisconsin newspaper in early December. ""The purpose here is to bring relief to people who are suffering from Obamacare so that they can get something better."" But that may be difficult for one big reason: Republicans have also pledged to repeal the taxes that Democrats used to pay for their health law. Without that money, Republicans will have far less to spend on whatever they opt for as a replacement. ""It will be hard to have comparable coverage if they start with less money,"" Gail Wilensky, a health economist who ran the Medicare and Medicaid programs under President George H.W. Bush, said in an interview. ""Repealing all the ACA's taxes as part of repeal and delay only makes a true replacement harder,"" wrote Loren Adler and Paul Ginsburg of the Brookings Institution in a white paper out Monday. It ""would make it much more difficult to achieve a sustainable replacement plan that provides meaningful coverage without increasing deficits."" The health law's subsidies to individuals buying insurance and the Medicaid expansion are funded by two big pots of money. The first is a series of taxes, including levies on individuals with incomes greater than $200,000, health insurers, makers of medical devices, brand-name drugmakers, people who use tanning salons, and employer plans that are so generous they trigger the much-maligned ""Cadillac Tax."" Some of those measures have not yet taken effect. However, the Congressional Budget Office estimated in early 2016 that repealing those provisions would reduce taxes by an estimated $1 trillion over the decade from 2016-2025. The other big pot of money that funds the benefits in the health law comes from reductions in federal spending for Medicare (and to a lesser extent, Medicaid). Those include trims in the scheduled payments to hospitals, insurance companies and other health care providers, as well as increased premiums for higher-income Medicare beneficiaries. CBO estimated in 2015 that canceling the cuts would boost federal spending by $879 billion from 2016 to 2025. The GOP, in the partial repeal bill that passed in January and was vetoed by President Obama, proposed to cancel the tax increases in the health law, as well as the health premium subsidies and Medicaid expansion. But it would have kept the Medicare and Medicaid payment reductions. Because the benefits that would be repealed cost more than the revenue being lost through the repeal of the taxes, the result would have been net savings to the federal government — to the tune of about $317.5 billion over 10 years, said CBO. But those savings — even if Republicans could find a way to apply them to a new bill — wouldn't be enough to fund the broad expansion of coverage offered under the ACA. If Republicans follow that playbook again, their plans for replacement could be hampered because they will still lose access to tax revenues. That means they cannot fund equivalent benefits unless they find some other source of revenue. Some analysts fear the money may come from more cuts to Medicare and Medicaid. ""Medicare and Medicaid face fundamental threats, perhaps the most since they were established in the 1960s,"" said Edwin Park of the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, in a recent webinar. Republicans in the House, however, have identified one other potential source of funding. ""Our plan caps the open-ended tax break on employer-based premiums,"" said their proposal, called ""A Better Way."" House Republicans say that would be preferable to the Cadillac Tax in the ACA, which is scheduled to go into effect in 2020 and taxes only the most generous plans. But health policy analysts say ending the employer tax break could be even more controversial. Capping the amount of health benefits that workers can accept free of taxes ""would reduce incentives for employers to continue to offer coverage,"" said Georgetown University's Sabrina Corlette. James Klein, president of the American Benefits Council, which represents large employers, said they would look on such a proposal as potentially more damaging to the future of employer-provided insurance than the so-called Cadillac Tax, which his group has lobbied hard against. ""This is not a time one wants to disrupt the employer marketplace,"" Klein said in an interview. ""It seems perplexing to think that if the ACA is going to be repealed, either in large part or altogether, it would be succeeded by a proposal imposing a tax on people who get health coverage from their employer."" Wilensky said that as an economist, getting rid of the tax exclusion for employer-provided health insurance would put her ""and all the other economists in seventh heaven."" Economists have argued for years that having the tax code favor benefits over cash wages encourages overly generous insurance and overuse of health services. But at the same time, she added, ""I am painfully aware of how unpopular my most favored change would be."" Republicans will have one other option if and when they try to replace the ACA's benefits — not paying for them at all, thus adding to the federal deficit. While that sounds unlikely for a party dedicated to fiscal responsibility, it wouldn't be unprecedented. In 2003 the huge Medicare prescription drug law was passed by a Republican Congress — with no specified funding to pay for the benefits.

npr,"December 23, 2016","Radio's Diane Rehm, A Mainstay Of Civil Discourse, Signs Off"," Diane Rehm is wrapping up a public radio career spanning more than four decades and thousands of episodes. Her talk show has originated at Washington, D.C.'s WAMU and is heard by nearly 3 million people across the country weekly on NPR stations. Yet The Diane Rehm Show almost didn't get off the ground. In 1979, Rehm started as a host with a program aimed at homemakers. Several years later, she informed her boss that she had other plans. ""I'm bored. I'm really bored,"" Rehm remembers telling him. ""Unless I can change this show and do politics, do science, do medicine, do everything that's happening in the world, I'm outta here. ... He listened, and he said 'you're right.' "" Reformatted and rebranded as The Diane Rehm Show in 1984, it became a place for policies to get dissected and politicians to get tested.  Last year, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley experienced Rehm's steely civility as he called in from a cellphone en route to the studio.  ""Gov. O'Malley, I must say I'm somewhat surprised that you could not make it here in time as you had promised to,"" she told him on air. ""Ah, well, Diane, you can't believe every promise every politician makes,"" he replied with a twinkle in his voice. O'Malley, in the early stages of his Democratic presidential campaign, then apologized profusely. Rehm did not relent. ""I do expect guests to live up to their promises,"" she told O'Malley.  A low point for Rehm occurred last year during election season. Relying on fabricated Internet reports, she asked Bernie Sanders about his supposed dual American and Israeli citizenship — only he doesn't have dual citizenship. She calls that a chief regret over decades of broadcasting. Rehm's presence on the air was always distinctive. Her inflection and pitch was greatly affected by a neurological voice disorder, called spasmodic dysphonia, that threatened her livelihood. ""It sends an incorrect message to the vocal cords, and I become strangled,"" she explains. Treatment requires a Botox injection into her vocal cords several times a year. The first time Rehm received the injection, she says, she thought her career was over. ""People were so kind and so welcoming,"" she says. ""Now, I'm not saying everybody was, because I had the feeling there were a ton of people who said, 'What in God's name is this woman doing on radio?' "" Among her most frequent nonpolitical guests were the actor and singer Julie Andrews, the author Isabel Allende, and the poet Maya Angelou, who stopped a conversation about her book with this: ""I like you so much, Diane Rehm, and ... so does your audience. And I have a feeling all the time that you and I are best friends.""  The interview took place in 2013 and was their final conversation.   ""You are the kind of best friend everybody would like to have,"" Angelou added. ""You're honest, you're direct, and you're not brutal."" The Diane Rehm Show signs off the air Friday, to be succeeded by Joshua Johnson, whose show, 1A, will be heard on many member stations. Yet Rehm's voice won't disappear. She says she has only listened to a single podcast — once — but she intends to start a podcast of her own, also for WAMU. NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor ",http://www.npr.org/506653136
npr,"December 22, 2016",Trump Team Asks State Dept. To Name Those Working On Gender Equality," The email was acquired and published by The New York Times, which reports: ""Although the wording of the memo is neutral and does not hint at any policy change, it rattled State Department employees, even those at senior levels. Some officials said they feared that the incoming Trump administration was trying to determine what programs were focused on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues, though the memo did not refer to them."" The team also asked the department offices to ""note positions whose primary functions are to promote such issues"" and to highlight any funds for the current financial year that are ""already allocated to such programs and activities."" Affirming the Times' characterization of the email's reception, The Los Angeles Times quotes a senior State Department official who said, ""People are freaked out."" Update 9 a.m. ET Friday: Trump Team's Response In a statement about the request, the Trump transition team says: ""President-elect Trump will ensure the rights of women across the world are valued and protected. To help fulfill this promise, the transition team inquired about existing programs at the State department that helps foster gender equality, ends gender-based violence, and promotes economic and political participation—finding ways to improve them, along with hundreds of other requests."" Our original post continues: The topic also came up at Thursday's daily State Department briefing — but NPR's Michele Kelemen says it seemed that spokesman John Kirby mainly sought to calm nerves about the request. In a report for our Newscast unit, Michele quotes Kirby as saying, ""To the degree that there is interest in the way that we have approached pursuing gender equality and human rights around the world by the transition team, we will certainly provide them the context, the information that is appropriate for them to make their own decisions going forward."" Kirby acknowledged that there could be ""anxiety"" at a time of transition, but he refused to go into details about the email or to verify the accuracy of the leaked documents. Addressing his agency's approach to gender issues, Kirby told a reporter, ""Obviously, gender equality issues here at the Department of State are a priority. Secretary Kerry has made them a priority; Secretary Clinton before him made it a priority, and it remains one for us here."" Kirby also suggested that the State Department might balk at naming its employees who have worked on those priorities, saying that in a hypothetical case, ""if there were issue-specific names requested, obviously that would be of concern to us and it would not be the kind of information that we would deem to be appropriate to be passed along."" Shortly after the transition team's email became public, the Twitter account of the State Department's Political-Military Affairs bureau posted a note of support for the National Action Plan on Women, Peace, &amp; Security — a program that was celebrated in a State Department tweet Wednesday, as the agency marked five years since the plan was introduced by President Obama. In response to reports about the memo, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., who serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, issued a statement saying in part: ""In light of previous requests made by the Trump transition team, today's report that the incoming administration is requesting all information related to State Department programs that promote gender equality is concerning and the transition team should clarify their intent.... Women and girls' equality is transformative for communities and economies, and the existing State Department programs have achieved great successes to advance education access for girls, protect women from trafficking, end child marriage, and combat gender-based violence."" The Trump team's request, which set a deadline of Wednesday afternoon to produce the lists, comes one week after the Energy Department rebuffed a request from Trump's transition team to name employees working on climate change. As NPR's Brakkton Booker has reported, the Trump team's 74-point questionnaire on climate change ""raised fears among civil rights lawyers specializing in federal worker whistleblower protections, who say the incoming administration is at a minimum trying to influence or limit the research."" In refusing the Trump team's request, the Energy Department said many of its staff members were ""unsettled"" by the gesture, stating that while it would share any information that was already public, it would not produce a list of individual names. Early last week, Trump said he is nominating Exxon Mobil Chairman and CEO Rex Tillerson to lead the State Department.

npr,"December 22, 2016",White House Moves To Block Creation Of Muslim Registry," President Obama has made it harder for his successor to deliver on a campaign proposal. Donald Trump said he wanted to register Muslims in the U.S. As president, he could have used an existing database. It was launched after 9/11 but later suspended. Well, today the Obama administration did away with the regulations that made that program possible. NPR's Tom Gjelten reports. TOM GJELTEN, BYLINE: In the weeks after 9/11, with the nation worried about another terrorist attack, the George W. Bush administration required men from 24 Muslim countries to register with the government when they arrived, while they were here and again when they left. It was the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System, NSEERS. Banafsheh Akhlaghi, a human rights lawyer, represented many of the men during the registration process, standing alongside as federal agents asked them questions. BANAFSHEH AKHLAGHI: Do you eat halal meat? What was the last movie that you watched? When do you go to mosque? Which mosque do you go to? GJELTEN: The Obama administration suspended the program after concluding the same information was being collected through other database programs. Counterterrorism experts said it alienated many patriotic Muslims and did not produce worthwhile leads. But the program was not abolished, and with the stroke of his pen, a president Donald Trump could have reinstated it. JONATHAN TURLEY: NSEERS was basically an empty building that the Trump administration could have moved right into. GJELTEN: Jonathan Turley, who specializes in national security law at George Washington University, says NSEERS could have served Trump's purposes had he wanted to reregister Muslims. By canceling the NSEERS regulations, the Obama administration made that impossible. TURLEY: What they did is they just bulldozed that building. So they have to build another one. GJELTEN: Meaning the Trump team would have to write and publish new regulations for a new program - totally doable, Turley says, but there'd have to be an opportunity for public comment, and that could be time-consuming. TURLEY: You have a lot of advocacy groups on both sides that weight in, suggest changes. Those changes have to be considered. And then the agency has to come back and explain why the final regulations look the way they do. GJELTEN: Among those who would speak out - the American Civil Liberties Union. Hina Shamsi is the national security director there. HINA SHAMSI: We would absolutely oppose this program. And as we have said, if this form of discriminatory registry is put in place, we stand ready to sue and to challenge it. GJELTEN: A new registry could bring out law-abiding Muslims. But human rights lawyer Banafsheh Akhlaghi says it would probably not reveal the would-be terrorists the government should be worried about. AKHLAGHI: They aren't going to voluntarily come into a federal building, give you their fingerprints, give you their name and their identity and allow you to take photographs of them. The good guys do that. GJELTEN: Asked today what effect the cancellation of the NSEERS regulations would have, Trump transition spokesman Jason Miller said the incoming administration would deal with it.

npr,"December 22, 2016",Senators Call For Select Committee To Investigate Russian Hacking," There are differences over what kind of investigation by what kind of committee. Joining us now to talk about those differences is one of the Democratic senators who's been at the forefront of the call for an investigation by a select committee, Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island. Welcome to the program. JACK REED: Thank you, Robert. SIEGEL: The Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said that existing committees - he mentioned the Intelligence Committee - can handle this job. You're on that committee as well as being the ranking Democrat on Armed Services. Why can't a standing committee do the job just as well? REED: Well, the major issue is that so many of these aspects of cybersecurity cut across committee lines. And we have to have a comprehensive approach to this problem that will lead to comprehensive legislation. The Intelligence Committee deals with issues - principally foreign intelligence. The Armed Service Committee deals with intelligence issues related to military. But there's the Homeland Security Department. There's - the banking regulators have issues of banking security and cyber-intrusion. So if we're going to do a job that is both comprehensive and will lead to effective legislation, a select committee, not business as usual, will be the best way to go. SIEGEL: But this distinction between a select committee investigation that you support and an investigation by the Intelligence Committee or the Armed Services Committee - obviously this is a meaningful difference to you. It sounds to lots of people out there in the country to be somewhere in the weeds. What is something that a select committee could do that, say, the Intelligence Committee could not do? REED: Well, first, the select committee will operate as much as possible in public, which is not the usual routine of an intelligence committee. And public hearings are important. You know, we have to protect sources and methods of intelligence information. But the public has to know. First of all, they have to know that we're doing something about this. This is an unprecedented intrusion into our electoral process which, if unchecked, will continue. In fact, it will probably get worse. And the fundamental foundation of this country is faith in elections that are the result of voters and result of debate and discussion, not insinuation and fake news and leaked reports. We have to restore that confidence. And a public select committee able to transcend jurisdictional boundaries, able to call witnesses from the law enforcement community, the judiciary, the financial services - that I think would be very, very powerful and very effective. SIEGEL: You've just expressed your sense of how big a problem this is. Is there bipartisan consensus in the Senate that it indeed is that serious and that grave an issue, or should we infer from Senator McConnell's remarks that he may not agree with you? REED: This is not a partisan issue. In fact, we very clearly want to make it a nonpartisan issue. This is an issue about the security of the United States and the American people. Senator McCain is prepared on the Armed Services Committee to structure a committee - a subcommittee that will look at cyber issues. But again, we'll run into limitations if we what we don't have - appropriate jurisdiction over some very important elements of our cyber-security system. SIEGEL: How important to the cause of an investigation is President-elect Trump saying that it's important, which he is not? REED: I think it is absolutely critical. And I think one reason it's critical is because the specter of Russian involvement in the election - if it's not clearly analyzed - and there is a sense that we know exactly the dimensions - we know what was done; we know why it was done - will be something that will cloud any relationship with the Russians going forward. There will always be the question coming up. Is the administration doing this because it's the right thing to do or they're doing it because there's something we don't know? SIEGEL: Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, thanks for talking with us. REED: Thank you, Robert. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"December 22, 2016",Database Tracks History Of U.S. Meddling In Foreign Elections," DOV LEVIN: One example of that was our intervention in Serbia, Yugoslavia in the 2000 election there. Slobodan Milosevic was running for re-election, and we didn't want him to stay in power there due to his tendency, you know, to disrupts the Balkans and his human rights violations. So we intervened in various ways for the opposition candidate, Vojislav Kostunica. And we gave funding to the opposition, and we gave them training and campaigning aide. And according to my estimate, that assistance was crucial in enabling the opposition to win. SHAPIRO: How often are these interventions public versus covert? LEVIN: Well, it's - basically there's about - one-third of them are public, and two-third of them are covert. In other words, they're not known to the voters in the target before the election. SHAPIRO: Your count does not include coups, attempts at regime change. It sounds like depending on the definitions, the tally could actually be much higher. LEVIN: Well, you're right. I don't count and discount covert coup d'etats like the United States did in Iran in 1953 or in Guatemala in 1954. I only took when the United States is trying directly to influence an election for one of the sides. Other types of interventions - I don't discuss. But if we would include those, then of course the number could be larger, yeah. SHAPIRO: How often do other countries like Russia, for example, try to alter the outcome of elections as compared to the United States? LEVIN: Well, for my dataset, the United States is the most common user of this technique. Russia or the Soviet Union since 1945 has used it half as much. My estimate has been 36 cases between 1946 to 2000. We know also that the Chinese have used this technique and the Venezuelans when the late Hugo Chavez was still in power in Venezuela and other countries. SHAPIRO: The U.S. is arguably more vocal than any other country about trying to promote democracy and democratic values around the world. Does this strike you as conflicting with that message? LEVIN: It depends upon if we are assisting pro-democratic side - could be like in the case of Slobodan Milosevic that I talked about earlier. I believe that that could be helpful for democracy. If it helps less-nicer candidates or parties, then naturally it can be less helpful. SHAPIRO: Obviously your examination of 20th century attempts to influence elections does not involve hacking because computers were not widespread until recently. LEVIN: Yeah. SHAPIRO: In your view, is technology - the way that we saw in the November election - dramatically changing the game? Or is this just the latest evolution of an effort that has always used whatever tools are available? LEVIN: I would say it's more the latter. I mean the Russians or the Soviets before unfrequently did these type of intervention, just, you know, without the cyber-hacking tools - you know, the old style people meeting in the park in secret giving out and getting information and things like that, so to speak. SHAPIRO: Dov Levin is with the Institute for Politics and Strategy at Carnegie Mellon University. Thanks for joining us. LEVIN: Thank you very much. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"December 22, 2016","As President, Trump Will Appoint Labor Board That Regulates His Hotels"," Like other business owners, President-elect Donald Trump has often had a strained relationship with labor unions, sometimes resulting in regulatory disputes and legal battles. Unlike the others, Trump will soon get to appoint the people who run the agency that hears many of those disputes, the National Labor Relations Board. ""We have never seen a situation like this in the 81-year history of the board, where the president who appoints parties has had a financial interest in a matter coming before the board,"" says William Gould, former NLRB chairman and professor emeritus at Stanford Law School. As president, Trump will be able to name three of the five members of the NLRB, and after next year, he will also get to appoint the all-important general counsel, who decides which cases are heard by the board. Trump is familiar with the agency already. Like other real estate developers, he has a history of NLRB complaints over labor practices, including some that are still pending. One of the most prominent cases occurred this year, when employees of the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas sought to become members of the Culinary Workers Union. Trump fought the effort at the NLRB, and when he lost he appealed the board's decision in federal court. The union retaliated by organizing a boycott of Trump properties. ""The Culinary Union has fought against billionaires before,"" says union spokeswoman Bethany Khan. ""But we've never fought against somebody who was running to become president of the United States of America, and that put us in a complicated position."" On Wednesday, the union announced that it had reached a settlement with Trump at the Las Vegas hotel and at a separate hotel in Washington, D.C. Trump agreed to let the workers join the union and essentially gave them the same wages and benefits enjoyed by other hotel workers. The decision to settle allows Trump to put behind him a case that threatened to damage him politically. As a candidate Trump actively portrayed himself as a champion of working people, and the agreement underscores the delicate dance he will need to do to keep their support. ""Our hope is that he understands that you can be pro-worker without promoting and expanding the powers the government has given to organized labor,"" says Patrick Semmens, vice president of the National Right to Work Foundation, which opposes compulsory unionization. Trump deserves some credit for attempting to put the union dispute behind him, says ethics advocate Meredith McGehee of Issue One, a nonpartisan advocacy group that seeks to reduce the influence of money in politics and government. But Trump needs to go a lot further to address the many conflicts of interest posed by his vast business interests, McGehee says. ""It's really important to keep your eye on the ball, in terms of how he's going to deal with these conflicts of interest, whether or not he's going to set up the blind trust and show the American people that their interests are first, not his family's or his business interests are first,"" she says.

Welcome to the program. ROY COOPER: Thank you, Ari. Glad to be with you. SHAPIRO: Now, the deal was that the city of Charlotte would repeal its gay rights protection measure, and then the state would repeal HB2, the so-called bathroom bill. Charlotte says it upheld its end of the bargain passing a repeal and then another. Why do you think the legislature failed to keep its part of the deal? COOPER: What happened is that the Republican caucuses buckled on the Republican leaders. And the frustrating thing is that if they had simply put the legislation out on the floor for a vote, it would have passed with the requisite Democrats and Republicans who were for this voting together. But we know that this is costing us, and we've got to fix it. SHAPIRO: As you mentioned, there's real economic harm from this bill. There have been boycotts. Big companies have decided not to expand in North Carolina. As long as this law is in place, how do you plan to address the ongoing economic harm that it's doing to the state's economy? COOPER: First, I'm telling businesses that this governor's election was the first step. So... SHAPIRO: But they weren't boycotting the governor. They were boycotting the state because of House Bill 2, which is still in effect. COOPER: The governor was the start of House bill 2. I'm going to argue to businesses and others that you still need to come to North Carolina. You need to expand. You need to bring your sporting events and entertainment events here. But when you come, help me repeal House Bill 2. Help me make sure that our laws reflect North Carolinians and who we really are. SHAPIRO: I want to ask more broadly about your ability to work with the legislature. Last week of course Republicans passed this sweeping measure to curb your power. It made your cabinet subject to legislative approval. It cut your political appointees from the 1,500 that your predecessor had down to 425 people, lots of other changes that advantage Republicans. You've said that you'll challenge this in court, but how are you going to govern with a legislature that is so determined to put up roadblocks in your way? COOPER: First, I'm going to make sure that I continue to work with them in areas where we can work together. For example, as we were fighting about these issues, at the same time, we were negotiating on House Bill 2. I think... SHAPIRO: I'm sorry, but if House Bill 2 is your example of where you can work together, last night seems to indicate... COOPER: Well... SHAPIRO: ...The contrary. COOPER: But, Ari, they agreed with me. They ended up having a revolt in their caucus. But the point of the matter is - is that we were talking about this, and we were working on an agreement even with the storm of the other issues. I believe that there are Republicans in the legislature who do want to raise our teacher pay to at least the national average. They want to work with me on bringing good jobs to North Carolina. I'm going to be... SHAPIRO: I don't want to sound rude, but isn't that a little naive in light of what the legislature... COOPER: No. SHAPIRO: ...Has been doing for the last two weeks? COOPER: No, look; I'm going to fight them toe-to-toe on issues we disagree with, that if there are areas where we can work together and we can find agreement, I will. And I think that's the kind of leadership that people want our elected officials to show. SHAPIRO: Over the last year, North Carolina has gained a national reputation as a place of political mud wrestling and chaos. Is that a reputation that you think you can turn around? COOPER: Sure we can. We have an incredible foundation. We have some of the best universities in the country. We have incredible tourism. SHAPIRO: Sounds like you're saying just ignore the politics. COOPER: Yeah, you have to because we're a great state. There are good things going on. When people move here, they don't want to leave. What we have to do is fix the politics. And I'm ready to do that. SHAPIRO: Roy Cooper, governor-elect of North Carolina, thank you for joining us. COOPER: Thank you, Ari. I appreciate it. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"December 22, 2016",Still Puzzled By The Election? Authors Prescribe Fiction For Better Understanding," Even after the Electoral College officially made Donald Trump our next president, a lot of Americans are still wondering how it happened. In part, working-class anger is said to have fueled Trump's victory; and to understand where that anger is coming from, some people are turning to books. Works of nonfiction, like the J.D. Vance's Hillbilly Elegy, are shooting to the top of best-seller lists, and Daniel Halpern, the publisher of Ecco books, is already fielding book proposals about the election and Trump's presidency. So far, they've all been nonfiction, but fiction can also help explain how we got here. Fiction may take longer to write, but it also goes deeper. According to Halpern, it ""gets into the bloodstream."" ""I think we read a novel in a very different way than we read a book of nonfiction,"" he says. ""... It can explain things in a way that just the facts cannot do."" One of Halpern's authors, Jennifer Haigh, has written three novels about a fictional version of her hometown in Pennsylvania's coal country. She says, ""I write about this region I have great love for, and I love this region the way I love family. That is to say: It delights me and also infuriates me and breaks my heart."" Haigh herself is still trying to sort out her own feelings about the election. She's unhappy her home state went for Trump, but she also sees how people in cities like Boston, where she lives now, have the wrong idea about people who live in coal country. These are not gullible people; they're, in fact, deeply cynical people who have been through generational hardship. Jennifer Haigh ""I take issue with the portrait of these people as gullible rubes who've been taken in by a slick salesman,"" she says. ""These are not gullible people; they're, in fact, deeply cynical people who have been through generational hardship."" Haigh writes about that generational hardship in her most recent novel, Heat and Light. It's about what happens when fracking comes to what used to be coal country, but she says it's also about this country's cultural divide: ""differences between urban culture and rural culture, and differences between highly educated people and less educated people, and differences of class. And all of that is the crux of that novel. And it really is, I think, central to our current moment."" Author Nickolas Butler lives in rural Wisconsin. He says, ""Anger isn't something that is solely a rural, American, white guy emotion."" His new novel, The Hearts of Men (March 2017), is all about being a good man. He wrote it, in part, during the long, divisive presidential campaign. He says the hostile political rhetoric inspired him to include some scenes where a single mom, Rachel, gets caught up in a discussion with a group of men — ""angry, white, rural men."" ""She's trying to have a political conversation, trying to understand where this anger is coming from,"" Butler explains. ""And, you know, I think a lot of those characters are regurgitating what they see on social media or AM radio. They're being stoked."" Butler says he included that heated discussion because he wants readers to understand both sides. ""It's very important to me that they identify with this Rachel character and feel some sort of empathy with her, but just as much to try and complicate the characters that she doesn't understand. What are their jobs? How did they get here? What's their education look like?"" Jennifer Haigh says seeing life from different perspectives is exactly what writing and reading novels is all about. She calls it ""extreme empathy."" ""It's really the best technology we have to get inside another person's mind,"" she says. ""There is no better way to see through somebody else's eyes than by reading fiction. So I think in a moment like right now, after we've just experienced this very divisive election, which seems to me like the ultimate failure of empathy, that now more than ever it's important for us to read searchingly, to read about people who are nothing like ourselves."" (She and Butler recommend specific books below.) If there aren't any black folks in your small town, if there aren't any Latino people in your small town or First Nations people, I hope you're getting out and reading their books, reading their art. Nickolas Butler Butler says nonfiction is great, and he plans to read a lot of it in the coming months, but fiction can touch an emotional nerve in a way that nonfiction can't. ""If there aren't any black folks in your small town, if there aren't any Latino people in your small town or First Nations people, I hope you're getting out and reading their books, reading their art,"" he says. ""And I think, likewise, if you're, you know, sitting in a cafe in Brooklyn and you're scratching your head trying to figure out why it is that a person can start walking in Florida and get all the way to Idaho without touching a blue county, maybe you should read something that's coming out of that part of the world."" Butler knows a lot of people can't afford to buy a brand new hardcover book, but he says there's always the library — and that's open to everyone.

npr,"December 22, 2016",Trump And Gingrich Disagree On That Whole Swamp-Draining Thing," Among them was Trump's promise to ""drain the swamp."" The phrase became a popular chant at his campaign rallies, shorthand for ""out with the corrupt Washington insiders; in with the new."" Apparently, though, Gingrich interpreted this rhetoric more as a gimmicky catchphrase than as a literal promise. Here's what he told Martin during the NPR interview, referring to Trump: ""I'm told he now just disclaims that. He now says it was cute, but he doesn't want to use it anymore. ... I'd written what I thought was a very cute tweet about 'the alligators are complaining,' and somebody wrote back and said they were tired of hearing this stuff. ... ""I've noticed on a couple of fronts, like people chanting, 'Lock her up,' that he's in a different role now and maybe he feels that as president, as the next president of the United States, that he should be marginally more dignified than talking about alligators in swamps. I personally ... as a sense of humor, like the alligator and swamp language. ... I think it vividly illustrates the problem, because all the people in this city who are the alligators are going to hate the swamp being drained. And there's going to be constant fighting over it. But, you know, he is my leader and if he decides to drop the swamp and the alligator, I will drop the swamp and the alligator."" Trump, though, apparently disagreed with Gingrich's interpretation of events. The president-elect took to his favorite medium to set the record straight, tweeting Thursday morning that ""Someone incorrectly stated that the phrase 'DRAIN THE SWAMP' was no longer being used by me. Actually, we will always be trying to DTS."" Someone incorrectly stated that the phrase ""DRAIN THE SWAMP"" was no longer being used by me. Actually, we will always be trying to DTS. The ""someone"" Trump was referring to is not exactly subtle, and about 20 minutes later, Gingrich walked his statement back with a tweet and video statement. ""I want to report that I made a big boo-boo,"" Gingrich said in the video. ""I talked this morning with President-elect Donald Trump, and he reminded me he likes draining the swamp."" ""Draining the swamp is in,"" he added, addressing his viewers directly. ""And you're going to get to be part of it."" I goofed. Draining the swamp is in, @realDonaldTrump is going to do it, and the alligators should be worried. #DTS https://t.co/nCHs61gpve pic.twitter.com/OCO7eaSKvk Perhaps Gingrich's reluctance to accept the reportedly impending swamp-draining stems from the fact that having served in Congress for 20 years, he is pretty much the textbook definition of one of those ""alligators"" that Trump is hoping to oust. Gingrich's confusion over the swamp debate is understandable: Trump himself has said that he doesn't even like the phrase. ""I didn't like the expression 'Drain the swamp in Washington,' "" Trump said at an October rally in North Carolina. But when he tried it out on the campaign trail, he said, ""the place went crazy"" and the chant is now ""trending all over the world."" And with a Cabinet that includes several billionaires and longtime Washington players, Trump's actions aren't matching up with his rhetoric. Regardless, it seems the president-elect is sticking with the slogan for the time being. If this latest Twitter kerfuffle is an indicator of anything, it's that even some of Trump's closest allies, like Gingrich, aren't sure of what Trump plans to do once he's in the White House.

npr,"December 22, 2016","Facing Criticism, Eric Trump Will Stop Actively Fundraising For His Foundation"," In the midst of multiple fundraising attempts that raised questions about whether the Trump family is selling the promise of personal access to the highest bidder, Eric Trump says he will stop directly raising money for his personal charity. ""As unfortunate as it is, I understand the quagmire,"" Trump told the New York Times. ""It's an extremely sad day when doing the right thing isn't the right thing,"" Trump told the Associated Press in a separate interview. The Eric Trump Foundation raises money for childhood cancer research and treatment. According to its website, it has ""donated and pledged nearly $30 million"" to the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Trump's decision follows two separate fundraising attempts that were scuttled after they became public. Trump's foundation recently offered donors a chance to have coffee with his sister Ivanka Trump, who is expected to play a formal or informal role in President-elect Donald Trump's administration. The foundation eventually canceled that auction. But days later, a separate group, the Opening Day Foundation, offered donors a chance to go hunting or fishing with Eric and Donald Trump Jr. The cost: contributions of $500,000 or $1 million. The Trump transition team distanced itself from these offers. Spokeswoman Hope Hicks said Trump's sons ""are not involved in any capacity,"" despite the fact they are both listed as directors in the nonprofit group's filings. The fundraising attempts raised ethical questions because they appeared to offer direct access to members of the president-elect's inner circle in exchange for donations. Trump regularly criticized the Clinton Foundation for offering that sort of quid pro quo access to people seeking to influence Hillary Clinton while she ran the State Department. ""It's impossible to figure out where the Clinton Foundation ends and the State Department begins,"" Trump said in August. ""It is now abundantly clear that the Clintons set up a business to profit from public office. They sold access and specific actions by and to them for money."" Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway seemed to share Eric Trump's frustration with the wave of ethical criticism the fundraising has generated. ""The idea that these folks are trying to help people in need and those people are going to suffer now because folks are pointing out what they think to be improprieties, I didn't say I necessarily agree,"" Conway told CNN Thursday morning. ""I just think that they will always do the right thing. I know them well."" While Eric Trump's decision may remove one ethical ""quagmire,"" as he put it, another remains: the question of who will run the Trump Organization and how Donald Trump will, or won't, separate himself from his personal businesses while serving as president. Trump promised to hold a news conference on Dec. 15 to detail his promise to turn over control of his businesses to his children. But the news conference has been delayed, and the Trump transition has not provided any details about what sort of arrangement the president-elect will seek to address conflict-of-interest questions. The U.S. Office of Government Ethics is recommending that Trump completely divest himself from his companies. ""Transferring operational control of a company to one's children would not constitute the establishment of a qualified blind trust, nor would it eliminate conflicts of interest,"" the office's director wrote in a letter to the president-elect.

npr,"December 22, 2016",Trump White House Will Look (And Sound) A Lot Like The Trump Campaign," President-elect Donald Trump is rounding out his White House team — installing several trusted campaign advisers to senior West Wing positions. Kellyanne Conway will serve as counselor to the president, the transition team announced on Thursday. Sean Spicer will be press secretary, and Jason Miller has been named director of communications. Conway was the third and final manager of the successful Trump campaign. She often served as an on-camera spokeswoman for Trump and is credited with bringing much-needed discipline to both the campaign's message and the candidate himself. ""She is a tireless and tenacious advocate of my agenda and has amazing insights on how to effectively communicate our message,"" Trump said in a statement. ""I am pleased that she will be part of my senior team in the West Wing."" Spicer, a former spokesman for the Republican National Committee, will also have a prominent role as press secretary and public face of the new administration. Campaign veterans Miller, Hope Hicks and Dan Scavino will follow Trump to the White House as well. There had been some question about whether Conway would take a job in the administration. She has spoken openly about the challenge of balancing such a job with raising four children, and suggested she might prefer to serve the incoming president from outside the administration. ""I know this will be a very family friendly West Wing and White House,"" Conway told Fox News this morning. ""The gravity and the responsibility of serving at a senior level for the president of the United States — it's difficult to pass that up."" She joked that three of her children are on board with the move, but her 12 year old daughter is resistant. ""When you're a pollster and you have 75 percent agreement on anything, you're really excited,"" Conway said. Thus far, Conway is the highest-ranking woman Trump has named to his White House staff, serving alongside Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and chief strategist Steve Bannon. ""I am humbled and honored to play a role in helping transform the movement [Trump] has led into a real agenda of action and results,"" Conway said in a statement. A veteran GOP pollster, Conway had previously worked with Newt Gingrich and Vice President-elect Mike Pence. NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor ",http://www.npr.org/506563689
npr,"December 22, 2016",'Dawn Of A New Unified Republican Government' Coming In 2017," Just before House Republicans re-elected Paul Ryan as their speaker, the Wisconsin Republican made a bold proclamation. ""Welcome to the dawn of a new unified Republican government,"" Ryan told reporters one week after Election Day. ""This will be a government focused on turning President-elect Trump's victory into real progress for the American people."" Ryan continued: ""If we are going to put our country back on the right track, we have got to be bold, and we have to go big."" That ""be bold, go big"" agenda is still in its early planning stages, but Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and incoming President Donald Trump have outlined plans to repeal and replace Obamacare, overhaul the federal tax code, slash federal regulations, invest in infrastructure projects and seal the U.S.-Mexico border. All told, it's a legislative program that would affect every single person and business in America. A lot can get done in the first two years Recent history is on the GOP's side. When the White House and Congress have been controlled by the same party, Washington has produced some of the most sweeping — albeit politically polarizing — legislation aimed at shifting the political trajectory of the nation toward the cause of the party in power. In particular, the first two-year congressional session of a new administration — when public approval is generally at its highest for the incoming president — has produced some recent presidents' most memorable legislative imprints. President Obama's health care law and Wall Street overhaul both passed in 2010 under Democratic control and along party lines. President George W. Bush signed the No Child Left Behind education law and the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act into law and enacted a round of tax cuts, as well as legislation that created the Department of Homeland Security after the Sept. 11 attacks in his first two years in the Oval Office. (Senate control flipped back and forth in 2001 and 2002 due to the defection of Sen. Jim Jeffords of Vermont from the GOP, but Republicans controlled Congress for the majority of Bush's first term in office.) President Bill Clinton signed the Family Medical Leave Act, gun-control legislation, including an assault weapons ban, and legislation to prevent and prosecute violence toward women before Democrats lost control of Congress in the 1994 wave election. ""Put up and show up"" McConnell has already outlined Republicans' plans to take aim at Obamacare and initiate an overhaul of the tax code in 2017. They also want to use the same budget rules that were used in the past to enact Bush's tax cuts and Obama's health care bill, because certain budget bills can't be filibustered in the Senate. ""The two biggest impediments to growth in our country are over-regulation and the tax structure,"" McConnell said. ""And the president-elect seems to be committed to addressing both of those, and the Republican majorities in the House and Senate are as well."" Incoming White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus told conservative talk-radio host Hugh Hewitt that the first nine months of 2017 will be ""consumed"" by health care and tax legislative pushes. ""Now, it's time for being in the majority,"" Priebus said, ""and I can tell you President-elect Trump is going to lead the way to put up and show up."" Democrats are skeptical Republicans will go through with it. Despite years of unanimous opposition to the law, the GOP has never found consensus on how to replace it. ""They don't know what to do,"" incoming Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters before Congress adjourned for the year. ""They have nothing to put in its place and, believe me, just repealing Obamacare, even though they have nothing to put in its place and saying they'll do it sometime down the road, will cause huge calamity from one end of America to the other."" Retiring Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid warned Republicans against dismantling the health care law. ""It will lead you into a quagmire that will cause pain for millions of Americans and bedevil you for the next four years,"" he wrote in a New York Times opinion piece. Is a Medicare overhaul coming? Democrats like Reid and Schumer believe Republicans have misinterpreted the results of the 2016 election, with Trump claiming a mandate despite losing the popular vote and entering office with historically high negative ratings. Many Democrats say GOP efforts to dismantle Obamacare will hurt the party in the same way Bush's 2005 push to overhaul Social Security damaged the party and played a role in the Democratic takeover of Congress in 2006. ""We had a plan. We stuck with it. It was unified, strategic and unwavering,"" said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., of the 2005 entitlement fight. Pelosi said Democrats won that legislative fight despite Bush enjoying high approval ratings at the time. That fight provides the blueprint Democrats are expected to follow next year to defend Obamacare and, potentially, GOP efforts to reshape Medicare. Ryan has long been a proponent of overhauling Medicare for future retirees from a guaranteed benefit to a premium support system in which seniors are given subsidies to purchase health insurance from the private market. Ryan will have a powerful ally next year: Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., Trump's nominee for Health and Human Services Secretary, shares Ryan's view on Medicare. But old rules and battle lines are unreliable future predictors for a Trump administration. At the risk of understatement, the incoming president has succeeded by defying political norms with a brand that appeals to the older, white voters that Democrats used to be able to rely on to scare Republicans away from touching entitlement programs. The ""Trump Wing"" has the upper hand among Republicans The Republican Party also remains philosophically divided between the traditional, interventionist, fiscal hawk ""Ryan Wing"" and the populist, isolationist ""Trump Wing"" of the party. Early signals point to the Trump Wing having the upper hand at the start. When Trump intervened with Indiana-based Carrier Corp. to pressure the company to remain in the U.S., Ryan, a staunch free-market conservative, applauded. ""Well, I'm pretty happy that we're keeping jobs in America, aren't you?"" Ryan said. Notably, one of the few voices of opposition to Trump was former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin — an icon of the Tea Party movement — who called out the Carrier intervention as crony capitalism. It barely made a ripple. Another sign the Trump Wing of the party is ascendant: Ryan — long described as a rising star in the party — was booed at a Trump political rally in his home state of Wisconsin. Trump came to his defense. ""[Ryan] has been terrific and, you know, honestly, he is like a fine wine. Every day goes by I get to appreciate his genius more and more,"" Trump said, before adding a vaguely threatening disclaimer: ""Now, if he ever goes against me, I'm not going to say that."" It should be noted: Trump doesn't drink. ""I'm tired of divided government"" Ryan understands that 2017 is the best chance he will have in his political career so far to advance the causes he cares about. He recently discussed his discontent with divided government, which Washington has been operating under for the the past six years, a period that largely has been defined by polarization and obstruction, shutdown battles and ideological intransigence. ""I'm tired of divided government. It doesn't work very well,"" Ryan lamented a week prior to Election Day. ""We've gotten some good things done. But the big things — poverty, the debt crisis, the economy, health care — these things are stuck in divided government, and that's why we think a unified Republican government's the way to go."" Up close, Congress has not been as unproductive as the public believes. Major legislation affecting health care, highways, public education and taxes has worked its way through the legislative process and made it to Obama's desk these past six years. One of the president's last acts was signing a sweeping $6.3 billion biomedical research bill that, among other ambitious goals, advances the cause of finding a cure for cancer. But the big, ideological battles over the size and scope of government have gone unsettled. Next year, Republicans will have their best chance in more than a decade to win the next chapter in that never-ending struggle and, maybe, redefine what it means to be a Republican in the Trump era.

npr,"December 22, 2016","President Trump Will Have An Even Bigger Impact On Palm Beach, Fla."," Days after he was elected president, attorneys for Donald Trump had some good news for officials in Florida's Palm Beach County. Trump had decided to drop a $100 million lawsuit against the county for allowing airline flights over his ocean front Mar-a-Lago estate. That was just the latest in a long series of court battles Trump has waged against local governments in Palm Beach. NPR's Greg Allen reports that, as president, Trump will have an even bigger effect on the exclusive community he calls his second home. GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: Last month after the presidential election, Palm Beach County Commissioner Steven Abrams had a recommendation for the county mayor. She should write a letter congratulating the winner, Palm Beach resident Donald Trump. Here's Abrams, a Republican. STEVEN ABRAMS: As one reporter said, the county mayor, after I mentioned it, looked like she had bitten into a lemon. ALLEN: Congratulating the new president on his victory, especially one who's a resident and a taxpayer, should be pro forma for local politicians, a routine matter done out of politeness. The letter was written, but the relationship between Trump and Palm Beach County has been anything but routine or polite. Palm Beach Post columnist Frank Cerabino has chronicled Trump's tumultuous relationship with local officials since the wealthy businessman bought Marjorie Merriweather Post's historic Palm Beach estate more than 30 years ago. FRANK CERABINO: He started out as sort of an abrasive outsider who came in and was dismayed that things weren't up to snuff by his standards. For example, he bought a house that was in the flight path of the airport. So his solution was change the flight path or, better yet, just move the airport. ALLEN: Trump filed four different lawsuits related to the airport over the last 20 years. Litigation, the county says, has cost local taxpayers more than $600,000. Now that he's president-elect, the FAA is diverting flights away from Mar-a-Lago when Trump is there. Commissioner Steven Abrams says all's well that ends well. ABRAMS: As a prominent person in the community, there were both upsides and downsides. ALLEN: The community where Trump lives, Palm Beach, is an insular place - literally. It's a barrier island. Every visitor's vehicle is scrutinized by surveillance cameras on bridges from the mainland. From this spot just over the bridge, visitors get a good look at Trump's 17-acre estate, Mar-a-Lago. CERABINO: They really don't like anything that comes from over the bridge. ALLEN: Palm Beach Post columnist Frank Cerabino says now that he's president, Trump is likely to have an even greater impact on the community that's his part-time home. CERABINO: And if it means sightseers, if it means media, if it means people just stopping to take a picture or driving along A1A asking people where's Trump's house, that won't go over well. (CROSSTALK) ALLEN: In Palm Beach, the lunch counter at Green's Pharmacy is an institution, one that attracts locals like Lou Ann Swan. She's happy about Trump's win but concedes it will have an impact on the island. LOU ANN SWAN: Traffic - lots more people as tourists coming to see the Mar-a-Lago, White House of the South. ALLEN: It will be good for local businesses, Swan says, and worth the inconvenience. Bill Diamond is an old friend and supporter of Trump in Palm Beach but was still detoured over Thanksgiving when the Secret Service closed the island's main thoroughfare near Mar-a-Lago. BILL DIAMOND: The Secret Service stopped all traffic that wasn't going to Mar-a-Lago, and we went - just took the bridge and went to West Palm Beach and crossed at the next bridge that we could. So, you know, that's what you sort of have to expect. ALLEN: Some recall when another president, John F. Kennedy, vacationed in Palm Beach. Trump may disrupt traffic, but it's unlikely he'll be holding games of touch football on the beach. Greg Allen, NPR News, Miami.

npr,"December 22, 2016","Latinos Will Never Vote For A Republican, And Other Myths About Hispanics From 2016"," There were two major assumptions about Latino voters throughout the presidential campaign: (1) a record number of Latinos would show up on Election Day to oppose Donald Trump's candidacy and (2) the anti-immigration rhetoric that launched Trump's campaign would push conservative-leaning Hispanics to flee the Republican Party. Neither of those assumptions entirely panned out as expected. Prediction 1: The Surge?  True. A record number of Latinos did vote this November. But the truth is complicated. The official national exit poll, the one commissioned by the big media organizations, suggests the Latino share of the electorate was higher than ever before — about 11 percent, compared to 10 percent in 2012. ""It's very possible that the Latino vote, while reaching a record, may have been swamped by other groups of voters,"" said Mark Hugo Lopez, the director of Hispanic Research at the Pew Research Center, pointing to states like Florida which Trump won. We won't know the percentage of Latinos who participated in the 2016 election until Census data is released in the spring. But for some background, 48 percent of eligible Hispanic voters turned out in the 2012 election, down from 49.9 percent in 2008. Lopez says it's highly likely Latino turnout saw a small uptick this November, just based on sheer population growth. ""Although how much of a slight uptick remains to be seen,"" he said. ""It's unlikely the Hispanic voter turnout rate matched that of whites or matched that of blacks ... It doesn't seem like there was a Trump effect or a surge in Latino voter participation that many analysts were expecting."" For some comparison, in the last three presidential elections, both whites and blacks had voter turnout that was at or above 60 percent. Prediction 2: The Runaway Republican

 Latino voters go to the polls for early voting at the Miami-Dade Government Center on October 21, 2004 in Miami, Florida. A key constituency in Florida, many wondered how conservative Latinos would vote after now President-elect Trump's remarks on immigration. Unlike the surge, which is still awaiting Census data confirmation, prediction No. 2 has data — so we'll spend more time on it. Months ago on a reporting trip to Orlando, I met Anthony Suarez, a Republican lawyer from Florida. He's the president of the Puerto Rican Bar Association. He knows the local Puerto Rican community well, so he was anxious about Trump's candidacy and what it would mean for his fellow Latino Republicans. In fact, he had this bold, ominous prediction: ""I thought that the rhetoric coming out of Donald Trump was so toxic, that it would eventually turn off the Hispanic community as Barry Goldwater turned off the African-American community."" 
                Anthony Suarez was worried his fellow Republican Hispanics would flee the GOP this year because of Donald Trump. He voted for Hillary Clinton

 Anthony Suarez was worried his fellow Republican Hispanics would flee the GOP this year because of Donald Trump. He voted for Hillary Clinton Goldwater's opposition to civil rights in the 1960s is one reason black voters make up the base of the Democratic Party today. (Roughly 90 percent supported Clinton this past November). But, on election night, Suarez, who voted for Hillary Clinton, never witnessed that Goldwater moment. Instead, he found himself surrounded by people he described as ""Trump Hispanics"" at a party for a local Republican candidate. ""It certainly was more than I would have thought,"" Suarez said. ""I was surprised to see it."" Suarez miscalculated, but so did a lot of analysts. Maybe the big lesson from 2016 is that a solid number of Latinos are conservative, and they will consistently vote for Republicans. Roughly 30 percent of Hispanics chose a Republican candidate in each of the last three election cycles. According to the official exit poll, Trump performed roughly on par with Republican Mitt Romney, capturing 28 percent of the Latino vote, though that number is up for debate. Most notably, the polling firm Latino Decisions conducted an Election Eve poll that showed only 18 percent of Latinos chose Trump. (Two of the primary analysts with Latino Decisions — Matt Barreto and Gary Segura — did polling for the Clinton campaign though they were walled off from the firm's work during the campaign). Frankly, regardless of which statistic is correct — 28 percent or 18 — the truth is that a substantial number of Hispanics voted for Trump. And one major reason is religion. ""For most Latinos, not only Hispanic evangelicals, family values are important, social values are important,"" said Pastor Mario Bramnick, a Trump surrogate from South Florida. ""There was this real skew toward religious liberties in the last eight years of the Obama administration,"" Bramnick said. ""And, Mr. Trump said, 'You guys are losing your right to speak,' and he said, 'If I become president ... you will have your right to speak like everybody else.'"" Trump made a concerted effort to reach out to Latino conservative Christians, creating a Hispanic advisory council and meeting with ministers. Both of his sons visited Latino congregations on the final Sunday before the election. And, presumably, at least some of this outreach paid off. 
                Joseph Adorno voted for Trump but would have preferred a candidate like Marco Rubio or Ben Carson. For Adorno, a vote for Trump was essentially a vote for party loyalty and Christian values.

 Joseph Adorno voted for Trump but would have preferred a candidate like Marco Rubio or Ben Carson. For Adorno, a vote for Trump was essentially a vote for party loyalty and Christian values. ""So, I ended up voting for Donald Trump 'cause I thought he was closer to the values that I have,"" said 23-year-old Joseph Adorno with a sigh. And then he added, ""I mean, he's obviously not perfect."" Adorno would have much rather preferred a candidate like Marco Rubio or Ben Carson. For Adorno, a vote for Trump was essentially a vote for party loyalty and Christian values. ""I guess it's more about the Republican Party in a way,"" he said. ""You know, the person that was gonna be elected would nominate a lot of people in power, like the judges, and I felt [Trump] would nominate more conservative judges."" But, for other Latinos, like Orlando Diaz, 33, from Maryland, a vote for Trump wasn't about party loyalty; in fact, it was the polar opposite feeling — that Trump defied traditional party affiliation. ""In my eyes, I did see Trump as a different kind of Republican,"" said Diaz, who up until this election season was a registered Democrat. Diaz had voted for President Obama, but was no fan of Clinton as the Democratic nominee this year. ""What I saw in Hillary Clinton was just more of the same. And what I saw in Trump was change,"" Diaz said. ""When Bernie wasn't nominated that's pretty much when I knew I was gonna go over to Donald Trump."" Diaz said, in particular, he liked the way Trump spoke about the Department of Defense and veterans. He saw Trump as a man of strength, and he liked that. ""I have 12 years of service in the army,"" Diaz said. ""One of the things that President-elect Trump has mentioned is that he wants to increase the size of the Army, which I think is necessary during the situations that are going on right now in the world."" Immigration wasn't the threshold issue Democrats hoped it would be For Adorno, a vote for Trump was about values; for Diaz, a vote for Trump was about veterans and ""change."" There was an assumption that Trump's immigration rhetoric would have been a threshold issue. But it wasn't. Diaz, like other Trump-supporting Latinos, was well-aware of Trump's comments about Mexican immigrants and a border wall, but he didn't take them personally. ""Me, as a Puerto Rican, I did not really think he was addressing the entire Hispanic community,"" Diaz said. ""The term Hispanic identifies maybe around 18 or 19 countries that speak Spanish. I didn't feel that, me, as a Puerto Rican, that I was part of that group he was talking about."" Still, he wishes Trump would have worded some of his remarks differently, and he understands why some Latinos were bothered. ""I definitely understand how it could alienate people and how people could take it as offensive,"" he said. And, it wasn't only Diaz who thought this. Nearly every Trump-supporting Latino I interviewed told me some version of — well, clearly Trump wasn't talking about all Hispanics. ""It didn't trouble me at all because he was talking about people who had come across the U.S. illegally,"" said Julian Camacho, a Trump voter from California. Camacho's family has roots in Mexico, but they've lived in the United States for generations. Even for some new immigrants, like Flaminio Guerrero from Colombia, the immigration issue wasn't a deal-breaker. Guerrero now lives in Georgia, where he recently became a citizen. This November was the first presidential election in which he was eligible to vote. ""I understand Mexicans when they get offended,"" Guerrero said. ""But, at the same time, when I first came to America, every time someone asked me, 'Where are you from?' And, if I would say Colombia, immediately they would think of drugs."" Initially, Guerrero said that stereotype bothered him. ""I was ashamed,"" he said. ""But at the same time, I could not call these people racist, because they're just facing a reality."" Guerrero said the truth is — in the days when he first moved to the United States, Colombia was exporting a lot of drugs. ""Most of us, on the minority groups, get offended for things that in reality are actually true,"" he said. ""We have to learn to own our sins."" And, besides, for him, a vote for Trump wasn't really about immigration, it was about the economy. ""I liked the fact that he's not an insider; he comes from the outside; he comes from the business world,"" Guerrero said. ""He knows how to negotiate."" A Latino floor for Republicans Perhaps the lesson is that any generic GOP candidate will always get a guaranteed percentage of the Latino vote. ""It's possible that there is a floor among Latinos for Republicans, and that may be somewhere around 20 to 25 percent,"" said Mark Hugo Lopez with the Pew Research Center. But, he added, the candidate still matters. ""The right candidate can perhaps adjust that floor up or down."" Lopez thinks there's a bigger lesson. He points out that for years, pundits have said that a Republican candidate needs at least 40 percent of the Hispanic vote to win the White House. But... ""A Republican candidate won the White House without 40 percent or more of the Hispanic vote,"" he noted. ""Perhaps this election only goes to show you that the Hispanic vote, while growing in importance, is not the decider of national elections."" If you think about this another way, Clinton was on par with Obama levels of Hispanic support in 2008, capturing two-thirds of the Latino vote, but still lost the election. So, although the demographics of the country are changing, and every year, Latinos are becoming a larger share of the population, for now, it's possible to win less than a third of the Latino vote, and still win the presidency.

npr,"December 22, 2016",Trump's Businesses Could Be Tripped Up By A 2012 Insider Trading Law," President-elect Donald Trump insists he can do all the business deals he wants while serving in the White House, but a 2012 law barring insider trading by government officials could make doing so a lot more complicated. The Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge — STOCK — Act bars members of Congress and their staffs from buying and selling securities based on inside information. The U.S. Office of Government Ethics recently said the law also covers executive branch employees, including the president and vice president. Some government ethics experts argue that the law should also apply to Trump and his family's network of businesses. ""If he continues to own his businesses and he uses insider information, or information he has as president, then arguably it's a violation of the STOCK Act,"" says Larry Noble, general counsel of the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan advocacy group. Trump has repeatedly said that he plans to turn over management of his businesses to his grown children once he is in the White House and play no role in operations himself. Trump has often said he has no plans to do deals in the White House, though he also adds that no law prevents him from doing so. Under the Ethics in Government Act, most government employees are barred from participating in decision-making that affects them financially, but the law exempts presidents and vice presidents. ""You know, under the law I have the right to do it. I just don't want to do it. I don't want to do deals,"" he said in a Dec. 11 interview with Fox News Sunday. But there are no such exemptions under the STOCK Act. ""The STOCK Act says all executive branch employees are subject to the securities laws, Trump included,"" says New York University Law School professor Stephen Gillers. ""The purpose of the STOCK Act was to restore people's trust in our government, because I had learned, along with the rest of America, that apparently members of Congress were not banned from insider trading, like every other American citizen,"" said the bill's lead author, Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, in an interview with NPR: ""If you know anything about members of Congress and the executive branch, senior members, they have a lot of inside information. They have a lot of nonpublic information. For example, they know if a law is going to be renewed or enforced or broadened. They know if some kind of company is going to be highlighted for bad behavior. They know this in advance. So if they were able to buy or sell stock based on that nonpublic information, they could really make a lot of money."" The STOCK Act originally applied to the buying and selling of securities, such as stocks and bonds. But some legal experts say privately held companies such as the Trump Organization could also fall under its purview, especially if Trump transfers ownership to his children. Because presidents are privy to an enormous amount of information that could affect stock prices, Trump would risk passing on inside information anytime he talks to his children, even if he doesn't intend to. That could open Trump, his children and businesses up to nearly constant allegations of insider trading. ""I think it can create tremendous problems for a president that has a lot of financial and business interests that either he's actively involved with or knows about, or his family's actively involved with,"" says Noble of the Campaign Legal Center.

npr,"December 22, 2016",Renewable Energy Sector Remains Optimistic Amid Trump Policy Outlook," President-elect Donald Trump has appointed several Cabinet members with strong ties to oil and gas. And he's been clear about his support for coal. That could leave renewable energy companies out in the cold. But the picture isn't as dire for them as you might think. ""I know a lot about solar — I love solar,"" Trump said at a campaign rally in California last summer. ""Except there's a problem with it. It's got a lot of problems with it. One problem is it's so expensive."" That's probably enough to make most solar company executives break out in a sweat. But not Michael Wheeler at Recurrent Energy. ""We're feeling as though we're going to be OK,"" he says. Wheeler looks genuinely calm as he says this in his San Francisco office, which has big photos of the solar farms his company builds. And the reason why: he says Trump is wrong. ""Anybody who thinks that solar is expensive at the utility scale right now hasn't seen the latest,"" Wheeler says. ""Solar's price, because it's a technology, will continue to go lower and lower."" Power from big solar projects is about 70 percent cheaper today than it was a decade ago. Wind power has also come down. That has electric utilities choosing renewables on cost alone, even in red states like Texas and Georgia. ""Clean energy is not a niche product anymore,"" Wheeler says. Not to mention, the Trump administration might open public lands up for development. Environmentalists don't like that but it could make it easier for solar and wind companies to build projects. But there are few things that Wheeler and other renewable companies are worried about. For one, they rely on longstanding tax credits. They were extended in Congress last December. But Trump has complained about those subsidies. Wheeler says canceling them could hurt demand for solar and wind, but wouldn't kill it. The other big issue is Obama's climate change policy, known as the Clean Power Plan, which would require states to move away from coal power. Wheeler says that would have quadrupled the market for renewables, but Trump has vowed to toss it out. ""To have that be messaged as being dead was pretty heart-wrenching,"" Wheeler says. Still, the federal government isn't the only place policy gets made. Dan Kammen, an energy professor at UC Berkeley, says sometimes a hostile White House can energize regional efforts. ""I think there's no question states are going to be critical,"" he says. ""Just like under President George Bush, we saw tremendous action at the state level."" California is all in on renewables. State law requires 50 percent renewable energy by 2030. And 28 other states also have goals, most of which are likely to stick around even if the Clean Power Plan goes away. Kammen says that means the renewable energy market has momentum. It's only a question of how much. ""An administration can dramatically put its finger on the scale and accelerate that or they can hold it back,"" he says. In the meantime, demand for renewables is growing worldwide. Kammen was recently in Dubai, where solar farms are being planned at record-low costs — a sign to him that renewables are here to stay, no matter what the next administration does.

npr,"December 21, 2016",North Carolina Lawmakers Fail To Repeal Controversial Bathroom Law," North Carolina's governor called the legislature into special session today, the fifth this year. The purpose - to repeal House Bill 2, the law that limits protections for LGBT people. It's known as the bathroom bill. Lawmakers have yet to repeal the law. And to tell us where things stand now, we're joined by Jeff Tiberii, statehouse reporter with WUNC radio. And Jeff, what's happening right now at the state legislature there in Raleigh? JEFF TIBERII, BYLINE: At this moment, the Republicans are trying to work on a piece of legislation that would have enough votes. What has been before the Senate is Senate Bill 4, and this would indeed repeal House Bill 2. At the same time, it would also mandate a cooling-off period for any municipality in the state, and it would prevent cities and counties and towns from passing any kind of nondiscrimination ordinance such as the one Charlotte did back in February that, you know, was one of the reasons that this ordeal has come about here in North Carolina. Republican State Senator Phil Berger - he's perhaps the most powerful lawmaker in the state - said that this ultimately amounts to a reset. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PHIL BERGER: It gives everyone an opportunity to start over. You don't get those chances very often. And that six-month cooling-off period - that's six months for us to work through this. TIBERII: So that cooling off period, Ari, was initially going to be six months. Then after several long, closed-door meetings - at one point, Senate Republicans said they were going to have a 10-minute meeting, and it lasted two and a half hours. Well, they came back, and it was - it turned out to be an amendment. So the cooling-off period would now be extended a little bit further. But it's still not clear if the votes are there. SHAPIRO: The outgoing governor, McCrory, is a Republican. He called this session. Republicans control the legislature. Why isn't this process smoother? TIBERII: (Laughter) In short because North Carolina politics lacks smoothness these days. The North Carolina House is a pretty diverse caucus. In terms of Republicans, there are 75 of them there. And we're talking about representatives that serve very deeply red districts, others who serve in suburban areas, others who even have some urban areas within their districts. One of the chief complaints against the proposal thus far to repeal House Bill 2 is that it isn't actually, you know - it doesn't do what it says. And Chris Sgro, who's a Democratic representative, said just that. He said this would not be a true repeal. CHRIS SGRO: I think it's nothing more than HB2.2. It doubles down on discrimination by continuing to preempt municipal-level nondiscrimination protections. It does so for six months right now. What's to say that they don't extend that another six months and another six months going into the future? TIBERII: So Democrats are very skeptical of this at the moment. And as of right now, there are still not enough votes in the North Carolina House to advance a repeal and other stipulations of House Bill 2. SHAPIRO: Jeff, this has become known as the bathroom bill, but it's actually much broader than that. Remind people of what this does. TIBERII: It is. This deals with employment protections and raising the minimum wage at the local level. And beyond bathrooms, it would also - or it does prevent cities and municipalities from passing nondiscrimination ordinances of their own. It also - if you were to be terminated and you believe it's because you're a member of the LGBT community or fired because of race, it also reduces the window of time that you have to file a lawsuit. SHAPIRO: And this fits into a very messy political scene in North Carolina beyond just the repeal of this bill as well. Tell us how it fits into the larger picture. TIBERII: Right. You mentioned the Republican governor a couple moments ago. Pat McCrory was a champion of House Bill 2. He lost in November in part because of this. Democratic Governor-elect Roy Cooper is coming in. And much of this whole scene right now is really a distraction from what happened last week, and that was a special session where lawmakers came in and removed significant executive powers from the Democratic governor-elect, just the latest thing that brought about controversy down here in Raleigh. SHAPIRO: All right, that's Jeff Tiberii of WUNC. Thanks a lot. TIBERII: My pleasure, Ari. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

""This shocking report requires a full accounting of the number of known cases of advanced black lung disease,"" said Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., who joined Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Va., in asking federal agencies to respond.

 The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health sent a mobile testing unit to a fire station in Wharton, W.Va., in 2012 to screen coal miners for black lung disease. ""A worker who descends into the depth and darkness of our nation's coal mines should not have to suffer in silence,"" Casey added. ""We must work to identify those with black lung and ensure they get the care they need."" NPR surveyed black lung clinics across Appalachia. Eleven responded, reporting 962 cases of what is also known as ""complicated"" black lung so far this decade. In roughly the same time period, NIOSH reported just 99 cases nationwide. A letter signed by Scott and Casey asks NIOSH to lead a study of complicated black lung cases identified by its own national testing program, by black lung claims handled by the Labor Department's Coal Mine Workers' Compensation Program and by black lung clinics funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration. ""It is our larger goal to understand the full dimensions and potential burden of PMF ... diagnosed among current and former coal miners, particularly with regards to the impacts on the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund,"" the lawmakers' letter says. The letter cites the NPR investigation, which raised concerns that unreported and seemingly unrecognized cases of this most severe form of black lung could create unanticipated burdens on the federal program that pays black lung benefits. The program is nearly $6 billion in debt and faces ongoing funding challenges given shutdowns and bankruptcies of some of the mining companies that pay into the fund. ""A large number of PMF cases go undetected by NIOSH,"" the letter says. The lawmakers want each agency to count PMF cases and eliminate any duplication among the agencies ""to learn how the surveillance efforts ... can be improved and so that the full dimensions of black lung in all of its forms can be more readily identified."" HRSA doesn't require its federally funded black lung clinics to report cases of progressive massive fibrosis. Many of the clinics contacted by NPR were able to provide only partial or incomplete information. Some were unable to provide any data. That suggests the number of cases is much higher than the clinics reported. The lawmakers say they ""understand that NIOSH is willing to take the lead on aggregating and reporting the information"" and hope that the other agencies will find that ""agreeable."" A spokeswoman for NIOSH said the agency official involved is out of the office for the holidays and not available for comment. A spokesman for HRSA says the agency will respond to Casey and Scott directly. The CMWCP did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Black lung is caused by inhalation of coal mine dust. NIOSH and the clinics responding to NPR report advanced cases among much younger miners than historically reported and more rapid progression to severe stages of disease. PMF is incurable and fatal, and is believed to be caused by inhaled silica dust, which is generated when mining companies cut rock and coal together in thin coal seams embedded in quartz.

npr,"December 21, 2016",N.C. Lawmakers Consider Repeal Of Controversial 'Bathroom Law'," North Carolina's governor called the legislature into special session today, the fifth this year. The purpose was to repeal House Bill 2, the law that limits protections for LGBT people. It's known as the bathroom bill. Yet tonight, the North Carolina Senate adjourned without taking a vote. To tell us what this means and where the effort might go next, we're joined by Jeff Tiberii, state house reporter with member station WUNC. Hi, Jeff. JEFF TIBERII, BYLINE: Hello, Ari. SHAPIRO: We have been talking with you throughout the evening. Senators seemed close to passing something, then what happened? TIBERII: (Laughter) Well, they ended up not passing anything and not sending any legislation over to the House. Now, we may never know exactly why that was. Is this a joint effort because they didn't have the votes in the House and they wanted to kill it before it got there, or was it something else? (Laughter) There's a whole lot of conjecture, and certainly the blame game has started here in North Carolina. I don't expect that to end any time soon. After the session adjourned tonight, Republican lawmakers in the Senate were very quick to pivot, turn the focus and the blame back on the Charlotte City Council and also on Democratic Governor-elect Roy Cooper. Phil Berger, who is the leader of that chamber, really the most powerful politician in North Carolina, had this to say moments after the session ended and there was no repeal of House Bill 2. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PHIL BERGER: One side of this equation does not want to repeal House Bill 2. They want House Bill 2 as an issue just as it was an issue in the campaign. TIBERII: Now, to be clear, House Bill 2 has been a wedge issue. It has been a shiny object. And I don't say that insensitively, but it has been something that both sides have used to rile up their bases as it pertains to elections, and it is the case for now. No deal has been reached, and we're going to see this - more of this moving into 2017. SHAPIRO: But Jeff, help us understand. The outgoing governor is Republican. The legislature is overwhelmingly Republican. Why couldn't Republicans just get together and do this? TIBERII: That's a great question. And that's a question I posed to Berger and some of the most powerful members of the House Chamber as well. And they were very quick to adjust and say that, you know, there's a trust issue with the folks of Charlotte. Charlotte, earlier this week, listeners might remember, agreed to repeal the city council ordinance there. So they were first going to do a rescind of the local ordinance, and then a state repeal was going to follow. State lawmakers... SHAPIRO: This is the local ordinance that protected... TIBERII: Yeah. SHAPIRO: ...LGBT rights. TIBERII: Correct, that protected individuals who - transgender people. And what happened after the failure to repeal tonight was kind of a blame game, and they shined the light back on Charlotte. And they said that Charlotte was disingenuous in which the way it repealed. But to your point, this is a bit of a distraction - right? - because there are supermajorities in both chambers. And as we've seen over the last four years, if this general assembly wants to get something done, they get it done. And tonight, they did not do that. SHAPIRO: What are the larger implications of this? This bill, though - it's known as the bathroom bill - is actually far more sweeping than that. TIBERII: It is. It's absolutely far more sweeping, and it's truly a black eye for the state in many ways. After the session tonight, I spoke with Pricey Harrison, who's a Democrat from Guilford County, and she said that this was just overall a pretty lousy day for her and her colleagues. PRICEY HARRISON: I don't like to assign blame necessarily. I just think it was a really unfortunate day for North Carolina that we could not remove this stain from our state. It's just a - I was telling somebody I feel like I've been a funeral. And we had a chance to take our state back, and we lost it. TIBERII: So Democratic Governor-elect Roy Cooper is coming in, and this is going to continue to be an issue between Democrats and Republicans, the executive branch and the legislature. And this comes just a week after Republicans held a different special session to strip that Democratic governor-elect of some of his power - so really wild political times down here. SHAPIRO: Jeff Tiberii of member station WUNC speaking with us from the state legislature in Raleigh, N.C. Thank you, Jeff. TIBERII: Ari, my pleasure. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Barbara Boxer Considers Path Forward For Democrats"," BARBARA BOXER: Dianne was the more popular, the more well-known, the more moderate and all that, and everybody said to me, oh, we like you but we can't vote for more than one woman and... KELLY MCEVERS, BYLINE: At a time? BOXER: Yeah. I mean they thought that was a big deal. Remember, we never had a woman from California and only one woman Democrat had been elected in her own right, Barbara Mikulski. MCEVERS: And then so you were elected to the Senate in 1992, and people then came to call it the year of the woman. BOXER: Yeah. MCEVERS: Four women were voted into the Senate that year, and at the time, your colleague, Barbara Mikulski, senator of Maryland, said calling it the year of the woman makes it sound like the year of the caribou or the year of the asparagus - we're not a fad, a fancy or a year. BOXER: Yeah. MCEVERS: What do you think about... BOXER: Well, Barbara has a way, doesn't she? MCEVERS: (Laughter). BOXER: But I always thought it was an exaggeration. After all, we went from two to six in the Senate, and they said, well, they tripled their numbers. Well, that's great, but just two to six out of a hundred? So it was an overstatement, but it did signal, for the first time, perhaps women could get elected to these high offices, and now we have - we're going to have 21 women. That's a high. And, in my view, when we have 50 that will be exactly fine. MCEVERS: But - with 21 in the Senate, that is a high, but if you look at Congress, it's actually gone down a little bit. I mean the overall, you know, result of women in Congress since the last election has kind of flatlined. BOXER: Well, I don't look at it that way. I think we made history this year. We had the first woman ever nominated to be the presidential candidate of a major party. The woman, Hillary Clinton, got far more votes than the man. Because of the Electoral College, he'll be coming. He'll be president. I can hardly say it, but that's OK. And, you know, it's an unfair system, but, I just don't view it as, you know, an attack on women, the fact that there's a few less of us in the House. But there's more of us in the Senate, and there's going to be more and more of us because I think people are recognizing - men and women - that it's just wrong not to have a representative government. MCEVERS: How hard was it for you to see Hillary Clinton lose the presidential election? BOXER: Oh, it was painful, hurtful. I even got, like, a physical reaction to it. I could barely pick myself up off the floor. You know, really, really bad. MCEVERS: I mean you fought for women's rights in the Senate. What do you think women should do now? BOXER: Oh, fight for what's right. MCEVERS: Specifically, how? BOXER: Well, it's very easy. You introduce legislation that moves us forward. You fight bad legislation. You work with outside groups who may find ways to sue if we're treated badly and lose our rights. It's every front. MCEVERS: This is a time of crisis, though, for the Democratic Party. I mean there's lots of talk about whether the party should do more to reach out to white working-class voters, voters who... BOXER: Yeah, I don't think we're in crisis at all. This is my view. I think what we need to do is marry the Bernie wing of the party with the Hillary wing, the standing together and stronger together wing with the populist wing, and we'll be fine. MCEVERS: How does that work? I mean first of all, who's the person who could do that? BOXER: Barack Obama. Joe Biden. Michelle Obama. I think Barack Obama on the national stage - and he's going to be very important because he has a legacy to protect. MCEVERS: OK. But, yeah, he's somebody who's leaving the presidency. BOXER: You don't have to be the president. MCEVERS: The first lady is leaving the presidency, the vice president is leaving. You're leaving. Everybody's leaving office. I mean that looks - sounds like it's looking back. BOXER: No. Here's the thing I don't think you get. You are almost a better leader when you're outside of the confines of holding public office. You're - I'm going to be uncensored. I'm going to be unfiltered. MCEVERS: When you say you're going to be uncensored, what are you going to say that you couldn't say before? BOXER: Well, stay tuned. I'm still a senator. I can't do it. I can't - I can't... MCEVERS: (Laughter). Got a couple more days, yeah, before we can hear what you have to say. BOXER: I have a couple of weeks, I think, and then I'm going to be able to be me. But what we have to do is face the fact that we lost, be honest about mistakes that were made and just get up and move forward. MCEVERS: You said we have to be honest about the mistakes that were made in this election. What were those mistakes? BOXER: Well, when I - you know, this is all hindsight. I think rather than sending Hillary to Arizona and Texas, it would've been better to send her into those states where we lost by a hair - you know, Michigan... MCEVERS: Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania. BOXER: Yeah, yeah. I mean we didn't do that, and so that was a mistake. I also would like to say I think when people would say, oh, I just can't vote for Hillary 'cause I don't like this and that email or this, I would say, look, nobody is perfect. I always tell people, you're never going to find the perfect candidate unless you yourself run. But it's very difficult for people. They want perfection. I feel we're going to pay the price for that. MCEVERS: Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat from California, who is retiring after more than three decades in Congress, thank you very much. BOXER: It's been a pleasure to talk to you.

HB 154, aims to make roads safer for cyclists by setting a 3-foot-minimum safe passing distance when a motor vehicle overtakes a bicycle on the road. But the wage and gun laws are attracting the most interest. Here are more details: The ban on local minimum wage laws is a setback to proponents of a $15-an-hour minimum pay rate, reports the Ideastream member station. ""Clevelanders were set to vote next May on a proposal to phase in that wage increase over the next few years. Many city leaders, including council president Kevin Kelley, opposed raising the wage in the city alone."" The station adds, ""Ohio's minimum wage is $8.10 an hour for non-tipped employees. It's set to increase by five cents next year."" The gun legislation also applies to public areas of airports (but not beyond security screening stations), in addition to colleges and day cares. The Cleveland Plain Dealer provides these details about how guns might be carried on campuses: ""College boards of trustees would have to vote to allow concealed firearms; child care centers and in-home daycare would have to post a sign if firearms aren't allowed. ""The law also allows active-duty military to carry concealed guns without a permit and prohibits employers from banning permit holders from bringing guns into company parking lots. It takes effect in 90 days."" Two other notable bills were left in limbo, WOSU says: ""Kasich has not taken action on the measure extending the freeze on the state's renewable energy requirements for electric utilities till 2020. And he also didn't sign the legislation that would require state lawmakers to review cabinet-level agencies periodically or they could disappear.""

npr,"December 21, 2016","More Than A Month Since Election Day, Trump, Clinton Teams Can't Let It Go"," To glance at some of the political news this week, you'd think it was October. Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta did Meet the Press over the weekend to talk about Russia hacking the DNC's emails. Hillary Clinton aide Brian Fallon took to Twitter on Tuesday to question the FBI's investigation into Clinton's emails. Donald Trump and Bill Clinton sniped at each other. But it's mid-December. The voters and electors alike have cast their votes. And while millions of Americans are doubtless more than happy to have Election Day well behind them, they can still plan on hearing still more about the election in the coming days or even weeks. There's good reason for some of the continuing concern over the election. The FBI and CIA alike say they are now confident Russia hacked the DNC's emails, that Putin was involved, and it was all in an attempt to influence the election in Trump's favor. That could have very real repercussions. President Obama told NPR's Steve Inskeep that Russia's interference would spark U.S. retaliation. Bill Clinton stated that I called him after the election. Wrong, he called me (with a very nice congratulations). He ""doesn't know much"" ... especially how to get people, even with an unlimited budget, out to vote in the vital swing states ( and more). They focused on wrong states However, there will never be any way of knowing how much influence those hacked emails may have had on the election. (As Slate's Theodore Johnson put it, ""Russia didn't hack the U.S. election. It hacked the voters."") Likewise, on Tuesday, Fallon took to Twitter to once again address the issue of Clinton's emails and the FBI's investigation: ""[FBI Director James] Comey's intrusion on the election was as utterly unjustified,"" referring to Comey's late-October announcement that the agency would be looking into thousands of emails that had just come to light. Meanwhile, some of the election relitigation has been in the form of petty taunts. Former President Bill Clinton this week said of Trump: ""He doesn't know much. One thing he does know is how to get angry white men to vote for him."" That clearly irked Trump. The president-elect flung the insult back, tweeting that Clinton ""doesn't know much."" In a subsequent tweet, Trump added that Clinton doesn't know ""how to get people, even with an unlimited budget, out to vote in the vital swing states (and more). They focused on wrong states."" Campaigning to win the Electoral College is much more difficult &amp; sophisticated than the popular vote. Hillary focused on the wrong states! I would have done even better in the election, if that is possible, if the winner was based on popular vote - but would campaign differently I have not heard any of the pundits or commentators discussing the fact that I spent FAR LESS MONEY on the win than Hillary on the loss! While Bill Clinton prompted these particular Trump tweets, they are an extension of something Trump has done before, pumping up his political prowess and taunting Hillary Clinton, who has maintained a low profile since Election Day. On Wednesday morning, Trump bragged about winning the election despite raising far less money than Clinton, and he again slammed her for having ""focused on the wrong states."" Trump has repeatedly responded to the fact that despite winning the electoral vote comfortably, he lost the popular vote to Clinton by 2.8 million votes. At one point, he made the baseless claim that millions of fraudulent votes helped Clinton to that margin. Some of the lingering concerns about Election Day (for example, about a foreign power meddling in U.S. elections) are real. But it also means a deluge of Monday-morning quarterbacking after a long, nasty campaign. For their part, some Democrats are pushing the party to look forward instead of backward. The field of candidates for the chairmanship of the Democratic National Committee is growing. In addition, former Clinton campaign spokesman Jesse Ferguson wrote a strident op-ed at Time this week urging Democrats to move on. ""The time for mourning is over, Democrats. We've had over a month,"" he wrote, adding later that the party needs both introspection but also to consider the scope of its loss: ""Just because you epically lost an expectations game doesn't mean you epically lost an election."" Meanwhile, Trump will have a country to run. He has been going through the requisite transition steps, even kicking off his Cabinet appointments more quickly than many other presidents, as the Washington Post's Philip Bump pointed out. But then, even amid the roar of news from around the world in the past couple of weeks — an assassination in Turkey, a refugee crisis in Syria, an attack on a market in Germany — Trump's Twitter feed suggests that his Electoral College win and popular-vote loss remain in the front of his mind (the juxtaposition still kind of annoying him). In a way, all of the backward-looking may be fitting for a candidate whose campaign was all about nostalgia (making America great again). But in one month, he will have a whole four years ahead of him (and maybe eight), not to mention some very big decisions to concern himself with.

npr,"December 21, 2016",Repeal Of North Carolina's HB2 Law Fails As Legislature Adjourns Special Session," Updated at 8:00 p.m. ET The North Carolina Legislature began a special session on Wednesday morning to vote on the repeal of a controversial state law that limits civil rights protections for LGBT people, but the effort failed by day's end as the Legislature adjourned without passing any bill. The session was part of a deal between state lawmakers and Charlotte officials. But some Republican state leaders are furious about the way they say Charlotte handled its side of the agreement. Charlotte officials, meanwhile, are denying allegations that they misrepresented their actions. The state law in question is HB2 — also called the ""bathroom bill"" because, among other things, it requires transgender people to use bathrooms that match the sex on their birth certificate. It was passed in March, in direct response to an expansion of a local anti-discrimination measure in Charlotte the previous month. Republican state lawmakers and Democratic leaders in Charlotte had apparently struck a deal under which the city would repeal the local ordinance, and in return, state lawmakers would repeal HB2. Charlotte said it has carried out its side of the deal — but there are disputes about how the process worked, with Charlotte officials saying the City Council acted in good faith, and Republicans accusing them of lying. Here's what happened: On Monday, the Charlotte City Council announced it had ""voted to remove the Non-Discrimination Ordinance from the City Code."" People on both sides indicated an understanding had been reached — with Republican Gov. Pat McCrory calling Charlotte's repeal ""all about politics"" but agreeing to call a special session ""as promised."" Democratic Gov.-elect Roy Cooper called on legislators to ""keep their word"" and repeal HB2. But according to The Charlotte Observer, the City Council didn't actually repeal the full ordinance on Monday: ""Council members did remove the part of its ordinance that dealt with public accommodations, prohibiting business such as stores and restaurants from discriminating against people based on categories such as race and religion — and also sexual orientation and gender identity. That part of the ordinance included the provision that related to transgender people being allowed to use the bathroom that matches their gender identity. ""However, council members left some parts of the ordinance intact. ""The city's ordinance still prohibits the city from hiring contractors who have been found to discriminate against a subcontractor because of an employee's race or religion — as well as because of sexual orientation or gender identity. ""That means the city ordinance still offers some legal protections, though small ones, to people who are gay or transgender."" Around 1 a.m. ET on Wednesday, the executive director of the North Carolina Republican Party released a statement blasting Democrats in Charlotte, saying they ""lied directly to the people."" The City Council and Cooper ""have now seriously harmed HB2 repeal efforts,"" the statement reads. ""The HB2 blood is now stain soaked on their hands and theirs alone. What a dishonest, disgraceful shame by Roy Cooper and Charlotte Democrats."" Charlotte City Attorney Bob Hagemann says those allegations are false, reports David Boraks of member station WFAE. Boraks adds that Hagemann says the city did fully repeal the changes made to its anti-discrimination laws — with a vote that took the city ""back to 1968,"" the first year Charlotte had any sort of anti-discrimination measure. But to assuage concerns about how wholeheartedly Charlotte acted to reverse the measure, the City Council is now re-repealing the anti-discrimination protection, with a new vote to put the city back exactly where it was before the expansion passed in February. The Charlotte City Council scheduled an emergency session Wednesday morning and did just that, WFAE reports. All eyes turned to the state Legislature, where lawmakers debated a bill proposed by Senate Republicans that would repeal HB2 and institute a ""six-month cooling-off period"" during which no local government could pass a new ordinance protecting people from employment discrimination or regulating access to ""restrooms, showers, or changing facilities."" But a repeal measure ultimately failed in the Senate, and the special session of the Legislature adjourned without passing any bill.

npr,"December 21, 2016","Organizers Hope Women's March On Washington Inspires, Evolves"," The day after President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration, Jan. 20, 2017, a march is slated to take place on the National Mall. It's being called the Women's March on Washington. (It was being referred to, somewhat controversially, as the ""Million Women March"" before it was re-branded.) At this point, thousands of women and allies plan to rally here for the Women's March on Washington. The march aims to ""send a bold message to our new administration on their first day in office, and to the world that women's rights are human rights,"" according to the event's official website. ""We want to ensure that this country knows women are not happy,"" co-founder Tamika Mallory said. ""And when we get angry, change happens. We make things happen."" Catalyzed by a polarizing presidential race, the march aims to be a message to the new administration that there's a coalition planning to press the issue of women's rights in potentially high-profile ways over the next four years. ""This effort is not anti-Trump,"" Mallory said. ""This is pro-women. This is a continuation of a struggle women have been dealing with for a very long time. In this moment, we are connecting and being as loud as possible."" Trump created firestorms when it came to women's issues during the campaign. Upset with Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly bringing up in a debate his past crude remarks about women (calling some ""pigs,"" for example), he responded that she had ""blood coming out of her — wherever."" Trump was also caught on tape bragging about grabbing women by the genitals. ""[W]hen you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything,"" Trump said in the leaked 2005 video. Trump has a long history of making sexist or offensive remarks, and his candidacy happened to take place while running against a candidate who would have been the first female president. What started as a cross-country collaboration among seven women in the aftermath of Election Day gained traction online and is now a network of 50-plus events in multiple countries. Historical significance is embedded in the event's name: To march in Washington evokes the legacies of powerful public demonstrations in American history, such as Martin Luther King Jr.'s March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, the Moratorium March to End the War in Vietnam, the Million Man March to highlight the collective power of the African-American community, and the 2004 March for Women's Lives as a demonstration for reproductive and women's rights. Organizers are hoping to create a social movement, but Marcia Chatelain, a faculty fellow at Georgetown University's Center for Social Justice, said doing that depends on whether the Women's March's momentum can be sustained long after the march itself. ""One of the goals of any type of march or any type of visible sign of solidarity is to get inspired, to inspire people to do more,"" Chatelain said. ""And the question is, at the march, what kind of organizational structures or movements will also be present to help people know how to channel their energy for the next day and for the long haul?"" Organizers and activists can use the march to proffer alternative ways to create change in their communities and contribute to a greater movement from a local, everyday standpoint. ""Movements are not just the dramatic moments,"" Chatelain said. ""It's about the everyday acts of resistance that the marches are also trying to represent. Everyone has the capacity in their communities to resist."" A single event, while important to rally on a grass-roots level, is often politically ineffective in its immediate aftermath — it can take years to figure out how a demonstration like the Women's March will inform public policy, if at all. Georgetown history professor Michael Kazin noted that when it comes to effectively altering legislation, public demonstrations alone have a ""checkered history of success."" To affect policy, Kazin said, a march needs to be part of a greater social movement with clear and consistent objectives, constant pressure on the Legislature, dedicated support from its base and continued momentum. Perhaps most importantly, creating systemic change has historically called for one last critical element: help from people in government. ""All successful movements in American history have both inside and outside strategy,"" Kazin said. ""If you're just protesting, and it just stops there, you're not going to get anything done.""

npr,"December 21, 2016",N.C. Lawmakers To Consider Repealing Controversial Bathroom Law," DAVID GREENE, HOST:  This morning, the North Carolina state legislature will meet to vote on whether to repeal the controversial House Bill 2. This law infuriated advocates for gay, lesbian, bisexual and trans individuals. It limited legal protections for them. Today's vote is supposed to resolve a dispute between Republican lawmakers and a Democratic-controlled city council in Charlotte. David Boraks from member station WFAE reports. DAVID BORAKS, BYLINE: The tug of war started back in February. That's when Charlotte City Council voted to add sexual orientation to the city's anti-discrimination ordinance. A month later... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED NC REPRESENTATIVE: The House will come to order. BORAKS: ...North Carolina's Republican-controlled General Assembly passed House Bill 2 to override Charlotte's ordinance. Soon, businesses and organizations unhappy with HB2 started canceling hiring plans and big events like the NBA All-Star Game. Lawmakers then offered to repeal HB2 if Charlotte repealed its ordinance first. The council refused twice. This week, they had a change of heart, says council member Vi Lyles. VI LYLES: When we adopted our nondiscrimination ordinance, the intent was to make us a more welcoming city for economic development. When the state passed HB2, the unintended consequences were that we are not welcoming and we were losing jobs. So we have a big stake in making a change and having HB2 repealed. AL AUSTIN: I'm a member of the LGBT community and so this was tough. BORAKS: That's city council member Al Austin. He says the council's repeal wasn't the path he would have chosen, but it was a necessary step to end HB2. After Monday's surprise vote, many of the LGBT community felt betrayed. Matt Hirschy is with Equality NC. MATT HIRSCHY: I have to be very clear here, I can not endorse or support Charlotte rescinding any protection for LGBT folks, regardless of the ordinance being superseded by state law. BORAKS: Much of the discussion about HB2 focused on the law's requirement that transgender people use the bathroom of the sex on their birth certificates instead of their gender identities. That earned it a nickname - the bathroom bill. State and federal laws specifically protect people from discrimination based on race, national origin or age. In North Carolina, as in many states, it is legal to discriminate based on sexual orientation. Lara Americo is a 32-year-old transgender woman from Charlotte. She says she doesn't want to be a second-class citizen and she wants to feel safe. LARA AMERICO: It can be scary just walking out of the house as a transgender person, just knowing that someone can figure out that you're transgender and hate that about you. It's very hurtful. And the protections are needed. SEAN HERRMANN: What Charlotte did when it passed that ordinance was it expanded rights into an area where there just was nothing before. And that, you know, it lasted a very short time. BORAKS: Sean Herrmann is a Charlotte civil rights lawyer. Depending on what happens in today's special session, HB2 might not last long, either. If that happens... HERRMANN: The truth is it's just back to the norm. BORAKS: And the norm, Herrmann says, is that the LGBT community in the state is not protected from discrimination.

npr,"December 21, 2016",Cokie Roberts Answers Listeners' Questions About How Government Works," COKIE ROBERTS, BYLINE: Hi, David - try to answer them, anyway. GREENE: Try to answer them. ROBERTS: (Laughter). GREENE: Well, I love this one that we're going to talk about because, we should say, both of your parents were members of Congress. And Kathryn Bullinton - she wrote this question. What weight do politicians give to phone calls and letters? What's the most effective way to influence our congresspeople? What do you think? ROBERTS: You know, that's actually a terrific question. And the answer is that they give tremendous weight to letters and phone calls from people in their districts. If you send blast emails from some sort of organization or postcards or, worst of all, phone calls, they are not only not likely to pay attention. But they're likely to get annoyed. GREENE: Ticked off. ROBERTS: Right. If you go into a congressional office, and there's some phone-bank thing going on, you'll see some poor, harassed child sitting at the desk... (LAUGHTER) GREENE: Dealing with all the phone calls. ROBERTS: ...Dealing with all the phone calls. GREENE: Welcome to my office. This is your first job. ROBERTS: Right. Right. But if it's somebody who is from the district and, particularly, if it's someone who's active in the community in the district, members of Congress pay a tremendous amount of attention to those people. And the truth is if people from a member's district go to their offices and see that member, it really can make a difference. GREENE: Hmm. But, Cokie, let me ask you about the reality. I mean... ROBERTS: Yeah. GREENE: ...Almost every single House member seeking re-election wins. ROBERTS: Right. GREENE: So why spend the time worrying about an individual voter if their seats are so safe? Don't they have a lot of other things they could be doing? ROBERTS: You're right, though. About 96 percent of them get re-elected. But look. Part of the reason they get re-elected is because they pay attention to their voters. I always joke, you know, that they're like the old uncle you can't get rid of. GREENE: (Laughter). ROBERTS: They're at every high-school graduation, firehouse opening, bar mitzvah, first communion. GREENE: (Laughter). ROBERTS: But they're there to be in touch with voters. And the truth is that when you do that, you learn a lot. And you then bring that back to the halls of Congress. If you listen to your voters, it makes a big difference. And you saw that this year in the presidential campaign, where, suddenly, the whole question of opioid addiction was high on the candidates' list, which - it hadn't been before the campaign. But once they started listening to voters, particularly early on in New Hampshire... GREENE: Yeah. ROBERTS: They started hearing that. And so I think that members of Congress are very well aware of that. GREENE: Does this extend to the White House? I mean, I know President Obama, you know, famously asks his staff to give him 10 letters a night from, you know, the throngs of letters he gets. What is the point of that? ROBERTS: He apparently gets something like 100,000 emails a day... GREENE: Amazing. ROBERTS: And thousands of faxes and phone calls, as well as the letters. I think that, again, it's a learning exercise for the president. He's talked about getting at least a tiny bit out of the bubble that surrounds the presidency. He uses those letters in speeches to invoke real-world situations of voters and citizens. And some of them are lucky enough to get handwritten replies from the president of the United States. And, of course, that's a very valuable thing for those of us who write history books because that's how we write history books - is from presidential letters and letters of the people around the president. So it's nice to have at least a few of them now. GREENE: What about history? What about before emails, before the digital age? What was the communication with the White House? ROBERTS: It was letters, of course. But, also, people showed up at the White House. And I have to... GREENE: Actually walked in? ROBERTS: Walked in - and it makes me so jealous, David. They were just - they'd just sort of barge on in. And Sojourner Truth had a very famous meeting with President Lincoln. And that was by appointment. But she talked about going in. And she says - I'm quoting her here - ""we found about a dozen persons waiting to see him. Amongst them were two colored women - some white women also. And he showed as much respect and kindness to the colored persons present as to the whites."" So you learn - we learn - something from that. But I have to tell you I love the way these women would just sort of go in and tell off the president all the time. GREENE: (Laughter). ROBERTS: And a famous story is during Andrew Johnson's administration, when Adele Cutts-Douglas, the widow of Stephen Douglas, tried to keep him from executing Mary Surratt in the assassination of Lincoln. She failed. But she pushed aside bayonets to go in and harangue the president. GREENE: My goodness - what an earlier time. ROBERTS: (Laughter). GREENE: The Secret Service might not be so keen on them these days. ROBERTS: Right. GREENE: Commentator and columnist Cokie Roberts - always great to talk to you, Cokie. Copyright © 2016 NPR.

npr,"December 21, 2016","Gingrich Says Trump Must Address Business Conflicts Soon, Urges Monitoring"," Donald Trump should deal with how to handle his business holdings before he takes office, says former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, an adviser to the president-elect. But Gingrich says it would be ""an absurdity"" to put Trump's holdings in a blind trust. ""He has to understand and his family has to understand that there is a public interest which transcends them,"" Gingrich tells NPR's Rachel Martin. ""At the same time, we have to understand that this is a new situation we've never seen before, and the rules [that] were written for people who were dramatically less successful literally do not work."" Gingrich suggests that a panel of respected experts with ""total access"" regularly monitor Trump's businesses and tell the president: ""Don't go over these bounds. This has to be fixed; that can't be done that way.""  On what Trump needs to do in his first 100 days to satisfy those who voted for him Well, I think he needs to set a direction that allows people who are deeply opposed to Obamacare to realize it's gradually going to be reformed and rethought. ... I suspect that the opening 48 or 72 hours will have so many executive orders repealing Obama's executive orders that the average conservative will be giddy with excitement. On Trump's message in naming so-called disrupters to his Cabinet, like Rick Perry as energy secretary and Scott Pruitt to head the Environmental Protection Agency He was elected by people who believe Washington has too much power, the Washington bureaucracy is too arrogant and imperial. This was an election that had consequence. It probably rivals the Reagan election of '80 and the FDR election of '32, in that sense. Obama, by the way, had a similar election but couldn't sustain it, partly because he kept lying. And this will be a real test for Trump. If Trump remains honest and seems like a person who's authentic, he's going to go a long way. If, under the pressure of the city, he starts dissembling and saying things that aren't true, he'll decay much as Obama did. On whether Trump needs to be more transparent about his financial holdings I think they're going to have to find some system that convinces most reasonable people that they're operating within bounds of integrity and bounds that prevent corruption and prevent misuse of power. ... I've been suggesting that you find people, like [former] Attorney General [Michael] Mukasey, who are widely respected, and have a panel of, like, five of them who have total access to everything and who are able to say on a regular basis, maybe monthly, you know, don't go over these bounds, this has to be fixed, that can't be done that way. On Trump essentially saying ""trust me"" about how he'll deal with conflicts of interest That will not last. This is not a country that wanders around trusting people with power. This is a country that wants accountability. ... Now, again, he is unique and I totally defend him against those who, for example, want him to put his holdings in a blind trust, which is an absurdity. ... A large part of his holdings are Trump golf clubs, Trump hotels. I mean, we have never quite had anyone of this scale to occupy the White House, and it's going to require us to think about how do you deal with this in a way that's effective and that serves the interest of the country, but also meets some kind of practical common sense test. On Gingrich's suggestion that Trump could use the power of the pardon if anyone in his administration seemed to be violating conflict-of-interest laws or protocols The Constitution gives the president of the United States an extraordinarily wide grant of authority to use the power of the pardon. I'm not saying he should. I'm not saying he will. It also allows a president in a national security moment to say to somebody, ""Go do X,"" even if it's technically against the law, and, ""Here's your pardon because I am ordering you as commander in chief to go do this."" On Trump's often-stated promise to ""drain the swamp"" in Washington I'm told he now just disclaims that. He now says it was cute, but he doesn't want to use it anymore. ... I'd written what I thought was a very cute tweet about ""the alligators are complaining,"" and somebody wrote back and said they were tired of hearing this stuff. ... I've noticed on a couple of fronts, like people chanting ""lock her up,"" that he's in a different role now and maybe he feels that as president, as the next president of the United States, that he should be marginally more dignified than talking about alligators in swamps. I personally have, as a sense of humor, like the alligator and swamp language. ... I think it vividly illustrates the problem, because all the people in this city who are the alligators are going to hate the swamp being drained. And there's going to be constant fighting over it. But, you know, he is my leader and if he decides to drop the swamp and the alligator, I will drop the swamp and the alligator.

npr,"December 20, 2016",Proposed Fundraiser Featuring Trump's Sons Raises Questions," If you have a lot of money to spare, and want to spend time with the Trump family right after the inauguration, earlier Tuesday it seemed you might have been able to make that dream come true. A new nonprofit organization, the Opening Day Foundation, had advertised access to the Trumps at a big charity event to be held Jan. 21. The online invitation raised questions about exchanging huge charitable donations for face time with Trump's oldest sons. Now, the site just says ""Coming Soon."" The night-after party is called Opening Day. It has a shooting, fishing and conservation theme. The president's sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, were prominently mentioned in the invitation online. They're listed as directors on the nonprofit's official filing with the Texas secretary of state. 
                The Opening Day 45 website advertised an event honoring Donald Trump and listed his sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, as honorary co-chairmen. The site was later changed to say ""Coming Soon.""

 The Opening Day 45 website advertised an event honoring Donald Trump and listed his sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, as honorary co-chairmen. The site was later changed to say ""Coming Soon."" An early version of the invitation said Donald Trump himself would be at a reception for the $1 million and $500,000 donors. But late Tuesday afternoon, the Trump transition team described the event and details as ""initial concepts"" that haven't been approved or pursued by the Trump family. ""Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump are avid outdoorsmen and supporters of conservation efforts, which align with the goals of this event, however they are not involved in any capacity,"" spokeswoman Hope Hicks said. Broadly speaking, such a fundraiser would resemble what goes on in Washington every day. But in other ways, it would be a shocker. For starters, there's the price tag. Political money and ethics lawyer Ken Gross says politicians are always doing receptions — sometimes for politics, sometimes for charity. It's one thing if donors ante up $5,000 or $10,000. ""But when they're giving very huge sums to a charitable foundation, then it can be not just a matter of quantity,"" Gross says. ""It can change the kind of relationship with the individual."" The post-inaugural event was first reported by the Center for Public Integrity and the website TMZ. It came days after the news that Ivanka Trump was offering a 45-minute coffee date as an auction item for her brother Eric's private foundation before it was cancelled amid criticism. The propriety of these charity fundraisers was question No. 1 Tuesday when the Trump transition team briefed reporters. Did the president-elect have a policy, or will he make one, on his children's offers of access for contributions? ""I've not spoken yet with the president-elect on that particular issue,"" said Jason Miller, the transition team's spokesman. ""I'm happy to ask him and try to get back to you with an answer."" And why did the organizers even float the idea of having Trump family members headline a charity event — especially one where the specific charities had not even been designated? Frances Hill, a tax law professor at the University of Miami, says that if donors wanted to give big money to charities they could do it directly. ""There's no reason to make it a three-party transaction,"" Hill says. ""It's the dynamic of currying favor and access with the powerful, and nobody cares as much about the money as about the access."" She points out that the contributions going to access events are tax-deductible. NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor ",http://www.npr.org/506337200
npr,"December 20, 2016",Obama Administration Issues Offshore Drilling Ban In Arctic And Atlantic," President Obama made a last-minute move today to protect some of his environmental legacy. He ordered a permanent ban on oil drilling in large parts of the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans. The Obama administration says this decision cannot be reversed by future presidents. NPR's Jeff Brady joins us now. And Jeff, what exactly is President Obama telling his administration to do here? JEFF BRADY, BYLINE: This this order that the president has signed - it puts two very large areas off limits to drilling for oil and gas. One of those areas is in the Atlantic Ocean. It's nearly 6,000 square miles. It stretches from New England, offshore of Massachusetts all the way down to the Chesapeake Bay off the coast of Virginia. And the second area is up in the Arctic off the northern coast of Alaska. It's the entire Chukchi Sea and much of the Beaufort Sea except for this little strip along the northern coast of Alaska where there's already a lot of oil and gas activity. And President Obama's administration listed some specific reasons for making these places off-limit to oil and gas drilling, climate change being a big one, protecting sensitive habitats for endangered species such as polar bears and whales. And another justification is preserving these areas for native populations in Alaska who depend on these waters for food. And there's also concern about oil spills in the Arctic because this is a pretty harsh environment, and oil spills are much more likely there. And they're harder to clean up. SHAPIRO: People who support offshore oil drilling often say it'll create jobs and help the economy. Did the White House address those arguments? BRADY: Yeah, the White House says that the Arctic especially - there's less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the country's production that comes from that area now - so not much activity going on there. With low oil prices, it's very expensive to drill there. And overall, the administration says the country is producing a lot of oil now, and the president believes that this strikes a good balance between protecting sensitive areas and still leaving enough other places to drill to provide for the country's energy needs. And you know, the industry has had this line that says, if the U.S. bars offshore drilling in the Arctic and North Atlantic, you know, Canada will just come in and do it instead. But the administration really addressed that with this order because they announced it in a joint agreement with Canada. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government also is placing a hold on drilling. SHAPIRO: And today, what has the reaction been from the oil and gas industry? BRADY: Yeah, they're not happy with this. I talked with Andy Radford at the American Petroleum Institute, and he called this another in a long line of hits this administration has levied against the oil industry. He says this is going to hurt job growth and the economy, something we hear a lot from the industry when something like this happens. But in the end, Radford says he thinks President Obama's order to protect these areas will not stand. ANDY RADFORD: We just don't think this is a permanent thing. We think it can be undone with a simple presidential memorandum, and we'd like to see the new president do that when he gets into office. SHAPIRO: The White House currently says that can't happen. What's their rationale? BRADY: Yeah, a senior administration official says this order is based on a law from the 1950s. They say the law is very clear. I've read it. It's just a couple of sentences. And the White House says the president is acting within his authority, that presidents of both parties have done this in the past, and trying to reverse such an order would be unprecedented if President-elect Trump tried to do that. But there's also no case law on this, so if there's a legal challenge - and I'm not going to be surprised if there is one - it's really not clear what a court would decide. SHAPIRO: NPR's Jeff Brady, thanks a lot. BRADY: Thank you, Ari. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"December 20, 2016",Alabama Official Apologizes After Cutting Down Tree For Trump Rally," (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: This is our last rally, our last stop. And I just want to thank the people of Alabama, and I want to start by wishing you a very Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  And Dolly, a dog recorded today. (SOUNDBITE OF DOG BARKING) SIEGEL: And finally, the 50-foot cedar tree dividing them. SHAPIRO: The president-elect spoke at a stadium with a large tree behind him. That seasonal backdrop was decorated with Christmas ornaments, and it artfully obscured the scoreboard. Before the weekend, though, a very similar tree stood in a city park where Dolly takes her daily walks. DENISE GRIER: It's the only cedar tree in the park. SHAPIRO: That's Denise Grier, who owns the dog Dolly. And what she means is it was the only cedar tree in the park. GRIER: It had a lot of character to it. The trunk was very gnarly. It had a lot of curves. SIEGEL: When trucks and a crane arrived at the park Thursday morning, Grier suspected the tree would soon fall. GRIER: I thought they were clearing land, maybe for a new bathroom facility. SIEGEL: Well, now, a neighbor had tipped her off that the city was trying to find a tree for the Trump rally. But still, there was no guarantee this cedar would be the one. SHAPIRO: Well, after work on Friday, when the dog Dolly got her walk, the tree was gone. GRIER: And we didn't have time to gather around the tree and protest or anything like that. SHAPIRO: Indeed, it was the very same tree. An outcry followed, and the mayor's chief of staff apologized. Colby Cooper said he became overzealous while trying to ensure the expectations of Trump's team were not only met but exceeded. Cooper said that in the future, he will be, quote, ""more sensitive to the spectrum of concerns regarding trees."" SIEGEL: Denise Grier sees something other than remorse. GRIER: They just got caught is what happened, and they had to pretend like they were sorry. SIEGEL: The city said the wood from the tree was to be repurposed. But... GRIER: I drove over to Ladd Stadium. And yeah, they took the tree down all right. They cut it up. They tossed it in the back of a truck. I spoke with the supervisor of the crew, and he knew nothing about repurposing the tree. I think they were headed to a landfill with it. SHAPIRO: The city disputes that, saying the parks and rec department is still, quote, ""assessing the wood."" And for his part, Cooper has offered to have three new trees planted and pay for it himself. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"December 20, 2016",Democrats Face Difficult Path Forward After Bruising 2016 Election," The Republican Party is heading into 2017 on a high that they haven't felt in a long time. For the Democrats, it's a different matter. They lost the presidency. They failed to retake the Senate and the House, and they're struggling in state houses around the country. NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson has been thinking about what Democrats need to do in the New Year as they start to rebuild, and she joins us now. Hi, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Robert. SIEGEL: How bad are things for Democrats as they try to put 2016 behind them? LIASSON: Bad, bad, bad, bad for... SIEGEL: That bad. LIASSON: Yes, that bad. For all the success of President Obama, no president has lost more seats for his party in eight years than he has. Democrats right now have a trifecta - in other words, both state houses and the governor's mansion in only six states. Republicans have total control - a trifecta - in 26 states. So they're shut out in Washington. They are in a minority around the country, but they can still filibuster at least until Republicans change the rules completely. However, to put this into perspective, they won the popular vote. Their strength is among the parts of the electorate that are growing. So I would say the diagnosis is the Democrats have a gaping head wound. The Republicans are suffering from a longer-term demographic illness that might be fatal but is not as urgent. SIEGEL: So what's the first order of business for the Democrats in 2017? LIASSON: I think the first order of business is to get an economic message that can appeal to everyone, that can appeal to the young millennial who's saddled with college debt and the laid-off union worker. Don't forget. President Obama did this. Many Trump voters were Obama voters. This is always what Democrats did in the past. SIEGEL: Right. LIASSON: That's how Democrats have been successful. This is their DNA. They just have to get back to it. SIEGEL: I mean there is a controversial critique, though, of the Democratic Party that it's been putting the kind of unifying bread-and-butter issues that you've alluded to second and identity politics first and that by doing that, it's inadvertently intensified white, working-class identity politics. LIASSON: With a big assist from Donald Trump. SIEGEL: Yeah. LIASSON: Don't forget. He was the master identity politician this year. And yes, there's no doubt about that. There are a lot of Democrats who think they need to develop an economic nationalism without the nativism - so less emphasis on identity politics, more emphasis on economic growth that's more broadly shared. SIEGEL: So let's turn more tactically to the Congress right now. There are different theories about how Democrats there could oppose Donald Trump. They could try to obstruct him at all costs. They could look to be constructive in some way. Which is it? LIASSON: I think they're going to push back against Trump when he goes against their core values. Yes, it's possible that if he presents a big infrastructure program that truly creates a lot of jobs, they might want to work with him on that. There are a bunch of senators in red states, people like Joe Manchin or Heidi Heitkamp. They might be willing to work with Donald Trump on some things. But there are some red lines for Democrats. Medicare is one of them. And if the Republicans in the House in particular go ahead with their plans to privatize Medicare - their new buzzword is modernize Medicare - the Democrats will stop them. And also, overall, what they want to communicate to Trump voters who maybe once were Obama voters is that Trump is abandoning them. In other words, if you look at the first things on the Republican agenda, it's tax cuts mostly for the wealthy, getting rid of Obamacare and putting someone on the Supreme Court and getting rid of regulations. That doesn't sound like a real populist agenda. The other thing is, what you're not hearing from them, which is interesting - you're not hearing from them saying, our first job is to make Trump a one-term president, which is what Mitch McConnell... SIEGEL: Yes. LIASSON: ...Famously said... SIEGEL: About Barack Obama. LIASSON: ...About Barack Obama. SIEGEL: As you've said, Democrats were not just turned out of power in Washington, but also the Republicans have complete control of state houses in 26 states. That'll have some real political implications. LIASSON: Real political implications because in 2020, we're going to have another census. And after every 10-year census, we redraw congressional district lines. And who draws them - governors and state legislators. And that's why in 2010 when Republicans had their big, historic surge, took over a lot of state legislatures and governor's mansions, they redrew the lines that kept their congressional majority safe for the next 10 years. SIEGEL: In January, Barack Obama will complete his second term in the White House. Hillary Clinton - we assume her career is over at this point. Are the Democrats lacking for a leader of their party? LIASSON: The Democrats are lacking for a leader. The Clinton era is over. But I would argue that having a leader for the Democrats is not as important right now than a message, than infrastructure, than getting down-ballot candidates, refilling their pipeline. One thing that happens when you're wiped out in midterms - your seed corn is gone. All those people who were moving up the pipeline who will eventually become the leaders of the party - they are just wiped out. And they need to get an infrastructure that turns out their voters every two years, not every four. That has been the great failing of Democrats. SIEGEL: They have now won the popular vote in 2000, in 2008, in 2000. LIASSON: Six of the last 7 elections. SIEGEL: And yet in the off-year elections, they lose everything. LIASSON: They lose everything. SIEGEL: Sounds like the Democrats have lots of work to do. NPR's Mara Liasson - Mara, thanks. LIASSON: Thank you. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"December 20, 2016",How Running ExxonMobil Did (And Didn't) Prepare Rex Tillerson For Secretary Of State," This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. President-elect Donald Trump has generated plenty of news and controversy with his cabinet picks. And, today, we're going to focus on his nominee for secretary of state Rex Tillerson. Tillerson is the CEO of ExxonMobil where he's worked his entire career. At a time when climate change is an important global issue, Tillerson has spent years advancing the interests of a fossil fuel company that has at times aggressively funded attacks on climate change science. And at a time when U.S. relations with Russia are strained and intelligence officials say Russia sought to influence the presidential election, Tillerson's been deeply involved in Exxon's oil-drilling projects in Russia, and he has a personal relationship with President Vladimir Putin. Our guest is Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Steve Coll. He's a staff writer at The New Yorker reporting on issues of intelligence and national security in the U.S. and abroad. In 2012, he wrote a book about ExxonMobil called ""Private Empire: ExxonMobil And American Power."" He's written six other books and is dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at Columbia University. He spoke with FRESH AIR's Dave Davies. DAVE DAVIES: Well, Steve Coll, welcome back to the show. Rex Tillerson has worked at ExxonMobil his whole life. Tell us a bit about the corporate culture at ExxonMobil. What distinguishes it from other companies? STEVE COLL: Well, of the oil companies that descended from Standard Oil - the monopoly that John Rockefeller built up at the turn of the 20th century - ExxonMobil is closest to the original in the way it operates and in its culture and values. Rockefeller famously blended a - an ardent Protestant faith with a ruthless, capitalist ethos, and there's a lot of that echo at ExxonMobil today. Former officials when I was researching ""Private Empire,"" the book about the corporation, would say that as recently as the 1970s, it wasn't uncommon at ExxonMobil to open just a business meeting with a prayer. And there's still a strong focus on business competition and performance above all else. I think part of that is about the stability of the oil industry. ExxonMobil's one of the few corporations left in the United States where you really can work cradle to grave, and they operate that way. They recruit out of graduate schools focused on oil engineering and related skills. And then there's a sort of upper-out threshold five to seven years into your career. If you want to stay, you've got to get used to Exxon's rules and its very tight, internal culture. Everything is in a rule book, and you're expected to follow it. But if you do stay, you can stay for 30 years, retire with a defined benefit pension and and live quite comfortably. BYLINE: Yeah. Rex Tillerson himself was an engineering student at the University of Texas, right? You mentioned corporate rules. What kind of rules? COLL: Well, there's a document or a binder in every employee's office notoriously referred to as OIMS. I think it's - botched the acronym, but it essentially is an operating manual for your job. And it could be hundreds of pages, and it provides instruction, guidance for how you do everything from contract for pencils to park your car to negotiate terms to speak to the press - or in most cases not speak to the press. And it's a very engineering-led culture. So these are all folks who basically think there's an answer to the problem that arises from the way you work in drilling fields. How do you build wells? How do you get oil out of the ground? How do you build the pipeline? And also financial engineering - how do you measure returns on huge investments that they make in projects? Project engineering - how do you make sure you get on time and on budget? So these are very linear processes. They're all written down and documented. It's a global corporation, so they have employees working all over the world and part of the purpose of the rule book is to make sure that somebody taking on a project in Indonesia or in West Africa does it the same way they would if it were in Alaska or in Texas. BYLINE: OK. So Rex Tillerson, if confirmed, will be secretary of state, and he has a lot of experience in international business. Give us a sense of the scale of Exxon's international reach and, you know, the extent to which it could be regarded as a player on the level of a nation state. COLL: Well, I think it is a player on the level of a nation state. As I was researching the way it operates around the world, I came to think of it that way through interviews with leaders and competitors and employees in diverse countries. And then as I got to know ExxonMobil even better at its headquarters, I came to understand it's not just an outsider who might think of it this way. That's actually the way they see themselves. They see themselves as an independent sovereign in the world motivated by their devotion to their shareholders and their shareholders' interests. And they have the scale of a sovereign nation. They operate in more than 100 countries. The number varies from time to time. Their revenue before the oil price collapsed was in the order of $400 billion a year. And now it's more like 300, but that's still the size of the economy of South Africa. And they, I think, operate independently in a sense of foreign policy as well. That is they see their role in the diverse countries where they work as entirely independent, for example, of U.S. foreign policy. And they make decisions on the basis of what's best for ExxonMobil shareholders not what's best for the United States. BYLINE: Are there clear examples where Exxon's interest propelled them to a foreign policy in opposition to American foreign policy? COLL: Yes. I've mentioned two fairly recently during the Obama administration. So in Iraq, it was the policy of the United States government to promote national unity by encouraging international corporations and oil corporations to do their business with the central government in Baghdad to prevent fragmentation of an already stressed Iraqi state. But ExxonMobil decided to do independent business with the Kurdish regional government which basically said pay no attention to Baghdad. Come on over here. We'll give you a better deal. And ExxonMobil did that under Tillerson's leadership without consulting with the Obama administration in advance, and it was a big deal as a departure from the effort to get everyone to concentrate on Baghdad. And after they made their announcement, he scheduled a phone call with the State Department, and basically said, look, I had to do what was best for my shareholders and this was my judgment. A second more recent example involves Russia where after sanctions were imposed on the Russian government, the Obama administration tried to discourage corporate leaders from attending certain economic conferences that Vladimir Putin's government hosted. And Tillerson went anyway. And it wasn't a violation of sanctions or anything, but it was a symbolic defiance of what the Obama administration was trying to achieve. BYLINE: You know, you write that an oil company needs stability in the places it operates. It - drilling wells is expensive. It takes decades to get the return from them, so they want places that will be stable. So they have to - so Exxon has dealt with a lot of authoritarian regimes, some of which, you know, are ruled by dictators who enrich themselves. What's Tillerson's record when it comes to dealing with those kinds of governments? COLL: Well, he's been successful at making arrangements with authoritarian governments in many places in the world, certainly in Vladimir Putin's Russia, in West Africa, in Equatorial Guinea, in Chad and in other places across the Middle East. In Qatar, they have a strong presence, and elsewhere in the Gulf states, ExxonMobil's very active. You know, they also operate in more raucous environments. But, generally, they've had better success economic and business success in environments that are stable because of authoritarian government than in a place like Alaska where Tillerson has repeatedly expressed frustration that ExxonMobil can't get stable terms to the deals it wants to make because the government keeps changing. Well, that's because we have elections in Alaska, and politics of oil up there are pretty - you know, pretty raucous. So I'm not saying that that means he's anti-democratic, but I am just saying he's been conditioned by experience to work productively and without a lot of criticism or interference in politically authoritarian environments. BYLINE: You know, there are a lot of decisions that companies that work in - with authoritarian regimes have to make. And it's one thing to say, well, we're not going to, you know, seek the overthrow of an authoritarian regime. But there are other decisions you can make. You can participate in bribing officials or facilitating, you know, the extraction of large amounts of assets for the - for royal families. Do you have any sense of how Exxon and Tillerson's - any sense of their record in terms of the extent to which they violate things like the Corrupt Foreign Practices Act? And what's their... COLL: They're - they're... BYLINE: ...What's their record of integrity in that area? COLL: Well, we talked before about their rulemaking and their adherence to rules. And I do think that they use the law as a - as an organizing principle everywhere. And they're very - very devoted to trying to figure out how not to get outside of the law and also to promote the rule of law internationally because that aids their business model in the sense that it makes contracts enforceable. And it also gives them a way to avoid the kinds of dilemmas that are presented when dictators' relatives come around looking for contracts or for favors. ExxonMobil can say, hey, we follow the law everywhere. This is not legal. We're not going to do it. And so it's a way to be consistent. You know, where it gets more subtle is outside of the direct corruption of enabling capital flight or taking payoffs or making payoffs. You know, what do you do in these societies while you're there to promote better humanitarian conditions, better governance? Are you willing to take any risks to call out a host government on its domestic conduct, on its imprisonment of political-opposition figures, its suppression of journalists or human rights activists? There, ExxonMobil is very cautious on the whole. They have incorporated human rights principles in their own operations, their own security procedures. They were slow to do that, but they've done it quite thoroughly. But when it comes to trying to use their influence in a place like Chad to create different politics, better politics, they steer away from that. They tend to do relatively uncontroversial projects, like, say, promotion of public health, which is good but is sort of apolitical. BYLINE: Steve Coll is a staff writer at The New Yorker. We'll continue our conversation after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) BYLINE: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with Steve Coll. He is a staff writer at The New Yorker, reporting on issues of intelligence and national security in the U.S. and abroad. He's also the author of the 2012 book ""Private Empire: ExxonMobil And American Power."" We're talking about the nomination of ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson to be secretary of state. Tillerson has no diplomatic experience, but he's had a lot of experience as a - as a deal-maker in other countries. Has that honed skills that will be useful to him as secretary of state, do you think? COLL: Sure. I mean, the secretary of state has lots of different functions, but some of them - the day-to-day work - are quite similar to what Tillerson has done for 10 years at ExxonMobil. These include negotiating with foreign leaders about complicated subjects. They include digesting lots of political analysis, intelligence, and trying to figure out what's true, what's not, what it means for how to proceed. ExxonMobil has its own, essentially foreign policy apparatus at the headquarters - political analysts, intelligence analysts, some former U.S. intelligence and foreign policy-makers - who replicate the kind of inbox that you'd get as secretary for aiding decision making. And attending ceremonial events, he's done plenty of that. And assessing foreign leaders, trying to figure out how to get under their skin or how to get them to some place you want to move them - all of that is relevant. But here's the other half of the job. That involves not deals, but ideas. And it involves the diplomatic service of the United States, which is a career service spread out all over the world and which not only negotiates across the street with the host government, but also delivers and defines the aid, the resources that the United States provides in that country, whether it's support for local human rights groups or democracy organizers or whether it's through USAID, new technologies to help free speech and free organizing in authoritarian countries. You know, the United States is often the last outpost in faraway places for dissidents or minority religions or investigative reporters who come under pressure. And so the diplomatic service, the career service that he'll now lead, that's their ethos. That's why they came into the United States government in many cases. That's what they do out there, distributed across all these embassies and consulates. And so the odd fit is not the kind of tactical deal-making part. There, he's well suited. It's the, what does he think about all of this. He's never - he has no record of writing about these foreign policy issues from an American perspective as opposed to an Exxon perspective. BYLINE: And do we know anything about Rex Tillerson's views about, you know, the major conflicts in the world - you know, NATO, Israel and Palestine - or about his views of the use of American power? COLL: Not much about the ones you just listed. I think the other tactical issue that's certainly going to come up in his confirmation hearings involves sanctions as an instrument of foreign policy. So ExxonMobil has long lobbied against sanctions, both in principle and in lots of specific cases. They're opposed to them, Tillerson sometimes says, because he doesn't think they're very effective. But, of course, it doesn't take a lot of cynicism to see that ExxonMobil opposes them because they undermine ExxonMobil's business opportunities. And he has - ExxonMobil, in various stages, has argued against sanctions not only in Russia, which will be a controversy during the confirmation, but also previously in Iran and in Iraq - in Saddam Hussein's Iraq. They just basically don't want the United States to pressure other governments by constricting business opportunities. And it would be surprising if he came to office now, turning around and saying, actually, sanctions are an alternative to war that we really ought to prioritize and refine how to make them more effective. It's possible that he'll take that turnaround view, but it would be a real departure from ExxonMobil's policies. BYLINE: And what do we know about his beliefs about global warming and his record on climate change regulation? COLL: Well, ExxonMobil has, as a corporation, a pretty miserable record on climate change. They, during the 1990s and early 2000s, funded groups led by non-scientists to promote the idea that climate science was unreliable. And they've continued, from time to time, to support groups that continue to undermine climate science, even without scientists in the lead. But Tillerson's ascension to the top job in 2006 marked a change in the way ExxonMobil communicated about climate and climate science issues. He inherited this portfolio from his predecessor, Lee Raymond, who was a really ardent climate skeptic - very outspoken. At one point in 2000, he said publicly he thought it was more likely the world would get cold than it would get warm. He just didn't believe the science. And he really put ExxonMobil way out in front on this issue. It wasn't really an existential issue for ExxonMobil whether or not there would be a price on carbon. But Lee Raymond treated it as if it were. And so Tillerson came in. And he has said that he wanted to kind of reset ExxonMobil's communications about this. And he did. He started talking about climate in a different way. Yes, the risks are there. They're serious. We should take them seriously. Then in 2009, when it looked like there was a possibility that Congress might actually pass climate regulation in the form of a cap and trade bill that would impose a price on carbon fuels, Tillerson came out and said, I oppose that method of cap and trade because it's too complicated. But I now support a tax - a carbon tax. Twenty dollars a ton was what he said at the time, I think. And that was a big change. At least now they were saying that they, in theory, supported policies that would price carbon in order to reduce the risks of climate change. The problem is that seven years have passed. ExxonMobil really hasn't done anything to advance that position. And though they make statements taking note of how serious the international response to climate risks has become and they don't actively rhetorically oppose agreements like the recent one at Paris, they really seem to just be stepping back and not leading in this area. BYLINE: You know, in discussing his worldview, he said a few years ago his favorite book is the Ayn Rand novel ""Atlas Shrugged."" Not everybody remembers that. What - what does that tell us about his worldview? COLL: Well, that 1957 novel - sort of dystopian novel - has become a kind of touchstone for libertarians and skeptics of states - state power, government. It's often cited by folks who really think the government is the problem and that what's really required is individual initiative, individual virtue. And so yes, it's a very specific choice to have listed. It was in response to a question, I believe from a Boy Scout magazine, as to what his favorite book was. And he listed that one. So I think he comes to Washington not just as an outsider in his career, having never held a government position or served the United States government in that way, but maybe an outsider also in his mind about how effective the U.S. government is as an instrument of the interests of the American people. GROSS: We're listening to the interview FRESH AIR's Dave Davies recorded with Steve Coll about Rex Tillerson, the CEO of ExxonMobil, who is now Donald Trump's nominee for secretary of state. Coll is the author of a book about ExxonMobil and wrote a recent article about Tillerson in The New Yorker. After a break, they'll talk about how U.S. sanctions against Russia have affected ExxonMobil's interests there, and jazz critic Kevin Whitehead will remember some of the great jazz musicians we lost this year. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to the interview that FRESH AIR's Dave Davies recorded with Steve Coll about Rex Tillerson, who is Donald Trump's nominee for secretary of state. Tillerson is the CEO of ExxonMobil. Coll is the author of a book about ExxonMobil and wrote a recent article in The New Yorker headlined, ""Rex Tillerson: From A Corporate Oil Sovereign To The State Department."" Coll is a staff writer for The New Yorker and dean of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. BYLINE: So Tillerson's relationship with Russia and his personal relationship with Vladimir Putin is certainly an issue as people discuss this nomination. How long has he - has Tillerson been representing Exxon in Russia? COLL: Well, Exxon started to negotiate a deal that still is going on in Russia as far back as 1996. And Tillerson was certainly involved in the late '90s and early 2000s as he rose through the corporation toward becoming CEO. So really, I think, it's fair to say he's been in Russia for 20 or more years in and out. And when Putin came to power in 2000, that was the main partner that he needed to deal with and, certainly, during his time as CEO has dealt with extensively leading up to, you know, big agreements announced as recently as 2011, 2012 to explore in the Arctic - the Russian Arctic - a deal that had at least a top-line potential of $500 billion. So in short, he's been there for at least two decades. BYLINE: So give us a sense of the scale of Exxon's business interests and dealings with the Russian government. COLL: Well, I don't think they're decisive to ExxonMobil, but they have managed to do what a lot of international oil corporations have not which is to stay through all kinds of political weather. They have two big projects out in Siberia off the coast of Siberia that they partnered with Russian entities to carry out. And what Exxon brought to the table was advanced drilling and project management technology that could work in really, really harsh weather. You know, Russia has a lot of oil. It has a lot of mature oil fields that have been around for decades and decades. Russia doesn't need outside help with those. The next frontier for Russian oil production is in tough places toward the Arctic or out in Siberia, so that's what brought ExxonMobil in. But then what happens in Russia is that if you - if you're not careful, you'll get your lunch stolen. And a lot of corporations that have come in and done deals in the Putin era have ended up having to exit because of various conflicts with Russian tax authorities or different Russian oil interests that were close to Putin and got crosswise with the outsiders. And somehow Exxon has managed to hang in there, stay close to Putin, stay close to a guy named Igor Sechin who is the chief executive of Rosneft now, but was one of the original kind of hard men around Putin and has been critical to Putin's government really since it began. BYLINE: Rosneft is one of the Russian oil companies, right? And what do we know about his personal relationship with Putin? COLL: Well, not a ton, to be honest. I mean, we know they spent a lot of time together. They've successfully negotiated very complex, very ambitious agreements. We know that Igor Sechin has been a very important part of their relationship. We know that Tillerson is willing to demonstrate that he will defy the United States government by attending conferences that the Obama administration doesn't want him to go to. And one can imagine that a certain intimacy has built up over this long record of negotiations with a single leader in Putin. But what the real flavor of that is, I mean - it's behind closed doors. Neither the Russians nor ExxonMobil makes any of that transparent. An interesting question that may surface during the confirmation hearings is that Tillerson has had personal ties with two targets of American intelligence collection for a long time - Putin and Sechin. And anyone who knows how the world works would be aware that every conversation you have in Russia with either of those gentlemen is likely to be recorded both by the Russian government to use it against you if they can somehow and by the U.S. government to try to figure out what's going on and maybe by other governments as well. So I'm assuming that Tillerson has been smart enough over the years to manage his conversations and his presence in Russia with that in mind as if he were in a fishbowl, even though nobody else in the world knows exactly what was said. In fact, there are probably transcripts in both governments of many of these meetings. And so if he's made mistakes, if he's made terrible judgments from the perspective of a future secretary of state, it's possible that that will surface because there are plenty of bureaucrats in the U.S. system who would have had access to that material. BYLINE: I don't know - this is speculative - but can you imagine a way in which some of this information might come out? COLL: I think it would only come out on the U.S. side. I don't think the Russians have any motivation to put it out. They would much rather have someone they know, someone they've had successful negotiations with in power in Washington. Even if Tillerson becomes unfriendly to them on policy matters now that he's a public leader, at least they know how to deal with him and they have a record with him now. On the U.S. side, I think it would only come out if in that material there is something truly disturbing from the perspective of the candidate's judgment or his willing to accommodate Russian behavior that is, you know, outside the lines. BYLINE: And as the Senate considers his nomination - I mean, this does have to be approved by the Senate. Will they be able to talk to U.S. intelligence officials about any of this material? COLL: Yeah. I mean, they - the Armed Services Committee and the Senate Intelligence Committee can certainly ask questions. But the bureaucracies will make their own decisions about what's relevant, what's proper to share under U.S. law, how to summarize what they found. So there are regular channels. There are irregular channels, you know, how our system works. Journalism figures in that as well. But I think the bigger question that he's going to face a confirmation is going to come from senators like John McCain and other strong skeptics of Putin and Russia's foreign policy. They're going to want to know are your views as a public leader profoundly different from your actions as ExxonMobil CEO in accommodating these - this government? And if so explain yourself. So what do you think about the independence of Ukraine or the future of Ukraine? What do you think about the expansion of NATO that has brought the United States into solemn commitments to the independence of the Baltic states and vulnerable states in central and southeastern Europe? What do you think about Syria? What do you think about Russia's conduct in the Syrian civil war, these barbarian bombing campaigns deliberately targeting physicians and ambulances? How does human rights figure in American foreign policy in your mind? I mean, McCain is strong on global human rights as anyone in the Democratic Party. So, you know, there are issues of bipartisan foreign policy that really are uncomfortable when you overlay them with ExxonMobil's place in the world. And Tillerson has no record of speaking about that, so that's going to be, I'm sure, drawn out during his confirmation hearings. BYLINE: Steve Coll is a staff writer at The New Yorker. We'll continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) BYLINE: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with Steve Coll. He's a staff writer at The New Yorker reporting on issues of intelligence and national security in the U.S. and abroad. He's also the author of the 2012 book ""Private Empire: ExxonMobil And American Power."" ExxonMobil has some huge deals with Russia for drilling in Siberia, you mentioned, in the Arctic regions as, you know, the melting polar ice cap offers more access to oil deposits up there. When sanctions were imposed on Russia after the seizure of Crimea in 2014 - international economic sanctions - what impact did that have on Exxon's projects with Russia? COLL: It had an impact. It stopped them from going forward with this big framework agreement that they had signed with Rosneft, the Russian oil giant, to explore, as you say, in the Arctic taking advantage of the - particularly, the summer ice melt up there. So it meant that they had to stop business that they had committed to carrying out. And ExxonMobil publicly opposed the sanctions citing its long-standing and generalized belief that sanctions don't work. So yeah, it had a - it had an impact. BYLINE: So to be clear, I mean, Exxon has these huge, you know, multi-hundred billion-dollar projects in Russia that are affected by sanctions. The question is will Tillerson seek relief from those sanctions, which the company he spent his whole career at wants or does he take a different approach? COLL: It's very hard to imagine that Trump and Tillerson working together would have the political space in the U.S. to go upend sanctions without some major set of concessions on Russia's side. And yet, it's a situation without precedent to have a Republican president who is, essentially, if not pro-Russian, remarkably accommodating of a Russian dictator and a secretary of state who has never served in the government, never written in a foreign-policy journal about great power relations or the U.S. relationship with Russia but whose entire experience has been in business negotiations with the Russian state and its offshoots in the oil industry. So yeah, I think when you talk about appearances of conflict of interest, you can talk about it as an ethicist or as a lawyer in the White House counsel's office, but there's a broader picture here which is where are we going with Russia? And where is this leadership - what is it thinking about the kind of relationship that it wants the United States to have with Putin? And how much is it willing to accommodate Putin in the world? BYLINE: You know, when you wrote the book ""Private Empire: ExxonMobil And American Power,"" he did not grant you interviews, but you spent a lot of time talking to people who knew him. You asked him some questions at news conferences. I'm just wondering what sense you got of him and his - is he smart? Is he thoughtful? Is he rigid or open-minded? COLL: He's smart. He's thoughtful. He's comfortable in his own skin. He's a good communicator. He can take a lot of questions and bat them around. He's used to being in front of audiences. He's used to answering questions. But I've been thinking about this because ExxonMobil is such a controlled environment that when they put him out in front of audiences or he goes to the Council on Foreign Relations and gives a prepared speech and then takes five questions - generally, pretty friendly - you know, that's an environment that he thrives in. And I think, behind closed doors, he must be very effective. I've been at private dinners at think tanks where he's appeared. You know, he's at ease. He can talk with lots of different people about lots of different subjects. He doesn't come across as overbearing or, you know, sort of, arrogant. But he has never confronted the kind of uncontrolled questioning and impertinent questioning that a secretary of state has to face, not just all those ornery reporters in the back of your plane everywhere you fly asking you everything that might be newsworthy for their organizations. But, you know, the secretary of state - almost distinctively among those cabinet jobs - they fly all over the world, and they stand in front of the local press. They stand with the leader in front of all kinds of local activists. They meet with the opposition party. They wander around the embassy. And, you know, the career diplomatic service - these people are not always deferential to their leaders. They are independent minded themselves. They'll speak up. This is not Exxon's way. You don't speak up and call the - question the boss's fundamental assumptions in front of an audience. But this is what secretaries of state deal with all the time. And you look at the experienced ones, the ones who have been around this as politicians - John Kerry is a pretty good example - I mean, that stuff is just like rain off his back. He's so used to being under that kind of scrutiny and to taking unfriendly or bizarre questions from time to time. So it will be very interesting, if he is confirmed, to watch how he comes out of the very controlled environment of ExxonMobil into the raucous world of transparent politics. BYLINE: One more question on the subject of potential conflicts of interest - you know, it has been American policy to battle the effects of climate change. We don't know how that will - what that will look like under the Trump administration. But if ExxonMobil is undertaking to drill in the Arctic and areas where, you know, sea ice is melting and pursuing, you know, a policy that presumes many decades of use of fossil fuels, does that put him, potentially, at odds with an important policy goal of the United States? COLL: Well, I suppose it depends on what President Trump's policy goal is. But, you know, absolutely - he's made plain over his leadership of ExxonMobil, notwithstanding the adjustments in public policy and communication that he has overseen that essentially he's inclined to think, OK - there is a risk of climate change. It's a serious risk. We get it. We're at the table. We're listening. We're talking. But we don't want to do anything to prevent the development of global energy, including fossil fuel energy, that would somehow deprive, say, developing societies of burning all the coal they need to fire up electricity and deliver electricity to poor areas and so on and so forth. And then when you get to the climate risk subject, he's given answers from time to time where he says, well, look, OK - even if it is serious, we're engineers. We'll adapt. We'll find a way out of this. And that is the school of thought that, you know, used to be a little bit more prominent than it is today, which is kind of adaptation as the solution. Who knows what that adaptation is? Not, presumably, higher seawalls but some kind of technological magic bullet that resolves all of this rather than preventing it in the first place. Now, on the diplomacy of climate change today, the problem that the Trump administration is going to confront is that the Paris Accord represents a true international consensus about the seriousness of the problem and pathways to address it before we get to catastrophic temperature change. And if the United States essentially tries to undermine that or walk away from it, as Trump has occasionally threatened and as ExxonMobil's record would suggest Tillerson would be inclined to do, all it's going to lead to is isolation because really this question of climate risk in the world - it's a settled political issue. Only in the United States and Australia do you still have science deniers in such prominent roles. And if you want leverage in Europe, if you want leverage in the developing world, you'd better be engaging around this in a serious way. The Trump administration may decide that's just not their priority. They'll walk away, let it die by a thousand cuts or even more actively try to undermine it. But if Tillerson is the pragmatist that his friends and allies say that he is, he's going to want to take a hard look at where this consensus leads in terms of international politics and American influence. BYLINE: Well, Steve Coll, thanks so much for speaking with us. COLL: Thank you for having me.

npr,"December 20, 2016",LA Legal Defense Fund Created To Aid Immigrants Facing Deportation," City and county officials in Los Angeles on Monday unveiled a $10 million fund to provide legal services to immigrants facing deportation. They say they want the fund to be set up before Donald Trump becomes president. Cities across the country have been motivated to act after candidate Trump pledged to build a wall and deport 11 million people. An estimated 1 million immigrants without legal status live in Los Angeles County alone. Los Angeles and other cities are bracing for a crackdown on illegal immigration once Trump takes office next month. Los Angeles City Attorney Mike Feuer told the Los Angeles Times: ""The fund will ensure that there is 'more fairness and more effectiveness in the immigration system.' He cited statistics showing that immigrants who have representation have a better chance at succeeding in court."" The plan calls for half the money to come from public funds and about half from private foundations. Details weren't released on how the funds would be allocated. Mayor Eric Garcetti told The Associated Press: ""We don't know how far the new administration will go when it comes to our nation's immigration policy, but we've all heard the rhetoric, the dangerous rhetoric of the election. And we are ready to support people who can't afford or who don't realize they might need a lawyer."" Supervisor Hilda Solis' office told the Los Angeles Times that the county's board of supervisors is expected to vote Tuesday on allocating $1 million this budget year toward the fund. The Los Angeles City Council is expected to take up the issue when it reconvenes in January. The plan has its detractors, according to the Times: ""Some anti-illegal immigration activists criticized the move, saying it's a waste of taxpayer dollars and interferes with the federal government's immigration policies. ""L.A. officials 'should be focused on assisting the citizens, [not] taking tax dollars to pay for services to assist illegal residents countywide,' said Robin Hvidston, executive director of We the People Rising, a Claremont-based organization against illegal immigration. The money, she added, would be better spent on unemployed citizens, veterans, disabled and the elderly."" In northern California, officials in San Francisco also are considering plans to help fund legal services for immigrants. Earlier this month in Chicago, Mayor Rahm Emanuel announced the creation of a $1.3 million legal protection fund — in cooperation with the National Immigrant Justice Center. And in New York City, a public-private legal fund is being discussed that would build on a program already in place in the public defender's office.

npr,"December 20, 2016",Evangelical Leader Under Attack For Criticizing Trump Supporters," A prominent evangelical leader who harshly criticized Donald Trump during the presidential campaign now faces a backlash from fellow evangelicals who backed Trump. Russell Moore, who presides over the political arm of the Southern Baptist Convention, called Trump ""an awful candidate"" and criticized ""the old-guard religious right political establishment"" for supporting him, notwithstanding Trump's ""serious moral problems"" and a Southern Baptist tradition of opposing politicians whose personal behavior is considered un-Christian. ""The religious right,"" Moore argued in an October speech, ""turns out to be the people the religious right warned us about."" As president of the Southern Baptists' Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, Moore is in charge of his organization's policymaking and lobbying apparatus. Now Moore himself, as the ERLC leader, is under attack from some of the religious right figures he criticized during the campaign. ""Since Dr. Moore has taken over, there are a lot of things that are being said on various issues that the Southern Baptist people at large don't agree with,"" says Bill Harrell, the pastor emeritus at Abilene Baptist Church in suburban Augusta, Ga. ""It's developed into a very touchy situation, and it needs to be addressed in some way."" Harrell served on the SBC committee that created the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission more than 20 years ago. He says he has heard from other Southern Baptist leaders that the convention's links with the ERLC need to be reconsidered if Moore is to continue leading the group. ""There are a number of churches that I have heard of in the SBC, fairly large churches, that are going to withhold their funds from the ERLC,"" Harrell says, ""until this gets straightened out."" The Louisiana Baptist Convention, a state division of the Southern Baptist group, is among the organizations reconsidering its funding for Moore's commission. A resolution calling for a review of the links to the ERLC was referred to the Louisiana convention's executive board at a meeting in November. Among the conservative leaders now going after Moore is former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, himself a Southern Baptist pastor. ""I am utterly stunned that Russell Moore is being paid by Southern Baptists to insult them,"" Huckabee says. The controversy over Moore's leadership has even carried over into broader Christian circles. Janet Mefferd, a popular Christian radio broadcaster, thinks Moore unfairly criticized those evangelicals who stood by Trump in spite of his un-Christian tendencies. ""Most evangelicals that I've talked to became Trump voters late in the process, as their preferred candidates were not the ones who won,"" Mefferd told NPR. ""And I think Russell Moore has made the error of saying evangelicals who supported Trump are selling out their principles."" Moore, who holds firmly to conservative Christian positions on such issues as abortion and same-sex marriage, is now responding to the backlash he faces over his anti-Trump comments. In a new statement on his website, Moore says he did not mean to criticize all people who voted for Trump. ""If that's what you heard me say,"" he says, ""that was not at all my intention, and I apologize."" Indeed, some of Moore's Southern Baptist supporters are now speaking out. Dwight McKissic, pastor of Cornerstone Baptist Church in Arlington, Texas, applauds Moore for calling attention to Trump's alleged insensitivity to concerns about police brutality, an issue important to his African-American congregation, ""If they succeed in ousting Russell Moore, effectively we have become the Trump Baptist Convention,"" McKissic says, ""alienating the majority of the population. This is so short-sighted of them."" Support for Moore also comes from Darrell Bock, a professor at the Dallas Theological Seminary and former president of the Evangelical Theological Society. Bock worries that many evangelicals are too quick to vilify those who dare to expound a critical view, even those who share their own religious background, as Moore does. ""For some people,"" Bock says, ""there is so much tribalism in the divisions that we have that to speak against your tribe is to be seen as defecting from your tribe."" Bock sees his fellow evangelical Christians, and U.S. society generally, as standing now on a precipice, where things could either get very bad, or where people might begin to come together — if they recognize the importance of being able to engage with those who disagree with them. ""Where we've taken ourselves in the last few decades,"" Bock notes, ""is to the edge of this precipice, in which we are allowing this division to become so strong that our government can't even function."" Bock does not see last month's election as providing Trump a mandate. Pro- and anti-Trump evangelicals, Bock says, need to stop thinking about who won or lost and start talking to each other.

npr,"December 20, 2016",Trump's Doral Golf Course Highlights His Conflicts Of Interest," President-elect Donald Trump has financial stakes in hundreds of companies. But one line of business is particularly important to him: golf courses. He owns more than a dozen courses, which provide the Trump Organization with major streams of revenue and bolster his ""luxury"" brand image. But they also created conflicts of interest. As president, he will be able to steer environmental and labor policies that could boost the income from his golf courses. Take Trump National Doral. It's a huge luxury resort near Miami, and it provides a good example of how Trump's role as president and as businessman will come into conflict. The property is his biggest revenue generator, and appears to be a favorite of his. In October, just weeks before the election, Trump made a special campaign appearance at Doral. With a group of employees serving as his backdrop, he said: ""We're very proud of this. It's 800 acres in the middle of Miami. It's been a tremendous success."" Trump encouraged employees to step up and ""say a few words."" Several talked about how much they love working for Trump. But at Doral, and for clubs and golf courses around the country, new labor regulations promoted by the Obama administration are having an impact on how they do business. And many course owners aren't happy. Brad Steele explains why. He's the general counsel with the National Club Association, a trade group that represents country clubs and golf courses. Steele says the recession was tough on golf courses, and the recovery hasn't been easy. ""The last eight years have been relatively difficult for ... the private club industry,"" he says. Among the labor rules Steele and his members are most concerned about is one that greatly expands the number of workers eligible for overtime pay. It has been criticized by business groups and Republicans in Congress and was recently put on hold by a federal judge. It's a rule that Steele thinks will be targeted by the new administration. ""We are excited that now there'll be an administration that starts to look a little more ... critically at the impact that these kinds of things can have on business,"" he says. Amending the rule would have a direct impact on wages for employees at Trump's hotels, resorts and golf clubs. As such, it presents a potential conflict of interest. For Trump and his Doral resort, disputes over wages and overtime aren't just hypothetical. Rod Hannah is a lawyer who represented nearly 50 temporary workers who sued the Trump organization after not being paid for staffing a 10-day event at the resort in 2014. ""It was a combination of overtime and not being paid even their minimum wages,"" Hannah says. ""They were actually stiffed out of all of their wages."" The workers had been hired to staff a Passover event at the resort. After they weren't paid, Hannah sued the Trump Organization. Hannah secured a settlement, but only after a lengthy legal battle. ""Trump took a very hard-line, aggressive, defensive stance on the case up until the time we actually resolved it that they were not the employer of these individuals,"" Hannah says. In his arguments, Hannah cited a National Labor Relations Board ruling that makes it easier for employers to be held liable in disputes with workers hired by an outside contractor. It's a ruling Trump's designated labor secretary, Andrew Puzder, has said he wants changed. But it's not just labor laws that can affect golf-course profits. There are four golf courses at Trump National Doral and under a new federal rule, environmental regulations may increase. A new federal rule called ""The Waters of the U.S."" seeks to safeguard water quality by giving the Environmental Protection Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers authority over thousands of new waterways and wetlands. That's angered farmers, other landowners — and golf course owners. ""For golf courses across the United States, this particular rule now mandated that anytime a club were to place fertilizers or chemicals on property, it might actually have to have a federal permit,"" says the National Club Association's Steele. Trump has promised to repeal the rule. It's an action that would directly affect Doral and his other U.S. golf courses. ""By definition, it's a conflict of interest,"" says Trevor Potter, a former chairman of the Federal Election Commission and current president of the Campaign Legal Center, a government ethics watchdog group. He says that unless Trump sells his golf courses and hotels and sets up a blind trust, those conflicts will remain. ""The point that the Trump people have been making is, 'We're allowed to have a conflict of interest because we're the president and the conflict of interest statute doesn't apply to us,' "" Potter says. ""That doesn't mean there's not a conflict. There is."" Short of selling his holdings and creating a blind trust, Potter says Trump might turn over his businesses to an independent party not related to him — setting up a sort of ""firewall"" between Trump golf courses and the White House.

npr,"December 20, 2016",Trump's Immigration Plan Could Undermine Promise To Boost Economy," President-elect Donald Trump says he will double the nation's growth rate during his time in office. That promise will be difficult to keep. Trump isn't talking about a temporary boost in growth. He says he can make the economy grow in the long term at a rate of about 4 percent a year. Most economists think America's potential growth is only about 2 percent, and most agree the best way to make it higher is to get more people working and make those workers more productive. Stimulating the economy with government spending or tax cuts will only boost short-term growth and cause inflation. But right now, getting more people into the labor force is a challenge. For one, it means fighting a demographic tide. ""We have a huge wave of baby-boom era people retiring,"" says Robert J. Gordon, an economist at Northwestern University and author of The Rise and Fall of American Growth. ""Right now, we've got a shortage of construction workers. We've got a shortage of long-distance truck drivers. We've got a shortage of many kinds of skilled workers needed to work in manufacturing."" Gordon says bringing immigrants into the workforce is the best way to deal with this mass retirement of baby boomers. In the past couple of decades, half the growth in the labor force has come from immigration. But, Gordon points out, Trump has said he will deport millions of immigrants. ""They're called illegal immigrants, and they're here illegally,"" Trump said in an interview with CNN. ""They're going to have to go, and they're going to have to come back in legally, and otherwise, we don't have a country."" Those were chilling words for Jose Aguiluz, a 27-year-old operating room nurse at Adventist Hospital in suburban Washington, D.C. ""His rhetoric was very negative during the election, but now he has to contemplate and analyze reality,"" Aguiluz says. Aguiluz came to the U.S. at age 15 for a lifesaving surgery after a car accident in his native Honduras. After the surgery, he and most of his family stayed illegally. Then, in 2014, President Obama issued an executive order that provided two-year deportation deferments for young immigrants like Aguiluz. Trump says he will rescind that order. If he could talk to Trump, Aguiluz says, here's what he would say. ""I am a very contributing individual in the American society,"" he says. ""I save American lives in the OR. They don't care about my immigration status. They don't care if I'm a Latino. What they care is that I'm a very capable nurse that will carry them through the surgery."" In fact, about one-quarter of all the doctors and nurses in the U.S. are immigrants. Stephen Moore, who has advised Trump on his economic growth policy, says Trump isn't against immigration, just illegal immigration. Personally, Moore says he believes even some of those workers who are in the country illegally shouldn't be deported. ""People who are in this country, are working, and productive Americans who are contributing, I personally would not like to see those people deported,"" says Moore, who is also an economic consultant with FreedomWorks, the grass-roots organization that helped launch the Tea Party. He also argues that a faster growing economy will not only provide jobs for the unemployed but will attract others back into the labor force, including some retirees. Most economists are skeptical that could provide enough workers to get to a 4 percent growth rate. In terms of making workers more productive, Moore says big tax cuts for businesses will boost investment in new equipment and technologies, such as autonomous vehicles and artificial intelligence. ""We could see very rapid rises in the productivity that ... is a key part to making growth possible,"" Moore says. But Gordon, who has studied innovation, believes it will be several decades before those two technologies have much impact on U.S. productivity. And he notes that neither the big Reagan tax cuts nor the big Bush tax cuts boosted U.S. productivity. NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor ",http://www.npr.org/505743200
npr,"December 20, 2016",The Richest Administration In History Just Got Richer," President-elect Donald Trump is adding another billionaire to the top ranks of his administration. Trump plans to nominate a wealthy financial executive, Vincent Viola, to be secretary of the Army. Viola would be at least the fourth Trump nominee with a net worth in the billions. And that's not counting Trump's own 10-figure fortune. Viola is a West Point graduate who served in the 101st Airborne Division. The son of a Brooklyn truck driver, he made his fortune in the financial industry. Viola started working as a trader on the New York Mercantile Exchange in the 1980s and eventually became the NYMEX chairman. He is credited with helping the exchange quickly resume operations after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. The following year, Viola founded and bankrolled the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point. ""It is an honor to be nominated to serve our country,"" Viola said in a statement. ""If confirmed, I will work tirelessly to provide our President with the land force he will need to accomplish any mission in support of his National Defense Strategy."" Viola founded his own electronic trading company, Virtu Financial, in 2008. The company went public last year. Viola, who ranks 374th on the Forbes 400 list, also owns the Florida Panthers hockey team. Trump has chosen at least three other billionaires for top jobs in his administration. The president-elect, who campaigned as a champion for working people, insists there's no disconnect in assembling the wealthiest administration in history. ""You know the media was saying the people who are negotiating your trade deals are very rich,"" Trump told supporters in Orlando Friday. ""I'm saying, isn't that what we want?"" Some of Trump's nominees may have to sell off their investments to avoid potential conflicts of interest. In return, they could qualify for a valuable tax break. For example, if Andrew Puzder is confirmed as labor secretary, he might not be allowed to hold stock in the fast-food company he runs because the Labor Department polices that company's compliance with wage-and-hour regulations. If a nominee does have to sell investments to comply with federal ethics rules, he or she may be allowed to put off any capital-gains tax. That's a break designed to help new nominees avoid conflicts of interest without paying a personal price. ""If there were a tax penalty, there might very well be fewer Americans willing to serve,"" said Steven Rosenthal, a former staffer for the Joint Committee on Taxation. To take advantage of the tax break, nominees are required to invest any proceeds from a sale in assets that would be free from conflict, such as Treasury bonds or a broad-based mutual fund. That's ""to give Americans confidence that their civil servants would be acting in the country's interest and not their own financial interest,"" said Rosenthal, who now works for the Tax Policy Center. The Office of Government Ethics has warned that even though it does not have much purview over conflicts of interest for the president, it does have some say when it comes to Cabinet officials. ""OGE reviews their financial disclosure reports not only for their compliance with applicable disclosure requirements but also for conflicts of interests,"" the agency's director, Walter Schaub, wrote to Congress last week. The Office of Government Ethics could become a pain in the neck for Trump's cabinet appointees, especially considering their wealth pic.twitter.com/WsNAdnLaDI Former ethics lawyers for both President Obama and former President George W. Bush have encouraged Trump and his children to liquidate their investment in the Trump Organization. While the president is not strictly subject to conflict-of-interest laws, he is governed by the ""Emoluments Clause"" of the Constitution, which bars officeholders from accepting gifts from foreign governments without approval from Congress. Ethics lawyers Norman Eisen and Richard Painter warn that so long as the president-elect maintains his ownership stake in the Trump Organization — with its vast holdings in foreign countries — ""Trump would arrive in office as a walking, talking violation of the Emoluments Clause."" So far Trump has shown no inclination to sell his stake in the company. He does plan to turn over operational control to his sons Don Jr. and Eric, although details of that arrangement won't be made public until next month.

npr,"December 19, 2016","Donald Trump Secures Electoral College Win, With Few Surprises"," And on Monday, the result was ratified by Electoral College voters, who gathered in state capitols across the United States to formally vote for president. Trump secured 304 electoral votes — two fewer than he earned in November, according to the Associated Press, which tracked results from capitol to capitol. That was despite a pitched effort by some on the left who wrote letters to Trump electors trying to persuade them to switch their votes or not vote at all and keep Trump short of the 270 needed. Not only did it not happen, but more electors tried to defect from Hillary Clinton Monday than from Trump, by a count of eight to two. Three Democratic electors in Maine, Minnesota, and Colorado tried to vote for candidates other than Clinton. The electors' votes, however, were disallowed because of state rules binding them to the statewide popular vote winner. Four more electors in Washington state defected from Clinton. Three voted for Colin Powell and one for Faith Spotted Eagle, a Native American who gained some notoriety for her protest of the Dakota Access Pipeline. Breaking 4 ""faithless electors"" break ranks in Washington state electoral college vote. 3 vote for Colin Powell, one for Faith Spotted Eagle And in Hawaii, an elector successfully cast a ballot for Bernie Sanders instead of Clinton. Some of the Democratic electors tried to vote for Sanders, though only the Hawaii vote will remain an official Electoral College tally for the Vermont Senator. Others, including the Powell voters in Washington, were attempting to promote alternate Republican candidates that the House of Representatives could theoretically elect as president instead of Trump. The Electoral College gathering is usually a formality — a chance for political activists to gather amid pomp and circumstance to formalize their party's victory in each state. But the fact Clinton won the national popular vote by such a large margin, combined with the unconventional and unpredictable — and to many, threatening — way that Trump carried himself before and after winning the White House, led to an unprecedented effort to lobby electors to vote for someone else. Electors found themselves inundated by letters, petitions, tweets and Facebook posts, urging them to cast a ballot for an alternative candidate. Many received threats, as well. Many people behind the lobbying campaign cited a Federalist Paper written by Alexander Hamilton, which frames the Electoral College as a safeguard against ""foreign powers"" that try to ""gain an improper ascendant in our councils"" — a potentially relevant line, in the midst of revelations that Russia attempted to disrupt this year's election by hacking and releasing Democratic emails. Just in: Maine elector David Bright voting for @BernieSanders today. #mepolitics pic.twitter.com/AMPUkNog3e Hollywood celebrities even got in on the act, recording video pleas to electors. But, unsurprisingly, that effort had no effect on Trump electors. MN elector Muhammad Abdurrahman is deemed a ""faithless"" elector. Is dismissed and replaced. ""They don't understand us,"" said Pennsylvania elector Ash Khare. ""I received over 70,000 emails. I received over 5,000 letters. I received over 500 phone calls at all times of day and night."" But Khare, like most electors, is a longtime Republican political activist who was proud to cast a ballot for Trump. ""I've been an elector since 1996,"" Khare told Harrisburg public radio station WITF. ""But I've never been asked to do anything because we never won since 1988."" Maine elector David Bright announced Monday morning that he would cast a ballot for Sanders. But Bright ultimately changed his vote to Clinton, after his initial ballot was ruled out of order. A Minnesota elector, Muhammad Abdurrahman, tried to vote Sanders, according to Minnesota Public Radio reporter Brian Bakst. He was replaced by another elector who cast a ballot for Clinton.

 Anti-Donald Trump protesters rally outside the Pennsylvania Capitol Building before electors arrive to cast their votes on Monday in Harrisburg. Two Texas electors defected from Trump — one went for Ohio Gov. John Kasich, the other for former Texas Rep. Ron Paul. The Kasich defector, Chris Suprun, told The Hill beforehand his plans. Another Texas elector, Art Cisneros, resigned instead of voting for Trump. He spoke to NPR earlier this month. Many Republican electors dismissed the pleas to ""vote their conscience,"" pointing out that their consciences were perfectly fine with Trump. With protesters heckling from the gallery of Pennsylvania's House chamber, Pennsylvania elector Robert Gleason seemed to pointedly respond to their efforts. ""My fellow electors,"" Gleason said, ""let us always remember this shared moment when we stood up for our constitutional system, followed our conscience, answered the call of Pennsylvania voters, and did our part by electing the next president and vice president of the United States, Donald Trump and Mike Pence."" On Monday night, Trump issued a statement saying, ""today marks a historic electoral landslide victory in our nation's democracy."" In fact, in nearly 80 percent of previous presidential elections, the winning candidate earned a larger share of the electoral vote than Trump. There are two more steps in the process. States will submit a ""certificate of vote"" to the Federal Register by Dec. 28. Then, on Jan. 6, Congress will formally tally the Electoral College's votes in a joint session and make it official.

npr,"December 19, 2016",Arizona Law Targets City Governments By Cutting Off Funds," As we mentioned, one place this is very evident is Arizona, and Jude Joffe-Block of member station KJZZ has this report on the conflict taking a new turn. JUDE JOFFE-BLOCK, BYLINE: Some of Arizona's cities are pretty liberal, and they've been considering policies like paid sick leave and requiring buildings to measure energy use. But the conservative state legislature has passed state laws to block those efforts. When one city passed a ban on plastic bags at grocery stores, the legislature banned cities from banning plastic bags. Republican State Senator Steve Smith says it's his job in the legislature to intervene if there are local policies that could be bad for all of Arizona. STEVE SMITH: We want as little government involved in our lives as possible on all levels, but sometimes you have to - you write a law to undo a bad one. JOFFE-BLOCK: Smith is annoyed because he thinks some cities are flouting state law anyway. For example, Tucson has some local gun safety ordinances. Smith believes they violate an Arizona law that says gun regulation can only be set at the state level. SMITH: And you effectively had a thumbing of the nose saying from this city, well, that's just the way it's going to be. JOFFE-BLOCK: So Smith and his Republican colleagues passed a new preemption law this year they say will force cities to follow Arizona law. It says any city with a policy that violates state law will lose its share of revenue from the state, which is critical to city budgets. SMITH: And if I get a ticket because I willingly disobeyed to follow one of the laws, then I deserve it. If a city or town willfully and knowingly disobeys state law, then they're going to pay the consequences of it. JOFFE-BLOCK: This new law escalates the existing fight over state preemption here, and the threat to city funding has mayors around Arizona really angry. GREG STANTON: It's illegal and - but more importantly, it's just unacceptable. JOFFE-BLOCK: Greg Stanton is the mayor of Phoenix and a Democrat. He says the new preemption law is really about partisan politics - conservative legislators trying to block liberal local policies they oppose by threatening crucial funds. STANTON: And if they don't like the public policies that I'm supporting in the city of Phoenix, blast me in the media. Take a shot at me. That's great. That - let's have a good public debate about those issues, but don't threaten our police officers and firefighters in losing resources as a result of that. JOFFE-BLOCK: One of Tucson's gun ordinances is the first city policy to be scrutinized under the new state preemption law. The ordinance says Tucson police should destroy certain abandoned and seized guns rather than resell them. It's now before the Arizona Supreme Court to decide if that ordinance conflicts with Arizona's state law - at stake, all of Tucson's shared revenue from the state. MIKE RANKIN: And for the city of Tucson, that's a big number. It's over a hundred million dollars per year that we get in state-shared revenues. JOFFE-BLOCK: Mike Rankin is the Tucson city attorney. He says Tucson's gun ordinance is lawful because the state constitution gives charter cities the authority to decide local matters like city property. The city has vowed to defend its ordinance in court, but the new law was written to discourage that. It requires the city to post a bond of over $50 million just to fight the case, which troubles Rankin. RANKIN: Because we believe that's an unconstitutional bar from our ability even to go into court and defend our own rights. JOFFE-BLOCK: Rankin filed a separate lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the new state preemption law. But even as Tucson fights this new law in the hopes it will be struck down by the courts, Councilman Steve Kozachik says he expects other Republican-controlled states to try to pass similar laws. STEVE KOZACHIK: And Arizona is ground zero for it. We're the first. But don't be fooled. This is happening in states all over the country, and we just happen to be the first one in line. JOFFE-BLOCK: After all, Arizona is often a trendsetter for state policy. For NPR News, I'm Jude Joffe-Block in Phoenix. SHAPIRO: And back to our state politics editor Brett Neely here in the studio. From listening to her story, it sounds like many more of these fights to come in 2017. BRETT NEELY, BYLINE: Yeah, absolutely. The political dynamics just make these kinds of fights inevitable, and here's why. I mean about half of the states now are fully-controlled by Republicans - governor and the legislature on down. And meanwhile, Democrats are just locked out of power at the state level. There's just a handful of states where Democrats have that kind of control. But at the city level, they're very, very strong. For example, 22 out of the country's 25 biggest cities are run by Democrats and often increasingly very liberal Democrats and interested in policies like paid leave and increasing the minimum wage. So this is a story that NPR and our member stations - we're going to be exploring over the next year as we focus more of our coverage on state politics. SHAPIRO: That's Brett Neely who edits state politics and government for us. Thanks, Brett. NEELY: Thank you. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"December 19, 2016",Political Battle Escalates Between Cities And State Governments," While the presidential election got the most attention in the political world this year, there was also a big political story at the state level - confrontations between some liberal city governments and conservative state governments. In a moment, we'll hear how this is playing out in Arizona. First, NPR's state politics editor Brett Neely is here for the big picture. And Brett, describe what we've been seeing. BRETT NEELY, BYLINE: Well, I've been working with a group of NPR member station reporters all year, covering the election. And almost every time I talk to them, you would hear a story from one of these reporters saying, there's this conflict in my state, and it's between the legislature and, you know, the mayor or the city council of the city. And so here's what all these instances had in common. It was always a Republican-controlled state, and it was a liberal city. SHAPIRO: Everybody I think is familiar with one example of that happening in 2016 in North Carolina with the bathroom bill, as it was known. NEELY: Yeah, so this all started in Charlotte where the City Council passed a bill - a pro-LGBT rights bill that allowed transgender people to use the bathroom that corresponded with their gender identity. The state legislature disagreed. They passed legislation that said that that was not within the rights of city governments to pass LGBT anti-discrimination bills. They went even further in fact and then said that people in North Carolina had to use the bathrooms that corresponded with their birth certificate instead of their gender identity. And this became a huge political issue. There were boycotts of the state, demonstrations. SHAPIRO: And how did that resolve? NEELY: Well, actually just today we are seeing some resolution. The Charlotte City Council has repealed the ordinance in question, and the North Carolina legislature is about to go back into a special session a little bit later this week where they're planning to repeal the statewide law - HB2 as well. The result of that will be basically that for LGBT North Carolinians, they'll be back in the position they were about a year ago where there are no protections in Charlotte. But on the other hand, you also won't have this state bill that has, you know, what some people found to be onerous requirements about what bathroom they used. SHAPIRO: When you look nationally at these clashes between liberal cities and conservative states, is it just a political-ideological difference between Republican and Democratic, or is it sort of a rural-urban difference? NEELY: It's a lot of both, in fact. In some ways, both parties have become much more ideological. They're headed in very, very different policy directions. We're seeing that very starkly right now with the incoming Trump administration. And there has always at the state level been a tension between rural and urban voters. But what we're really seeing now is that as rural voters become much more Republican and Democratic voters are really clustered in cities, those divisions are becoming even starker. And it's affecting all kinds of laws - social issues, minimum wage, environmental laws. And in fact, there is even a law in Ohio about the regulation of puppy mills. Copyright © 2016 NPR.

npr,"December 19, 2016",FairVote Executive Director Advocates For Electoral College Reform," ROB RICHIE: Thank you, Robert. SIEGEL: You support the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, a proposed reform. Can you describe what that is? RICHIE: Yes. It's a really intriguing, exciting reform that is grounded in the fact that it's states that really control what happens with the Electoral College. It's not Congress under the Constitution. So using that power, states are entering one by one by passing a law an interstate compact to make an agreement. And the goal is to have the candidate with the most popular votes in all 50 states and D.C. always win the election. And the mechanism is for all these compacting states that participate in it to agree to give all of their electoral votes to the winner of the national popular vote and to wait until they do it until they control the Electoral College by having a majority. And at that point, all of those states will give all their electoral votes to whoever wins the popular vote in every election. And so whoever gets the most votes on election night will win the election. SIEGEL: And you wouldn't actually need all of the states in the union to participate for that result to take place. RICHIE: That's right. It's just states representing a majority. Ten states and D.C. have done so, so it has 165 electoral votes in the compact. And we're waiting to get up to 270 before it kicks in. SIEGEL: Since you are an opponent of the Electoral College obviously, how do you answer the argument that if we relied on the popular vote, presidential campaigns, instead of obsessing over Florida, Ohio and a few battleground states, would obsess over California, New York and a few other major media markets instead? RICHIE: Well, the way we can know that's not true is that popular vote elections are really not a mystery. We use them for everything else. And if you talk to candidates that win governors races and congressional races where the popular vote determines the outcome, they don't ignore voters. Every votes in play, and if it's close, you're foolish to not aggressively try to get people to participate wherever they are. SIEGEL: There's an argument in favor of the Electoral College that goes this way. A given state or region might run elections that are corrupt the way old big city political machines famously did or undemocratic the way the Jim Crow South did for many years. But the state-by-state system at least limits the damage that any particular abusive system can do to the boundaries of that state. How do you answer that? RICHIE: One, it's pretty low-bar. Let's hope that we can run elections that are fair for everything 'cause we care about the results for Senate and House and everything else, too. I think that the current system in fact makes that quite a problem because the result can come down to one or two states. And if you distrust what's happened in one or two states, that really is magnified to affect the whole country. Popular vote margins tend to be quite big. In fact there's only one that's been less than half a million for more than a hundred years. And so that's a lot of votes to expect to be sort of fraudulently cast. But if it's only 500 or so votes in Florida that decides the election, people might have distrusted the outcome a lot more than what the popular vote margin was. SIEGEL: Now, you say the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact - to be a plausible system for the next presidential race, I guess you need about 110 more electoral votes. RICHIE: Yeah - 106 to be precise. You know, it's in play. This election has create a lot of passion, you'll be able to recognize. And I think the underlying problem happens in every election, which is that the candidates spend all their time, all their money, all their attention and polling on just a dozen states and really doing nothing in 38 states. And I think that's the problem that ultimately will be the reason that we go to a popular vote plan. SIEGEL: Among the states that have approved it, are - and the District of Columbia - are any of them Republican states? RICHIE: There have been Republican chambers that have passed it. It passed the Arizona House this year. It didn't go all the way, but it did pass the Arizona House. It's passed the Oklahoma Senate a couple years ago. We'll have to see the implications of this election, but we have seen a - kind of a growing cohesion where people of both parties were able to support it. And we'll just have to see what this election has done for that. SIEGEL: Rob Richie, executive director of FairVote and supporter of the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, thanks for talking with us. RICHIE: Thanks so much, Robert. Copyright © 2016 NPR.

npr,"December 19, 2016",Electors Cast Votes To Officially Name Nation's Next President," Donald Trump was elected president of the United States today again. The Electoral College gathered in state capitols across the country to formalize the results of last month's election. As NPR's Scott Detrow reports, they did so under unprecedented scrutiny. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: In Pennsylvania, Secretary of State Pedro Cortes began the Electoral College proceedings by explaining some history. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PEDRO CORTES: Under our federal system, the people of the United States vote for electors who in turn vote for the president and vice president. DETROW: It's a process that got far more attention this year than ever before. Take Hillary Clinton's nearly 3-million-person popular vote lead. Add in questions about Donald Trump's temperament and platform plus evidence Russia tried to influence the election, and you've suddenly got a widespread push to get the electors to overturn the results and vote for someone else. Even celebrities like notable fictional president Martin Sheen got in on the act. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MARTIN SHEEN: Republican members of the Electoral College, this message is for you. DETROW: But Republican electors didn't listen. In state after state, they voted for Trump. All 20 Pennsylvania votes went for the Republican, disappointing protesters like Julia Allen, who camped outside the state capitol overnight. JULIA ALLEN: We weren't thinking that all of them were going to switch over, but we thought maybe even one or two would take this opportunity to vote with their conscience. ASH KHARE: They don't understand us. DETROW: Ash Khare has been a Pennsylvania elector since 1996, but he had never gotten to vote because a Republican had never won. KHARE: I received over 70,000 emails. I have received over 5,000 letters. I have received over 500 phone calls at all times of day and night. DETROW: But Khare says he was proud to vote Trump. In fact after all the attention, far more electors tried to defect from Clinton than Trump. Maine elector David Bright tried to vote for Bernie Sanders to send his supporters a message. DAVID BRIGHT: I want them to know that some of us were listening. Some of us appreciated them. We understand their disappointment. DETROW: Electors in Colorado and Minnesota tried to vote for other candidates, too, but in all three states, those votes ended up going to Clinton. Four Washington state electors did go rogue. Those were votes that Clinton, not Trump, would have earned. Scott Detrow, NPR News. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"December 19, 2016",Charlotte City Council Repeals Ordinance That Led To Bathroom Bill," A political fight in North Carolina is coming to an end for now. Outgoing Republican Governor Pat McCrory said today that he would call a special session to repeal what is known as the state's bathroom bill. Among other things, it prevents transgender people from using the public restroom that they prefer. Joining us now is Jeff Tiberii of member station WUNC. And Jeff, this morning before McCrory's announcement, the Charlotte City Council repealed its LGBT anti-discrimination ordinance. What do those two developments taken together mean for LGBT rights in North Carolina? JEFF TIBERII, BYLINE: Well, for LGBT folks in this state, things are back to where they were nine months ago or a year ago. That means there's no city law protecting individuals who are transgender within the city of Charlotte or really anywhere else in this state. But now there also won't be a state mandate that requires people to use the bathroom corresponding to the sex listed on their birth certificate. And the law - the bathroom bill, as it's known - also House Bill 2 - it also prevented cities from passing nondiscrimination ordinances of their own. And for now, that ban is lifted. SIEGEL: Businesses, sports leagues, musicians boycotted North Carolina after Governor McCrory signed that state law, HB2. What sort of impact will repealing it have on the state's economy? TIBERII: Well, since its passage during a special session back in March, the economic impact has truly been significant. PayPal halted a plan to expand 400 jobs here. A number of concerts and conferences were canceled. There was also a sports hit. The NBA relocated its All-Star Game. The NCAA removed March Madness men's tournament basketball games from here. So that's what has happened. We don't know yet what the reverse effect of this bill will be. Does it open the door again for PayPal and the NBA and performers or does, you know, the stain of this legislation kind of linger for a while? SIEGEL: Politically speaking, North Carolina is deeply divided. Is there any reason to think that repealing this law is going to ease any of its political tensions? TIBERII: The law has been incredibly divisive for, you know, most of the year. It's worth noting that outgoing Republican Governor Pat McCrory was really a champion and a cheerleader of this measure. He defended it for months while criticizing, you know, the radical media and the activists who were backing it. But it's, you know, worth noting; Donald Trump won comfortably here last month, and McCrory did not. The timing of all this - this potential repeal - is fascinating. Last week, Republican lawmakers did convene a special session, stripped the incoming Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, of some of his would-be executive authority. Now, Cooper is taking some credit for making this repeal effort happen even as he lost power before taking office. And Republicans get to shift the focus away from what had been, you know, last week called this last-minute power grab. And it's worth also noting; Republicans will hold super majorities in the legislature next year. And with a Democratic governor, I think the infighting and, you know, the political gamesmanship will continue. SIEGEL: That's Jeff Tiberii of WUNC in North Carolina. Jeff, thanks.

npr,"December 19, 2016",Trump Pressured To Acknowledge Russian Election Interference," STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  We say something of a bipartisan consensus because lawmakers do not necessarily agree exactly how to investigate. And the consensus does not yet include President-elect Trump. He has said he does not believe claims of Russian involvement, although his incoming chief of staff said over the weekend that Trump would be ready to accept that conclusion if intelligence agencies put out a joint report. The president-elect's adviser Kellyanne Conway expressed the Trump team's impatience to John Dickerson of CBS. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""FACE THE NATION"") KELLYANNE CONWAY: John, where's the evidence? Why, when CIA officials were invited to a House intelligence briefing last week, did they refuse to go? Instead, they're talking to the media. That undermines our national security, our intelligence operations. INSKEEP: Let's talk about this now with Jonah Goldberg of National Review, who has become a regular guest here. Good morning, sir. JONAH GOLDBERG: Great to be here. Thanks for having me. INSKEEP: Thanks for coming by. So I just want to mention, Senator John McCain was on NPR the other day said, quote, ""I don't think there's any doubt about that, that it was Russian."" We could argue about what Russia's motives were in hacking the Democratic National Committee and other targets, but he doesn't doubt it. And there was a joint statement of all the intelligence agencies back in October saying this was Russia. Why is that basic fact a matter of dispute? GOLDBERG: I think it's a matter of basic dispute because we are in such an unbelievable hothouse of partisanship on both sides, where everyone wants to make maximalist claims. And so Democrats want to say that Vladimir Putin gift-wrapped and handed the election to Donald Trump. And Donald Trump and his subalterns want to say that Russia had absolutely nothing to do with this - say it was all his great populist movement. And it was probably some, apparently, apocryphal fat guy on a bed somewhere in the Midwest who had - who did all of the hacking. INSKEEP: And we should be clear - President Obama in our interview last week did not necessarily claim that Russia swung the election here. He actually seemed to blame the media for embracing a bunch of things he viewed as distractions. Rather than saying that it was Russia specifically, he wanted to look more broadly at the democratic process and how it's functioning. GOLDBERG: Right. And I also thought President Obama was fair in that. I think that's the problem when both sides want to make these maximum claims - is that their more humble claims - their more, you know, skeptical claims are actually pretty persuasive. The Democrats have every reason to be ticked off about how Russia, a foreign government, meddled with our elections. Every American actually, I think, should be very angry about that. And we should have investigations. On the flip side, I think the Trump team is perfectly in their rights to say - hey, look, it wasn't Vladimir Putin who told Hillary Clinton not to send anybody to Wisconsin. So if they could dial it down a little bit... INSKEEP: And it wasn't Vladimir Putin who actually voted here. Americans voted, and this is how the election turned out. GREENE: That's right. GOLDBERG: Fair enough. That's right. INSKEEP: Now President Obama did raise another thing, though. You mentioned that Democrats seem angrier about this than Republicans. The president said he was shocked to see a survey - and there was one survey saying this - 37 percent of Republicans have a favorable view of President Putin who, as Obama said, crushed democracy in his country and has defied the United States around the world. I think you could find surveys finding even more Republicans supportive of Putin. What is happening in the Republican Party there? GOLDBERG: Well, I mean, this is one of my problems I have with the way we do these things in Washington. Whenever you have one party being hypocritical, odds are the other one is, too. (LAUGHTER) GOLDBERG: So the Democrats who've been against - who've been for sort of detente or better or peace with Russia for a gazillion years... INSKEEP: Tried for the reset at one time. GOLDBERG: Right. INSKEEP: Sure. GOLDBERG: And Republicans who've been hard-liners towards Russia for a gazillion years, there's - because the Republicans are now becoming sort of soft on Russia, Democrats are sounding harder on Russia. I think what's happening is that we're seeing a flocking towards whatever position Donald Trump takes. And we've seen this time after time on things like Obamacare, health care, industrial policy, imminent domain, if you go down a very long list. If Donald Trump is for it, a significant portion of the Republican Party is going to be for it, too. And I think one of the reasons why you see people like John McCain and Senator Lindsey, or Lindsey Graham as lagging indicators in that movement is that elites are in some - have always sort of been the last to flip on these various issues when Trump went a new way. INSKEEP: Should Americans be concerned about Rex Tillerson, the Exxon Mobil CEO, who's the president-elect's choice for secretary of state and who does seem to have done a lot of close business deals with Russia? GOLDBERG: I think Rex Tillerson is getting a bad rap here. At the same time, if life - if the worst thing to happen to this multimillionaire CEO of a global giant is that he's used as a political pawn, I mean, I have to get a smaller violin. The problem is is I think he's an honorable, decent man from the people I've talked to. At the same time, the pick was so clearly symbolic as a rapprochement, as a move towards friendlier relations with Russia. And in the context of all of this other stuff, it is completely understandable that politicians would see this as a symbolic move towards Russia. INSKEEP: Meaning that Russia might get the wrong impression from this this choice? GOLDBERG: I think once Rex Tillerson is sworn in, he will actually be a remarkably patriotic guy who puts American national interests first. INSKEEP: Just got a few seconds here, Jonah Goldberg, but I read this conservative writer from time to time named Jonah Goldberg who... GOLDBERG: I've heard of him. INSKEEP: ...Who wrote something over the weekend called ""Never Trump No More."" What did you mean by that very briefly? GOLDBERG: Very briefly, all I meant was that the Never Trump movement, such as it was, was about the primaries and the general election. It said I'm never going to endorse or vote for the guy. INSKEEP: Which you didn't. GOLDBERG: I didn't. It doesn't mean that I have to dispute the legitimacy of a democratic election. My position has always been, I'm going to tell the truth as I see it. I'm very skeptical about Trump's chances for a brilliant, successful presidency. But he also deserves his shot. We only have one president at a time. INSKEEP: He's your president. GOLDBERG: He's everybody's president. INSKEEP: OK. Jonah, thanks very much. GOLDBERG: Thank you. INSKEEP: Jonah Goldberg of National Review. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"December 19, 2016",Former Ambassador Locke On The Future Of U.S.-China Relations," President-elect Donald Trump tweeted over the weekend that the seizure was an unprecedented act. And later, Trump tweeted that China should just keep the drone. China says it is giving it back. Gary Locke was U.S. ambassador to China from 2011 to 2014. And he said, beyond this drone incident, he's concerned about some of what Donald Trump has said about China. GARY LOCKE: We need to make sure that whatever we're doing is purposeful, deliberate and thought-out. Mr. Trump has indicated that he wants to impose almost-45-percent tariffs on all Chinese goods coming into the United States day one. Well, if Mr. Trump imposes tariffs on even a few items, the Chinese will turn right around and impose tariffs on those U.S.-made goods going into China. And that's going to make those products so much more expensive that those Chinese consumers aren't going to buy American products. And that's going to hurt a lot of Americans making those things in the United States, whether it's our soybeans or whether it's MRI machines or whether it's Boeing airplanes. So we could end up with a trade war. And in a trade war, no one wins. And the people who really lose are the consumers and the people making these items on both sides of the border. GREENE: You're talking about a lot on the line and a lot at stake in this relationship. I mean, a moment like this with this drone feels very tense. But is it the kind of thing that really could put all of that at risk, or is it likely that these two countries will sort of just move through this, and things will settle back down? LOCKE: Well, President Obama's still in office for another month or so. And so I'm sure he and his team are trying to sort out this issue with the underwater drone and try to get that back. And... GREENE: I hear you saying almost a thank goodness that President Obama is still in office to deal with this and not Donald Trump. Is that what you're saying? LOCKE: Well, we need to make sure that we're able to resolve this before Mr. Trump gets into office. And then, of course, hopefully, by then, he will have a full team in place that can really work through these issues and advise him and make a considered, collective judgment. GREENE: Ambassador, I mean it's - once we get through, you know, another month or so, it will be Donald Trump dealing with moments like this with China. I know you had your tense moments when you were the ambassador. Chen Guangcheng, the human rights activist, holed up in the U.S. embassy when you were there to try and get him and his family to the United States. Do you have any advice for Donald Trump on when these moments of tension arise - how to be tough enough? But also make sure things don't really explode. LOCKE: Well, that's why it's very, very important that you have a good team surrounding the president. People in the White House and the National Security Council, his advisers - as well as in the State Department, who then are working together, communicating together, bringing together all the information and sitting down in that Situation Room or in the Oval Office and walking through these things, talking them through, understanding the consequences and then making a decision. GREENE: Based on what you've seen from Donald Trump so far, do you see any reason for hopefulness that that he might do something to improve this relationship? LOCKE: Well, I know that he has a lot of business dealings in China. And I hope he understands the importance of trade with China, that we benefit. The Chinese people benefit. And I hope that, based on, you know, the travel that he's made and the travel of his family - that he'll understand just how intertwined our two countries are and how important it is for our two countries to work together to solve not just the problems facing China or the United States but, indeed, the problems facing the world. GREENE: OK. Gary Locke was United States ambassador to China from 2011 to 2014. Ambassador, thanks so much. LOCKE: My pleasure. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"December 19, 2016",Obama Warns Trump Against Relying On Executive Power," In an interview with NPR's Steve Inskeep airing on Morning Edition, Obama made it clear it's not the approach he preferred. ""My suggestion to the president-elect is, you know, going through the legislative process is always better, in part because it's harder to undo,"" Obama said. It's a lesson weighing on his mind as Trump's incoming administration has vowed to reverse many of the steps Obama took through executive order and administrative rules. ""Elections mean something"" The Obama administration's efforts to increase overtime pay, curb the carbon dioxide emissions of power plants and protect people living in the country illegally from deportation are all suddenly vulnerable. That's something Obama said he accepts: ""If he wants to reverse some of those rules, that's part of the democratic process. That's, you know, why I tell people to vote — because it turns out elections mean something."" Obama told NPR that Trump is ""entirely within his lawful power"" to sign new executive orders of his own. ""Keep in mind, though, that my strong preference has always been to legislate when I can get legislation done. In my first two years I wasn't relying on executive powers because I had big majorities in the Congress and we were able to get bills done, get bills passed. And even after we lost the majorities in Congress, I bent over backwards consistently to try to find compromise and a — a legislative solution to some of the big problems that we've got."" Obama pointed to immigration, saying he ""held off for years in taking some of the executive actions that I ultimately took in pursuit of a bipartisan solution."" He was referring to a big immigration reform package that was crafted by a bipartisan group of senators and passed the Senate in 2013, only to be stalled in the House with objections from conservatives, in particular to the ""path to citizenship"" that the bill would have provided for many in the country illegally. The White House promised at the start of 2014 that it would be a ""year of action"" after being frustrated by Congress, particularly since 2011 when Republicans took control of the House and had enough votes in the Senate to sustain filibusters. ""I've got a pen, and I've got a phone,"" the president said at the time, as Republicans accused him of turning his back on bipartisan solutions. Obama signed sweeping executive orders in 2014 that shielded millions of people living in the country illegally from facing deportation. ""If House Republicans are really concerned about me taking too many executive actions, the best solution to that is passing bills,"" he said then. ""Pass a bill. Solve a problem."" In June, a deadlocked Supreme Court ruling effectively killed one of those immigration orders, which shielded about 4 million people from deportation. Drones: ""We're getting too comfortable"" Obama also reflected in his NPR interview on the controversial decision to expand drone strikes in Pakistan, Yemen and the Horn of Africa. ""I'm the first one to admit that we didn't get it all right on Day 1,"" he said. ""There were times where, for example with respect to drones, that I had to kind of stop the system for a second, and say, 'You know what, we're getting too comfortable with our ability to take kinetic strikes around the world' without having enough process to avoid consistently the kinds of civilian casualties that can end up actually hurting us in the war against radicalization."" The administration acknowledged in July that drone strikes in countries where the U.S. has not been engaged in ground combat have killed up to 116 civilians since Obama took office. The president told NPR, in reference to drone strikes and surveillance by the National Security Agency, that he was confident his administration had built the ""guardrails"" needed to ""set up a whole series of processes to guard against government overreach, to reform some practices that I thought over time would threaten civil liberties."" Obama has issued an executive order instructing the director of national intelligence to release statistics on the use of drone strikes each year — another measure Donald Trump could overturn if he wants to.

npr,"December 19, 2016",5 Things You Should Know About The Electoral College," Electors from the 50 states will convene in their state capitols Monday and cast their votes for president. Republican Donald Trump is assured of a victory, unless there is a massive — and totally unexpected — defection by the electors who are pledged to support him. Here are five things you should know about the Electoral College: 1. How do you get to be an elector? The Constitution leaves it up to each state to select its electors, but ""there are two main ways,"" said George Edwards, a distinguished professor of political science at Texas A&amp;M; University: One is at state party conventions, when party members select a slate of electors, often party officials, almost always party insiders. That's how Jonathan Barnett was chosen. He's a Trump elector in Arkansas and was elected during his state party convention in August. Barnett believes that, as a former state representative and national GOP committeeman, he was chosen because of his ""dedication and loyalty to the party, and history with the party as a known factor."" That last point is important, because, he said, his phone has been ringing off the hook with people opposed to Trump, calling to plead with him to vote for someone else. ""Absolutely not"" going to happen, he said. The alternative to being selected at a state party convention is being chosen by the party's central committee or otherwise qualifying. Karen Packer, a Democratic elector in Oregon, was chosen automatically by virtue of her position as state party first vice chair. She said she is ""very honored"" to be an elector, even if in a losing cause. She said she has a certificate ""suitable for framing"" and signed by the Oregon secretary of state. Oregon's seven electors will cast their ballots in the state Senate chamber in Salem. 2. Are electors legally bound to vote for their party's nominee? Some states have passed laws to prevent so-called ""faithless electors"" from straying from their party's nominee. In other states, parties require electors to sign pledges of their loyalty. But Edwards isn't sure the state laws, which have not been challenged, would hold up in court. He believes they're unconstitutional, because, he said, ""the Constitution gives electors the right to exercise discretion."" In fact, he said, the founders expected electors to act independently, as there were no political parties at the time. He notes that electors were chosen by state legislatures until the 1830s. 3. Can anyone become an elector? Yes, except for federal officeholders, such as members of Congress or the executive branch. The states are required to submit ""Certificate(s) of Ascertainment"" listing their electors by Dec. 19 to the Office of the Federal Register, which administers the process. 4. So the electors meet in their state capitols Monday and cast their ballots for president. Then what? The states then submit a Certificate of Vote to the Federal Register, listing each person who received a vote for president and for vice president. There are to be six such certificates in each state, signed by each of that state's electors. Two of the certificates are then to be sent to Washington, with a copy to the vice president in his role as president of the Senate, and to the National archivist. (They have to be received in Washington by the president of the Senate and archivist by Dec. 28. See other key dates and processes here, from the National Archives and Records Administration.) On Jan. 6, the votes will be formally tallied before a Joint Session of Congress, and assuming someone gets a majority, or 270, electors, we'll officially know our next president. 5. This seems to be a pretty convoluted way of choosing a leader, isn't it? Edwards certainly believes so. ""It's a bizarre way of doing things,"" he said. There are efforts to change it, especially after this past election, which saw the winner of the popular vote lose the election for the second time in the past five elections. The National Popular Vote proposal would guarantee the winner of the popular vote is the winner of the presidency. It needs support from enough states to add up to 270 electoral votes. It has so far been enacted by 11 jurisdictions with 165 electoral votes. But it is unlikely to be adopted by a majority of states anytime soon.

npr,"December 19, 2016","To Rehabilitate Democratic Party, Obama Plans To 'Coach' Young Talent"," ""There are such incredible young people who not only worked on my campaign, but I've seen in advocacy groups,"" Obama said. ""I've seen passionate about issues like climate change, or conservation, criminal justice reform. You know, campaigns to — for a livable wage, or health insurance. And making sure that whatever resources, credibility, spotlight that I can bring to help them rise up. That's something that I think I can do well, I think Michelle can do well."" There are clearly, though, failures on our part to give people in rural areas or in ex-urban areas, a sense day-to-day that we're fighting for them or connected to them."" President Obama  The Democrats' deep hole They'll have their work cut out for them. Republicans will control the House, Senate and White House when President-elect Donald Trump is sworn in Jan. 20. That's a reversal of the situation Obama found himself in when he took office eight years ago — the peak of massive Democratic electoral gains at the end of the Bush administration. And on the state level, Republicans head into 2017 with 33 out of 50 governors — more than in nearly 100 years. The GOP will have complete control of the governors' offices and state legislatures in 25 states, while Democrats will hold complete control in just six states. Republicans solidified gains that started in 2010 by drawing favorable congressional and statehouse districts in many states during the redistricting process. Democrats find themselves in a deep hole after an election that most party officials expected to win. Obama told NPR that he disagreed with suggestions the party should change its policy platforms, instead attributing losses to messaging and strategy. ""I don't think there's something wrong with the core argument that the Democratic Party has made for years,"" the president said. ""And the reason we know that is because on the individual issues that Democrats talk about there's strong support. For example, the minimum wage. In every survey across the country, people support a higher minimum wage. There are clearly, though, failures on our part to give people in rural areas or in ex-urban areas, a sense day-to-day that we're fighting for them or connected to them."" The president said his party has ""ceded too much territory"" to Republicans in local races. ""I am a proud Democrat,"" he said, ""but I do think that we have a bias towards national issues and international issues."" It's the economy Obama blamed part of that on the political conversation, and what topics are magnified during campaigns. Voters, he said, ""may know less about the work that my administration did on trying to promote collective bargaining or overtime rules. But they know a lot about the controversy around transgender bathrooms. Because it's more controversial, it attracts more attention."" On strategy, Obama acknowledged that it was apparent soon after he entered the White House in 2009 that the successful campaign structure that got him elected to the presidency wasn't going to work for candidates down the ballot, but that the economic crash at the time meant the political spade work didn't receive enough attention. ""We were in a huge crisis situation, and so a lot of the organizing work that we did during the campaign, we started to see right away didn't immediately translate to, wasn't immediately transferable to congressional candidates,"" Obama said. ""More work would have needed to be done to just build up that structure."" Republicans made significant gains during midterm years when Obama's name was not on the ballot and his campaign wasn't in the field, taking control of the House in 2010 and the Senate in 2014. Competing for rural voters As he's done before, though, Obama also faulted Democrats for failing to compete — or even show up, at times — in rural areas. He talked about campaigning in rural Illinois while running for Senate and making repeated visits to Republican-friendly corners of Iowa during the 2008 campaign, ""and just sitting down in people's living rooms and VFW halls and at fish fries and listening to people."" ""Which meant that in 2012,"" the president continued, ""I might still lose the overall vote and some of these counties or some of these voting districts but I might lose 55-45 or 60-40, rather than 80-20."" They may know less about the work that my administration did on trying to promote collective bargaining or overtime rules. But they know a lot about the controversy around transgender bathrooms."" President Obama  Narrower losses in just a handful of rural counties could have put Hillary Clinton in the White House, as she lost Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan each by less than 1 percent. While Clinton has been criticized for not keeping up a busier campaign schedule, particularly in those industrial Midwestern states, she spent much of the early part of her campaign holding listening sessions with voters, and immediately following the Democratic National Convention, she went on a bus tour through the very parts of Ohio and Pennsylvania she has been criticized for not giving enough attention. Many of those conversations informed the issues and messages Clinton's campaign focused on, most notably opioid addiction and a plan to help people in coal country affected by job losses. But after that bus tour she didn't again put in a sustained effort to win over white, working class voters. Critical to the Democratic playbook in industrial states involves running up voting margins in urban areas. When turnout dropped in urban areas, but rose in rural counties, those key states flipped Republican for the first time in decades. Also in his conversation with NPR, Obama spoke of the need for Americans to pin their hopes for the country to more than who wins the White House every four years. ""If we either celebrate or despair just around presidential elections, without spending enough time focusing on how, in our day-to-day lives, in our local civic lives, in our media, in our culture,"" Obama said. ""If we're not spending enough time reflecting on, 'What am I doing to be part of the solution as opposed to being part of the problem?' Then we'll get better presidents and worse presidents, but we're not going to get to where we need to go."" NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor ",http://www.npr.org/505549311
npr,"December 19, 2016",Transcript And Video: NPR's Exit Interview With President Obama," Over my shoulder here is Theodore Roosevelt. In 1884, Theodore Roosevelt was frustrated about an election and wrote a letter saying the voice of the people might be the voice of God 51 times out of 100, but the other 49, it may be the voice of a devil or of a fool. Which do you think it was this time in 2016? Well, it's hard to assess because we know for example that Hillary won the popular vote by a sizable margin. We know that there are a substantial number of voters out there who not only voted for me twice but currently support me who also voted for Donald Trump. So I think we have a scrambled political landscape right now. There are some things that we know are a challenge for Democrats — structural problems. For example, population distribution, oftentimes younger voters, minority voters, Democratic voters, are clustered in urban areas. And on the coasts, sure. And on the coasts, and so as a consequence you've got a situation where there're not only entire states but also big chunks of states where, if we're not showing up, if we're not in there making an argument, then we're going to lose. And we can lose badly, and that's what happened in this election. Is this just a matter of showing up, or is there something wrong with the argument? Well. No, well, I don't think there's something wrong with the core argument that the Democratic Party has made for years. And the reason we know that is because on the individual issues that Democrats talk about there's strong support. For example, the minimum wage. In every survey across the country, people support a higher minimum wage. There are clearly, though, failures on our part to give people in rural areas or in exurban areas, a sense day-to-day that we're fighting for them or connected to them. Some of it is the prism through which they're seeing the political debate take place. They may know less about the work that my administration did on trying to promote collective bargaining or overtime rules. But they know a lot about the controversy around transgender bathrooms because it's more controversial, it attracts more attention. I think that on something like the Affordable Care Act, you have people who are benefiting right now from Obamacare who either don't know it's Obamacare or consider that as a given and then end up voting on Second Amendment rights. So part of the reason it's important to show up, and when I say show up, I don't just mean during election time, but to be in there engaging and listening and being with people, is because it then builds trust and it gives you a better sense of how should you talk about issues in a way that feel salient and feel meaningful to people. And I've said this before. Part of the reason I got elected twice — and part of the reason why in a lot of these communities I still have pretty strong support. It was the incredible benefit that I had in first running for the United States Senate in a state that has a lot of rural communities and has a downstate that typically is suspicious of Chicagoans in the city. And just sitting down in people's living rooms and VFW halls and at fish fries and listening to people. And then in Iowa, spending months traveling around the state and hearing people's concerns and them hearing me and getting a sense that I get it. So that even during my low points in the presidency, when, you know, poll numbers were bad and news cycle was critical, people always felt as if I still cared about them — which meant that in 2012, I might still lose the overall vote and some of these counties or some of these voting districts, but I might lose 55-45 or 60-40 rather than 80-20. That's as a consequence of not only them seeing me in these places but it's also a consequence of me actually being there and hearing them. Were Democrats failing to do that at every level because your party has lost the majority of races at almost every level at this point?  Well, you know, I think that we haven't done it as well as we need to. For example, we know that the Republicans, funded through organizations like the Koch brothers, have been very systematic at... Building from ground up. Building from the ground up and communicating to state legislators and financing school board races and public utility commission races, and, you know, I am a proud Democrat, but I do think that we have a bias towards national issues and international issues, and as a consequence I think we've ceded too much territory. And I take some responsibility for that. You know, when I came into office, um, you know, we were just putting out fires. We were in a huge crisis situation. And so a lot of the organizing work that we did during the campaign, we started to see right away didn't immediately translate to, wasn't immediately transferable to, congressional candidates. And more work would have needed to be done to just build up that structure and, you know, one of the big suggestions that I have for Democrats as I leave, and something that, you know, I have some ideas about is, how do we do more of that ground up building? Do you intend to be involved or just give advice? Well, I think it's appropriate for me to give advice because I need some sleep. And I've promised Michelle a nice vacation. My girls are getting old enough now where I'm clinging to those very last moments before they are out of the house. But there was a political organization that was built around you that still exists. Well, I'm less likely to get involved in all the nuts and bolts of electioneering. In that realm, I'm much more likely to just give advice. What I am interested in is just developing a whole new generation of talent. There are such incredible young people who not only worked on my campaign, but I've seen in advocacy groups. I've seen passionate about issues like climate change or conservation, criminal justice reform, you know, campaigns for a livable wage, or health insurance, and making sure that whatever resources, credibility, spotlight that I can bring to help them rise up. That's something that I think I can do well, I think Michelle can do well. That's part of what makes me optimistic about our future because I know those young people are out there ready to lead, and when they start moving into more and more positions of authority, then I think the issues that I care most deeply about are going to be well served. You want to be a talent scout and build the bench that Democrats have admitted they don't have. Well, not only a talent scout but I think also, you know, a coach, a friend, somebody who can build on the incredible work that has already been done by young people and that to a large degree was responsible for getting me elected. Did the Russian hack of the Democratic National Committee — and other targets — actually affect the results of the election in your view? There's no doubt that it contributed to an atmosphere in which the only focus for weeks at a time, months at a time, were Hillary's e-mails, the Clinton Foundation, political gossip surrounding the DNC. And that whole swirl that ended up dominating the news meant that number one, issues weren't talked about a lot in the coverage. Huge policy differences were not debated and vetted. It also meant that, what I think would have been a big advantage for Hillary objectively, her experience, her knowledge, her outstanding reputation around the world as secretary of state, all that stuff got lost. And I think in that scrum, in that swirl, you know, Donald Trump and his celebrity and his ability to garner attention and obviously tap into a lot of the anxieties and fears that some voters have, I think, definitely made a difference. Now know how you would, this ... Could you say the election could have turned out differently? That's what I want to know.  Well, elections can always turn out differently. You never know which factors are gonna make a difference. But I have no doubt that it had some impact just based on the coverage. And by the way, I'm talking about mainstream news coverage. I'm not talking about a whole separate set of issues around fake news. I'm talking about what was in the New York Times and the Washington Post and on the nightly news and even on NPR. And it meant that the field where I think Hillary shone, the field of substance and talking about how we're actually gonna increase people's wages and how we're gonna provide health care coverage to people and how we're gonna deal with major issues like climate change — that wasn't the field in which the campaign was ultimately decided. Was that the media's fault for focusing on the wrong things or the candidate's fault for not finding ways to get her message through?  Steve, you know, I'd say that Monday morning quarterbacking is always easy to do. And what I've said already publicly, and I'll repeat: There is something about our current political ecosystem — and we're all part of it, the parties, the candidates, the media, the voters — that leads us to avoid going deep into the issues that are really gonna affect people's day-to-day lives, that put a premium on what here in the White House we call the shiny object: the faux scandals, the trumped up controversies, the, um, you know, insults that are flung back and forth. So that it ends up being covered like a reality show or — at best, a sporting event. And we lose track of the fact that this has an impact on some family that's trying to send their kids to college, or some veteran who's trying to get their benefits, or whether or not some of our young people get sent to a far away land to fight a war. And if we don't, you know, do some hard reflection — all of us — on how that happens, then we're like a body that is already weakened and then becomes more vulnerable to foreign viruses, becomes more vulnerable to manipulation and demagoguery and that's something that I'm also going to be thinking a lot about in my afterlife, my post-presidency. You talked about this with the comedian Trevor Noah the other day. And you said a number of things in a row. You observed that there had been contacts between members of Mr. Trump's staff and Russian officials. You noted that Trump benefited from the hacks. Your spokesman, Josh Earnest, has gone on to say this week that it's obvious that Trump knew what was going on. To what extent are you suggesting some kind of cooperation between the president-elect and Russian officials here? Well, I'm, I'm not suggesting cooperation at all. Keep in mind that those statements were in the context of everyone now acting surprised by the CIA assessment that this was done purposely to improve Trump's chances. And my only point was that shouldn't be treated as a blockbuster because that was the worst kept secret in this town. Everybody understood that. It was reported on. Steve, if you go back and look at your stories, if you read any mainstream publication, you would see that if you have a hack of the DNC and a hack of Hillary Clinton's most senior advisers' e-mails, and those things are then released in drip-drip-drip fashion over the course of months, and that seem to generate consistently negative coverage despite the fact that there's nothing in there that's particularly controversial, that it's mostly just, as I said, political gossip or routine emails between folks who are working in a campaign environment, then it's a pretty clear inference that people would draw, and did draw, that this was helping the Trump campaign and it was hurting the Hillary campaign. That doesn't mean that the Trump campaign was coordinating. It just means that they understood what everybody else understood, which was that this was not good for Hillary Clinton's campaign. And when you combine that with the fact that the president-elect has been very honest about his admiration for Putin and that he hopes to forge a more cooperative relationship with him and focus on the threat of Islamic terrorism, then my only point was we shouldn't now suddenly act as if this is a huge revelation. In October, we said, after being very careful about it because we had no interest in appearing as if we were putting our thumbs on the scales, we did what was almost unprecedented which was, every intelligence agency in the federal government arrived at a consensus, that the Russians had hacked the DNC. And the information that was now being released was as a consequence of a decision by Russian intelligence and Russian officials at the highest levels. So what the CIA is now assessing, which was it was done purposefully to tilt the election in the direction of a particular candidate, shouldn't be a surprise to anybody. And in fact isn't a surprise to anybody. And as I said before, the issue now is not relitigating the election. The issue now is for us to learn lessons so that we don't have an ongoing situation in every election cycle where you have substantial foreign influence in our campaigns. There's another issue going forward. Is it necessary for the security of the United States that Russia pay some price for doing this ...? I think there is no doubt that when any foreign government tries to impact the integrity of our elections that we need to take action and we will, at a time and place of our own choosing. Some of it may be explicit and publicized; some of it may not be. But Mr. Putin is well aware of my feelings about this, because I spoke to him directly about it. And there is, you know, among the big powers, there has been a traditional understanding of that everybody is trying to gather intelligence on everybody else. It's no secret that Russian intelligence officers, or Chinese, or for that matter Israeli, or British, or other intelligence agencies, that their job is to get insight into the workings of other countries that they they're not reading in the newspapers every day. There's a difference between that and the kind of malicious cyberattacks that steal trade secrets or engage in industrial espionage, something that we've seen the Chinese do. And there's a difference between that and activating intelligence, in a way that's designed to influence elections. So we have been working hard to make sure that what we do is proportional. That what we do is meaningful. One of the things that we're going to have to do over the next decade is to ultimately arrive at some rules of what is a new game. And that is the way in which traditional propaganda and traditional covert influence efforts are being turbocharged by the Internet and by the cyber world. And so the whole issue of cybersecurity and how we play defense, how we think about offense and how we avoid an escalation of a major cyber war, or a cyber arms race, is something that some of our smartest folks in government and in the private sector are spending a lot of time thinking about. Because there is an asymmetry here. We are more digitalized. Our economy is more advanced. It's much wealthier. And it means that we have certain vulnerabilities that some of our adversaries don't have. And this is actually a good example of where, in addition to whatever actions that we take bilaterally against Russia, we've got to spend some time working at an international level to start instituting some norms, the same way we did with things like nuclear weapons because ultimately we can have a situation where everybody's worse off. That's what we did with China when we were seeing repeated hacking primarily for industrial espionage purposes, commercial purposes. They were stealing, you know, technology and ideas. And I had a very blunt conversation and President Xi saying ""If you don't stop it, here's what we are going to do."" But what we also did was we mobilized the G-20, and the G7, and the United Nations, to start adopting basic rules saying ""this is not something you do."" And that can make a difference over time. If whatever response you take is not completed by January 20th, do you have any reason to have confidence that President Trump will continue it? My view is that this is not a partisan issue. And part of what we should be doing is to try to take it out of election season and move it into governing season. The irony of all this, of course, is that for most of my presidency there's been a pretty sizable wing of the Republican Party that has consistently criticized me for not being tough enough on Russia. Some of those folks during the campaign endorsed Donald Trump despite the fact that a central tenant of his foreign policy was we shouldn't be so tough on Russia. And that kind of inconsistency, I think, makes it appear at least, that their particular position on Russia on any given day depends on what's politically expedient. There was a poll that came out a couple of days ago that said that 37 percent of Republicans have a favorable view of Vladimir Putin. Think about that. Over a third of Republican voters think Putin is a good guy. This is somebody who — the former head of the KGB, who is responsible for crushing democracy in Russia, muzzling the press, throwing political dissidents in jail, countering American efforts to expand freedom at every turn — is currently making decisions that's leading to a slaughter in Syria. And a big chunk of the Republican Party, which prided itself during the Reagan era and for decades that followed as being the bulwark against Russian influence, now suddenly is embracing him. And my point here is that it's very important that we do not let the inner family argument between Americans, the domestic political differences between Democrats and Republicans, obscure the need for us to stand together, figure out what it is that the Russians are interested in doing in terms of influencing our democratic process and inoculating ourselves from it. And that requires us having a clear-eyed view about it. It requires us not to relitigate the election. It requires us not to point fingers. It requires us to just say ""Here's what happened, let's be honest about it and let's not use it as a political football, but let's figure out how we prevent this from happening in the future."" Because it's not just going to be Russia. It sounds like you hope any response would continue after January 20. But do you have any reason to know that it would? Well, you know, I can't ... It's up to him.  ... look into my crystal ball and, that's probably a question better directed at the president-elect. I can say that I've had a conversation with the president-elect about our foreign policy generally, and the importance of us making sure that, in how we approach intelligence gathering, in how we think about fighting terrorism and keeping the country secure, in how we think about, you know, our relationship to multilateral organizations, that, you know, we recognize America's exceptionalism, our indispensability in the world, in part draws from our values and our ideals and the fact that even our adversaries generally respect our adherence to rule of law, our transparency, our openness. And if we start losing that, if other countries start seeing that ""Oh, America doesn't care about these issues"" or it's just a ""might makes right"" environment, and we're not speaking out on behalf of our values and demonstrating our values, then America is going to be significantly weakened. Should President-elect Trump, once he's inaugurated, use his executive powers in the same way that you have? I think that he is entirely within his lawful power to do so. Keep in mind though that my strong preference has always been to legislate when I can get legislation done. In my first two years, I wasn't relying on executive powers, because I had big majorities in the Congress and we were able to get bills done, get bills passed. And even after we lost the majorities in Congress, I bent over backwards consistently to try to find compromise and a legislative solution to some of the big problems that we've got — a classic example being immigration reform, where I held off for years in taking some of the executive actions that I ultimately took in pursuit of a bipartisan solution — one that, by the way, did pass through the Senate on a bipartisan basis with our help. I was very proud of that. I went out of my way to make sure our help was behind the scenes so that Republicans didn't feel as if it was going to hurt them politically. At the end of the day, John Boehner and the House Republicans couldn't pull the trigger on getting it done. And it was only then, after we had exhausted efforts for bipartisan reform that we took some additional steps on immigration executive actions. So my suggestion to the president-elect is, you know, going through the legislative process is always better, in part because it's harder to undo. And that doesn't mean, though, that he is not going to come in and look at the various agencies and see the rules we've passed and if he wants to reverse some of those rules, that's part of the democratic process. That's, you know, why I tell people to vote because it turns out elections mean something. And this election means even more because the presidency, as has been widely noted, is so powerful. It's grown more powerful over generations. You used your power in certain ways, and even in ways that you'd suggested in the past might be beyond your authority.  Well, no, I don't think I've done that. If I'm thinking of immigration, for example.  Well, what I said with immigration reform was that I couldn't simply sign a document that legalized 11 million people who had come here illegally and were currently undocumented. What I could do is find categories of people where we could not prioritize as significant risks. But what I always said was we couldn't solve the basic problem of these folks being in the shadows without legislation. Let's stipulate that you feel that what you did was clearly within the law. The question for me is has the presidency become too powerful in your view? I distinguish between domestic policy and foreign policy. I think on foreign policy, the concern I have right now is because we're in a nontraditional war. It's what we call the war on terrorism, although terrorism to some degree is a tactic. We're in a war against a non-state, a set of non-state actors that are operating in the shadows, are in nooks and crannies and crevices around the world. And what that means is that you're never going to have a scene of surrender like we had with the Emperor [Hirohito] and Gen. MacArthur, where you don't have a clear start and finish to the use of force. The danger is that over time, Congress starts feeling pretty comfortable with just having the president do all this stuff and not really having to weigh in. So for example, we're still operating in our fight against ISIL without a new congressional authorization. It's the authorization that dates back to 9/11. And I think that is an area that we have to worry about. The president and the executive branch are always going to have greater latitude and greater authority when it comes to protecting America, because sometimes you just have to respond quickly and not everything that is a danger can be publicized and be subject to open debate. But there have to be some guardrails. And what we've had to do on things like drones, or the NSA, or a number of the tools that we use to penetrate terrorist networks, what we've had to do is to build the guard rails internally. Essentially set up a whole series of processes to guard against government overreach, to reform some practices that I thought over time would threaten civil liberties. You know, there are some critics on the left who would argue we haven't gone far enough on that. I would argue that we've gotten it about right, although I'm the first one to admit that we didn't get it all right on day one. There were times where, for example, with respect to drones, that I had to kind of stop the system for a second, and say ""You know what? We're getting too comfortable with our ability to take kinetic strikes around the world without having enough process to avoid consistently the kinds of civilian casualties that can end up actually hurting us in the war against radicalization."" On the domestic side, the truth is that, you know, there hasn't been a radical change between what I did and what George Bush did and what Bill Clinton did and what the first George Bush did. It's, you know, the issue of big agencies, like the Environmental Protection Agency or the Department of Labor, having to take laws that have been passed, like the Clean Air Act, which is hugely complicated and very technical, and fill in the gaps and figure out our ""What does this mean and how do we apply this to new circumstances?"" That's not new. Having federal bureaucracies and federal regulations, that's not new. I think that what's happened that I do worry about is that Congress has become so dysfunctional, that more and more of a burden is placed on the agencies to fill in the gaps, and the gaps get bigger and bigger because they're not constantly refreshed and tweaked. Let's go back to something like the Affordable Care Act. I could not be prouder of the fact that the uninsured rate has never been lower. That 20 million people have health insurance that we didn't have before. But I said when the bill passed that it wasn't perfect. Over the course of six years of implementing a very complicated piece of legislation that affects one-sixth of the economy, that there were going to be things we learned that would allow us to improve it. And I don't know how many times I've said to Republicans, both publicly and privately, in State of the Union speeches, in town halls around the country, that if they're willing to engage and work with me, then we can identify ways to tweak and improve this system so that more people have health insurance and it works even better and it's more stable, and build on the things that seemed to have worked. For example, the fact that we've actually slowed the growth of health care costs since the bill passed. And each time I've said this, the basic Republican response has been ""No, all we want to do is repeal it. And we'll replace it with something later."" And they're still saying that now post-election, although as we've seen, the best independent estimates are if you just repeal and you don't replace you're going to have 30 million people without health insurance, not to mention people who already have health insurance suddenly losing a lot of the benefits that individually are very popular though people don't know that they're part of Obamacare, like making sure that you don't get barred from getting insurance if you have a pre-existing condition, or keeping your kid on your health care until they're 26 years old. So the fierce partisanship, the unwillingness to engage in amending laws, fixing laws. That then leads to agencies having to scramble to do more work. And the bottom line is, if you want to right-size executive power relative to the other branches of government, the best way to do that is to have a healthy Congress in which the two parties are debating, disagreeing but also occasionally working together to pass legislation. Couple of other things Mr. President: Is President-elect Trump right that political correctness in this country has gone too far? We've discussed campus debates here... Yeah, we have. We have, and this is a tricky issue and here's why: Because the definition of political correctness is all over the map. And I suspect the president-elect's definition of political correctness would be different than mine. If what's meant by political correctness is that there is some broad disapproval that's expressed when somebody uses a racial epithet, or somebody makes a derogatory comment about women, or about the LGBT community, and people say, ""Hey, you shouldn't do that. That's wrong, that's cruel, that's hurtful. Here's the history of that word."" And when you use words like that, you're reinforcing people feeling like they're outsiders, and less than other Americans. I don't consider that political correctness. I consider that good manners, sound values and hard-fought gains in the nature of American society and American community. I think it's a good thing that we don't think that using the ""n"" word is socially acceptable. I think it's a good thing that we don't refer to women in derogatory ways — because I have a couple of daughters, and I don't want them to feel that way. Now, if you're narrowly defining political correctness as a hypersensitivity that ends up resulting in people not being able to express their opinions at all without somebody suggesting they're a victim, you know, if sort of, our social discourse and our political discourse becomes like walking on eggshells so that if somebody says ""You know what, I'm not sure affirmative action is the right way to solve racial problems in this country,"" and somebody's immediately accused of being racist, well, then I think you have a point. Although I happen to approve of affirmative action, but I think that I can have a polite dialogue with somebody who differs from me on that issue. And so, on the one hand, my advice to progressives like myself, and this is advice I give my own daughters who are about to head off to college, is don't go around just looking for insults. You're tough. If somebody says something you don't agree with, just engage them on their ideas. But you don't have to feel that somehow because you're a black woman that you're being assaulted. But speak up for yourself, and if you hear somebody saying something that's insulting, feel free to say to that guy, ""You know what? You're rude"" or ""you're ignorant"" and take them on. But the thing that I want to emphasize here though is, the irony in this debate is often-times you'll hear somebody like a Rush Limbaugh, or other conservative commentators, or you know, radio shock jocks, or some conservative politicians, who are very quick to jump on any evidence of progressives being ""politically correct,"" but who are constantly aggrieved and hypersensitive about the things they care about, and are continually feeding this sense of victimization, and that they are being subject to reverse discrimination. Look, I had to live through controversies like the notion that I was trying to kill Christmas. Right? Well, where'd that come from? Well, you know, ""He said 'Happy Holidays' instead of 'Merry Christmas,' so that must be evidence of him either not being a Christian or not caring about Christmas."" It sounds funny now, but you'll have entire debates in conservative circles around that. So it cuts both ways. And my advice to young people, and my advice to all of us as citizens, is to be able to distinguish between being courteous and being thoughtful and thinking about how words affect other people and not demonizing others versus having legitimate political debates and disagreements. This raises one other question though, Mr. President. We've talked with a lot of voters, and it's clear that for many people this has been an agonizing year, an agonizing political year, even for people whose side won. Is it possible, though, that that agony has been good for the country because we are confronting issues of race and identity and the way the economy is structured, issues that have been with us for a long time? I think that's a really interesting point. I've been accused by friends, enemies, my wife, of sometimes being overly optimistic. But what can I tell you, this is this is my temperament generally. And we are going through some growing pains right now, because the world is changing really fast, and it has throughout my presidency. I started my presidency inheriting a massive crisis of proportions that we haven't seen since the 1930s. It laid bare some long-term and troubling trends about globalization, and technology, and rising inequality, and the fragility of our financial systems, and the way in which middle-class folks felt they were getting squeezed. And the fact that the ladders of opportunity seem to be farther and fewer between for people who are trying to get out of poverty. And throughout that process, we also then started seeing — because when the economy's not doing well some other tensions get laid bare — changing attitudes about sexual orientation, and about race, and about the nature of families. And all of this has been amped up by the revolution in information, throwing through social media and the Internet. And so it's a big dose. It's been a lot of stuff that's been coming at people really quickly, and it's made folks anxious. But I do think that part of the reason for these tensions is because we've been starting to wrestle with some things that ultimately are solvable if we make some good decisions. The economy right now is stable. And so we have some time to say to ourselves, even though it's stable right now, the trend lines are such where more and more jobs are going to be digitalized, more and more jobs are going to be robotized. What are we going to do to make sure that as more workers are moving out of manufacturing into the service sector, that they are getting a decent wage? How are we going to create more jobs once self-driving cars eliminate a bunch of well-paying jobs of just driving and moving stuff around? How do we rebuild our infrastructure and rebuild our education system? We can solve these things, but it's going to be challenging. And we've got to have an honest debate about it. With respect to how we deal with each other, the demographics of the country are going to change. It's inevitable. The Latino community in America is going to grow. If you stopped all immigration today, just by virtue of birth rates, this is going to be a browner country. And if we're not thinking right now about how we make sure that next generation is getting a good education and are instilled with a common creed and the values that make America so special and are cared for and nurtured and loved the way every American child is treated, then we're not going to be as successful. But the good news is we've got time to do it. With respect to race and the relationship between the African-American community and police, all these smartphones suddenly taking pictures are not documenting a suddenly worsening relationship between the African-American community and the police. They are recording what has been a long-standing tension and the sense on the part of police that they're put in a very difficult situation of trying to manage law enforcement in poor communities where guns are easily accessible, the African-American community being rightly convinced that there is a long history of racial bias in our criminal justice system. And as painful as it is, that conversation is long overdue. So, my feeling is that if everybody takes a breath, and if we can structure a conversation that is less about ""how somebody else is trying to take advantage of me,"" and structure the conversation around ""how can we work together to solve problems that makes everybody better off?"" that America can emerge stronger. But that requires leadership. It requires citizenship. It requires all of us doing self-reflection at the same time as we're fighting on behalf of the things that we care deeply about. And I speak as a progressive Democrat who is really, really proud of the work we've done. I can say, and I can demonstrate, I can document that the country is a lot better off now than it was when I took office in almost every dimension. But what I can also say is that we could be doing even better. There are times where I reflect and ask myself if, ""Is there's something else I could have done, something that I could have said slightly differently that would have led to additional progress and less polarization?"" And I'll probably, you know, as I reflect on my presidency, once I'm out of just the day-to-day scrum of this thing, I'm sure I'll come up with a whole bunch of things to add to my list. But I think all of us have to do that. You know, I've said this before: This is advanced democracy, what the founders set up. And, you know, if we either celebrate or despair just around presidential elections, without spending enough time focusing on how, in our day-to-day lives, in our local civic lives, in our media, in our culture, if we're not spending enough time reflecting on, ""What am I doing to be part of the solution as opposed to being part of the problem?"" Then we'll get better presidents and worse presidents, but we're not going to get to where we need to go. If you'll forgive a final question: I know you get letters and that your staff gives you a few letters to read each day. What have the letters been like since the election?  Well, there's, for not just Democrats, but also for a number of young people, I think that there's been concern, fear, in some cases. The letters that worry me most are letters from either teachers or students themselves, where they say, ""I'm in a majority Latino school, and I'm teaching third graders, and a child will go up to a teacher and say, 'Why don't people like me?' "" Or a Muslim college student who starts thinking that there's no place for her in this country that she loves. Those are the most worrisome and those are ones where I respond and say that you have to have faith in the basic goodness of this country and that it outweighs the bad. You've been writing back?  Yeah, I generally write back as many of the 10 letters I get a night. Now to be fair, because, you know, I try to make sure that I'm not just getting letters from supporters. There's been some letters that say, ""I am so glad you're getting out of here. Good riddance. You've been a horrible president."" And uh, ... You write them back, too? And ""America's great again."" Sometimes I do. The most interesting letters I get, because they're unexpected, and I'm talking about since the election, have been people who've written and said, ""I didn't vote for you, but I want you to know that I appreciate the manner in which you've conducted yourself in office. And I think that you've been a good dad."" In some cases they said, ""In retrospect I think you did a pretty good job."" Those letters, in some ways, mean the most to me because you're persuading skeptics. But even if you haven't persuaded them on the issues, at least maybe they've recognized that I've tried to be true to the meaning of this office, that I've held it in reverence. But it's worth mentioning that pre-election, a lot of letters I get, a lot of the letters I get that are most meaningful are really simple. It might be a senior citizen who is complaining about not having gotten a cost of living adjustment on Social Security and will just list out their budget for the month, and giving you sort of a vivid picture of how hard it is to get by. It might be a kid after a shooting like Newtown saying ""I'm scared."" And sometimes it's just a family that's writing to say, ""You know what? We have concerns, and things are tough, but, you know what, we're resilient and we love each other and we think we're going to make it, and we hope you stay at it, and we hope you're hearing us."" Mr. President, thanks for these conversations. I've appreciated them very much and I know many of our listeners have as well. I appreciate it very much. After the conversation, Obama returned to the room to say one more thing about the CIA. You had something you wanted to add. When we're discussing the issue of the Russia hack, I think it is worth noting that when it comes to the motivations of the Russians, that there are still a whole range of assessments taking place among the agencies. And so when I receive a final report, you know, we'll be able to I think give us a comprehensive and best guess as to those motivations. But that does not in any way I think detract from the basic point that everyone during the election perceived accurately that in fact what the Russian hack had done was create more problems for the Clinton administra — the Clinton campaign than it had for the Trump campaign. I think you're stopping short of endorsing the CIA conclusion that the hack was designed to help Donald Trump as opposed to some other objective. Well I think the point I'm making is that right now what you've had are CIA leaks, not of an official document. And I think it's important for the process of various agencies comparing notes and thinking about these assessments. Because it's not as if in any of these circumstances, you know you just have a signed letter regarding Russian intentions that's floating around. These are all assessments made based on a wide range of evidence and different agencies are still looking at all that stuff gathering it together and hopefully putting into a single package. That's precisely why I've asked that report to be issued before the 20th so that those aspects of at least that are not classified can be presented in some form to the public. Those aspects of it that are classified can be presented as we've consistently done on a bipartisan basis to the members of Congress and the relevant committees.

npr,"December 18, 2016",How One Couple Fought For The Legal Right To Leave A Bad Yelp Review," The order, from the online retailer KlearGear, never arrived. After a testy back and forth with the company's customer service, Jen Palmer did what many thousands of consumers do every month: She posted about her negative experience on an online business review site. ""I posted the review and then we forgot about it,"" she says. But four years later, they received an email from the company demanding they take the review down. The company said they had violated a ""non-disparagement"" clause in the terms of service — a caveat in the fine print that restricts customers from publicly reviewing their experience with the company. The company said the Palmers would be subject to a $3,500 fine if they didn't comply. The Palmers refused to take down the review or pay the fine. A few months later the couple found their credit had taken a major hit — KlearGear had passed the fine on to a collection agency and reported it to several credit bureaus as an unpaid bill. They went to the press and found legal representation from Public Citizen, a consumer rights advocacy group. ""The purpose of a non-disparagement clause is to have a hammer with which to hit consumers who haven't said anything false,"" says Paul Levy, a lawyer with Public Citizen. ""But you can make them take it down, and you can seek damages, you can seek attorney's fees, what might you."" Levy says gag clauses like these can limit truthful speech and deprive consumers of valuable information when choosing where to spend their money. After a lengthy legal back and forth, the Palmers won a default judgment in federal court and their credit was restored. But their case was an extreme example. ""Surely 95 percent of the time consumers simply remove the review, rather than stand behind their words, in order to avoid any potential legal action,"" says Eric Goldman, a law professor at Santa Clara University School of Law. He says it's likely that the use of these gag clauses is much more widespread than it appears. ""So the number of lawsuits are fairly rare because there's a much larger group of reviews that have been removed under the threat of lawsuits,"" Goldman says. The KlearGear case attracted media coverage around the country and helped gain the attention of legislators. California passed a law outlawing the use of non-disparagement clauses to limit customer reviews in 2014. Online review platforms like Yelp and TripAdvisor joined the effort to pass federal legislation. It culminated last week, when President Obama signed the Consumer Review Fairness Act into law after it passed unanimously in the Senate last month. It prohibits businesses from putting non-disparagement clauses into terms of service. Those clauses ""will not work in court. And they will expose the business that tries to use those techniques to potential liability,"" Goldman explains. He points out that under the law, businesses will still have the ability to combat false reviews through defamation law. Not everyone is happy about the new law, however. Joe Sullivan, an Atlanta business attorney who regularly advises businesses on how to deal with negative online reviews, says he's heard some pushback from businesses, none of whom wanted to speak on the record. ""It wasn't necessarily a solution in search of a problem,"" he says, ""but it was something where it wasn't a widespread practice."" Sullivan says there wasn't much incentive for companies to use this kind of fine print to sue customers. He says some businesses view the law as an effort by consumer review sites to grow their customer base. Despite the concerns of some businesses, Jen Palmer is happy that the new law means customers like her will not face legal retaliation in the future. ""I'm very glad to hear that this seems to be the one thing that Congress can agree on,"" she says. ""I'd definitely call it the best Christmas present of all, to make sure that nobody else has to go through this.""

npr,"December 18, 2016",Radio Host Charlie Sykes On Being A 'Contrarian Conservative' In The Age Of Trump," CHARLIE SYKES: It's my pleasure. MARTIN: Remind us again of what it is that you found and continue to find objectionable about Donald Trump, particularly from a conservative perspective. SYKES: Well, I would break this into two parts. Number one - during the primary, you know, I recently made the case that I did not believe that he was a conservative. I believe that basically he's a man without any principle whatsoever who had adopted certain positions because he thought that this was necessary to seal the deal. But, fundamentally, my objection to Donald Trump was as the man, as somebody that I thought was fundamentally unfit to be president, you know, as somebody who was narcissistic, bombastic, vindictive, not terribly interested in learning his serial cruelty to other people, the way that he became really, I thought, a caricature of what a lot of people had said conservatives would say about minorities or foreigners or women. MARTIN: One of the points that you made throughout the campaign writing in both kind of local Wisconsin media and also in national media is that you thought that the Wisconsin approach was really focused on, you know, policy. You said that in The New York Times, for example, that even focusing on policy led to this kind of a backlash, for example, that Twitter trolls sent you pictures with your face photoshopped into a gas chamber. Are you shocked by that? I mean, were you prepared for that? SYKES: Any time you do, you know, a show like I do, you have to have a thick skin, and you realize that politics has been very divisive for some time here. This didn't just happen this year. But having said that, yeah, I had never seen anything like the level of vitriol that was experienced. There would be nights when I would appear on a cable show and open up my Twitter feed, and there would be 500, 600, 700 reactions. And to say that, you know, many of them were intense is putting it mildly. The level of blowback, I think, that people got, the level of anger was something not totally unprecedented, but it's just I think in tone and volume was something that I had never seen before. MARTIN: This is where you say you fault the right that, you know, part of the problem here is that the politics have become so binary. It's either you're right or you're wrong, and it's not just that you're wrong, you're evil. And you say that this is in part because conservatives didn't hold up their end. You said for years we ignored the birthers, the racists, the truthers and other conspiracy theorists. So do you feel you, perhaps, share some responsibility for that? SYKES: Yes. I did participate in that. And, yes, I do bear some responsibility. And I think that this is one of those moments where I think everybody who has been part of American politics and journalism needs to step back and look in the mirror and ask that question. OK, did I feed this monster? How did we get to this point where we did it? Now, obviously... MARTIN: Well, stop just one second though. Give me an example of where you think you participated in it. SYKES: I think it was more of the sins of omission where, you know, I knew that there were these conspiracy theories in the crackpot (unintelligible). You know, and I would try to send back emails saying, you know, this is not true. This is not true. You know, but did I go out strongly enough and say draw this line? Or was I one of those who figured, OK, you know, whatever, it's the crazy uncle at Thanksgiving, and we'll just, you know, give him another gin and tonic and ignore him? And also I talk about the criticism of the mainstream media, which, by the way, much of it is justifiable. I mean - and I hope the people in the mainstream media as well engage in some introspection - but our criticism had gone on so long and so intensively that we had succeeded, I think, in de-legitimizing all of those media voices. So one day, I wake up, and I'm pushing back on some bogus story. And I say, well, look, it's been debunked in this fact check here on The Washington Post or The New York Times or NPR. And the response I will get - well, those are just liberal outlets. And we'd gotten to the point where if it was not from the bubble, if it was not from within our alternative reality silo, people were just not going to pay attention to it. They were not going to do it. MARTIN: If you had to do it over again, what would you do differently? SYKES: I think, in part, it would be to - in the 1990s, I encouraged more dialogue, more debate. And as things became more intense, I think I let that slide. One of the things that's happened in America is - you mentioned - is the - is this binary politics. And it's the increased tribalization - our tribe versus your tribe. And since they never talk with one another, it's very easy to demonize the other person. But the reality is that that becomes very, very easy then to become more extreme, more polarized. Whatever your guy does, whatever lies he tells, whatever gaffe he commits, you are going to overlook because, well, at least he's not that other person. He's not Hillary. He's not that other tribe because the other tribe is always, always worse. MARTIN: Does this change your sense of yourself of what it means to be a conservative? SYKES: You know, it does in this respect. I'm still a conservative, you know, someone who believes in limited government and balanced budgets and the Constitution. But I don't feel that I'm going to be part of a movement anymore. So if I'm a conservative, I will be a contrarian conservative, but certainly not a team player. MARTIN: Well, you say that that isn't why you're leaving, though. With everything being said, that's not why you're leaving your talk show - that your reasons are personal. Do you mind if we ask even though it is personal what are your reasons? SYKES: No. Well, no, I don't mind that at all. My father who I was very, very close with passed away. He died at the age of 63. And this year, I turned 62. And so I have always circled this date because, you know, if I was going to make a change, I was going to make a change then. And, you know, even though I've been doing a radio show for a quarter of a century, I'm still really at heart a print guy. And I want to go back to writing. I want to - I don't want to have to get up every morning and have an opinion on everything in the world. I think it will be an incredible luxury to step back and actually think about things before I have to opine and express an opinion. But I feel like I've done this long enough, and the example of my father who underlies the fact that we are all mortal and that we don't - we can't take for granted that we're going to be able to do this forever. MARTIN: Well, good luck. SYKES: Thank you. I think we'll all need it. MARTIN: That's Charlie Sykes speaking to us from Milwaukee. Charlie Sykes, thanks so much for speaking with us. SYKES: Thank you so much. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

npr,"December 18, 2016",U.S. Kids Now Less Likely To Earn More Than Their Parents," Lead economist on this report is Raj Chetty. He's the founder of the Equality of Opportunity Project. That's a research group that focuses on economic mobility. He's also a professor of economics at Stanford University, and that's where we reached him. We began by talking about his research, which looked at baby boomers. RAJ CHETTY: If you look at kids born in the 1940s, in the 1950s and compare their incomes at age 30 to what their parents were earning at age 30, adjusting for inflation, you find that 90 percent of them were earning more than their parents. But when you look at kids born in the 1980s, kids turning 30 today, that number has dropped to 50 percent. It's basically a coin flip as to whether you will do better than your parents for the current generation. MARTIN: What caused this? CHETTY: One is declining economic growth. So GDP growth is now lower than it was in prior decades. And so think of that as the economic pie is now growing more slowly than it did in the past. The second major trend that's occurred is that we have more inequality, so more of the growth that is occurring is going to a handful of people at the very top of the income distribution. So we ask, how much did these two trends contribute to the decline in upward mobility? And what we find is that the vast majority of the reduction is because of growing inequality rather than reduced growth rates. If all of the growth is going to, say, a single person, then of course it's going to be very difficult for a large fraction of kids to do better than their parents. That is, it's really about how the pie is divided rather than the total size of the pie. MARTIN: Are there particular people whose share of the slice of the pie, as it were, has gotten smaller? CHETTY: Yes. So the middle class is now getting a much smaller slice of the pie of economic growth. So if GDP has basically doubled from 1980 to today, on average, American incomes have gone up by a factor of two since 1980. Yet for - most Americans didn't see any of that gain at all. MARTIN: What do we know about the other half of kids who are doing better than their parents? CHETTY: These are kids who, you know, were very talented and did extremely well based on their own abilities and ambitions. But also, I suspect many of them had the opportunity to go to great schools, live in excellent neighborhoods, have mentors who really helped them succeed, had access to great job opportunities, internships, colleges. There's still a large fraction of kids who luckily have those opportunities. The question is how we can extend those opportunities to the remaining 50 percent of American kids. MARTIN: I think the question for a lot of people would be would similarly situated people living in different places have different results? For example, is some of this not just individual, but is it also geographic? CHETTY: Absolutely. And when we look at the subset of people who do choose to move to different areas, we find that some parts of the country - for example, Salt Lake City, Utah or parts of the West Coast, like here in the Bay Area, San Francisco or the Northeast - have incredibly high rates of upward mobility. But if you look at other places, like many cities in the industrial Midwest - think of places like Detroit or Cleveland, Ohio - these places have much lower rates of upward mobility. And when we look at families that move, we find that the earlier they make that move, the better their kids do in the long run. MARTIN: OK, but how can you disaggregate the who from the what? I mean, given that if you have the wherewithal to get yourself to San Francisco, which is a very expensive city, how could that not be about the person? CHETTY: So what we do is we don't actually just compare the outcomes of kids who made that move with kids who didn't make that move. What we're actually exploiting is the timing of when families make this move. So take a family that moved from Oakland to San Francisco with, say, a 9-year-old and a 13-year-old. We find the 9-year-old does better than her 13-year-old brother or sister in proportion to that four years of additional exposure to the schools and the environment in San Francisco. So those kinds of tests rule out the possibility that it's just different families because we're comparing kids within the same family. MARTIN: But going back to your first answer here, which is that, you know, you said it's a coin flip. Like, half of kids are earning less than their parents did and half of kids are earning more. How would any of those factors that you cited - you know, geography, better schools - change that? CHETTY: Look, so people usually talk about income inequality in the U.S. in the context of the current generation. How do we raise American workers' incomes? How do we deal with issues like globalization and competition with technology and so forth? And I think thinking about things like immigration or trade and so forth can matter for the current generation. But if you think about the next generation and going forward, my view is that what really matters in the end is education, investments in human capital starting at a young age, giving kids the opportunity to grow up in good neighborhoods, go to good schools, be exposed to a variety of pathways that will allow them to succeed themselves by having higher incomes. MARTIN: That's Raj Chetty. He's a professor of economics at Stanford. He is the founder of the Equality of Opportunity Project. He was nice enough to interrupt his weekend to speak to us from the studios at Stanford University. Professor Chetty, thank you so much for speaking with us. CHETTY: Thank you. Copyright © 2016 NPR.

npr,"December 18, 2016",Russian-Americans Wary Of Trump's Relationship With Putin," MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Now here's a different take on U.S.-Russia relations from a Russian-American enclave in Brighton Beach, N.Y. Charles Lane from WSHU spent some time there for this report. CHARLES LANE, BYLINE: Ukraine, Russia or Moldova, Brighton Beach is the landing strip for tens of thousands of migrants from the former USSR. CHRISTINA BONILLA: This is not America. This is Odessa. LANE: Christina Bonilla married an American, but she's from the Republic of Georgia. And she loves Trump even though Trump is seeking closer ties with Russia, which invaded her country back in 2008. BONILLA: Because this is two huge countries and two strong countries, but for me, very important. I don't care about Russia because Russia have fight with my country. I care about USA and Georgia. LANE: Bonilla embodies a dichotomy that pervades Brighton Beach. They hate Russia, but they love Trump, who is bringing the two countries closer than ever before. Alexander Adelman is a Russian Jew, a shoemaker who left Moscow in 1978. He listens to Russian radio all day, which tells him Trump is good. Do you like Putin? Vladimir Putin? ALEXANDER ADELMAN: Putin? We don't like him. I don't like, and all Russian don't like him. LANE: Adelman goes on to say that Trump can stand up to someone like Putin in order to keep the peace. ADELMAN: Trump don't give Putin, step on his feet. LANE: That's when Ada Sonis comes in to get her high heels repaired. She explains that Russians like tough macho men. ADA SONIS: Because of the history of the country. LANE: Sonis and Adelman, like so many other Russian-Americans here, fled a corrupt and brutal Soviet Union. They still fear it. And they say that Trump, with his arm around Putin, can keep Russia from taking more global power. But there's a flip side. So says Pat Singer, the founder of the Brighton Beach Neighborhood Association, a group that helps Russian migrants get access to government programs. PAT SINGER: Food stamps, Section 8, and they're going for man who's anti-government involvement. I don't know if they're looking at the big picture here. They're stabbing themselves in the foot. LANE: Singer is second-generation Ukrainian, and she marks a divide within the community. She says as children of migrants assimilate, they like Trump less. SIMONA BLACK: As a Russian-American, I don't quite get it myself. It just doesn't make sense to me. LANE: Simona Black is a 39-year-old makeup artist who grew up in the States. BLACK: They just think that he's just going to make everything better, make everything right. LANE: In Trump, Black sees the same things that her parents didn't like about the Soviets - a tough guy with lots of personal wealth and lots of promises that may or may not come true.

npr,"December 18, 2016","Almost 8 Years After 'Reset,' U.S.-Russia Tensions Ratchet Back Up"," MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  If you're following the news, then you probably know that tensions are high between the U.S. and Russia. Whether this is due to differing objectives related to the war in Syria or Russia's alleged cyberattacks of the presidential elections, many say U.S.-Russia relations are at their most difficult since the Cold War. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""STATE OF THE UNION"") JOHN MCCAIN: This is the sign of a possible unraveling of the world order that was established after World War II, which has made one of the most peaceful periods in the history of the world. MARTIN: That's Senator John McCain on CNN's ""State Of The Union"" this morning. He's one of four senators calling for a special bipartisan committee in Congress to investigate Russian hacking during the campaign season. But we thought this was a good time to step back and get a sense of what is behind all this, so we called NPR Moscow correspondent Lucian Kim to walk us through it. Lucian, thanks so much for joining us. LUCIAN KIM, BYLINE: Great to be with you, Michel. MARTIN: Donald Trump seems to have much warmer feelings toward Russian President Vladimir Putin than any recent administration. He says he wants better relations. So do you think this might be the moment where that could actually occur? KIM: Well, first of all, I think it's important to remember that George W. Bush also famously looked into Putin's eyes when he came into office. And then eight years later, Obama had the reset. I think Trump is going to realize pretty quickly that the U.S. has obligations to its allies, and many of those allies are afraid of Putin. And so you're right. Trump has suggested that he can make a deal. But I think he's also going to learn that Putin, you know, single-mindedly pursues his goals no matter what the U.S. says. MARTIN: Why has it been so difficult for the U.S. to come up with a workable relationship with Vladimir Putin? You remember that Margaret Thatcher, the former British prime minister, famously said of Gorbachev, you know what? I can do business with him. Why is it that the U.S. seems to have such a hard time doing business with Vladimir Putin? KIM: The funny thing is that that is exactly what Obama tried. He said, we're going to work on the things we can agree on and sort of put aside the things we disagree on. And the things the U.S. and Russia agreed on was, you know, Iran nuclear deal, fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan, nuclear nonproliferation. But as I said, Putin was still really suspicious of what the U.S. is really up to. So I think that Trump, you know, might be able to win him over if he stops talking about things like individual rights or free elections. But it's really unclear that a better relationship, you know, personal relationship between the two men could really be the basis for a better long-term relationship between the U.S. and Russia as countries. MARTIN: Before we let you go, Lucian, what does this look like from where you sit in Moscow? How are Russians reacting to all of these recent stories in the news, the accusations about the Kremlin having directed these cyberattacks with an effort to tip the scales of the U.S. elections? How does all that look from your end? KIM: Well, I think if you had to describe it in one word it would be mockery. Just this evening, the head of Russia's main state-run news agency - his name is Dmitry Kiselyov - he had his weekly news show. And he said outright that the CIA is perpetrating a coup against Donald Trump. He said they're not providing any evidence, we don't know who the sources are. And so he says the real reason for all that's going on in the U.S. is that the military industrial complex in the U.S. is backing Clinton. So, you know, from the point of view of the Kremlin, all that the - all these accusations swirling around only prove that the U.S. has lost the moral high ground and really isn't any better than Russia or any other country when it comes to cynical, dirty politics. MARTIN: That's NPR Moscow correspondent Lucian Kim. Lucian, thanks so much for speaking with us. KIM: Thanks, Michel. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"December 18, 2016",Who Can Settle Questions About Donald Trump's Conflicts Of Interest?," Since Donald Trump won the presidential election last month, his conflicts of interest have come into sharper focus. Ethics experts say that to clearly separate his role as president from his role as businessman, he must sell off his holdings. Trump has so far rejected that recommendation, saying via Twitter that he intends to have his two oldest sons run the Trump Organization. But those sons have been deeply engaged in the transition work of the incoming Trump administration. So now what? Ethicists say Trump must sell; Trump has shown no willingness to do so. For example, he had planned to hold a news conference to discuss conflicts of interests last week, but he has postponed it indefinitely. Can someone or something force Trump to comply with the ethics guidance that he has so far rejected? The best answer seems to be that only Congress can force Trump to make any changes. Let's walk through this messy, unprecedented situation one step at a time. The problem As the head of the Trump Organization, the incoming president has financial interests in hundreds of companies, spread over at least 20 countries. He also has many outstanding debts. His exact assets and debts are not known because he has refused to release tax records. The scant information available comes from a disclosure filing Trump made in May to the Office of Government Ethics. So while relatively few details are known, this much is obvious: Trump the businessman has many financial interests that would come into direct conflict with Trump the president. Examples of conflicts The conflicts are far too numerous to list here, but two examples provide a glimpse into how serious the problem is. The first involves the Philippines, where Trump licenses his name to Trump Tower at Century City, a huge project involving residential, commercial and retail space. His business partner there is Jose E.B. Antonio. After Trump won the election, the Philippines named Antonio as a special envoy to the United States. So in the future, Trump will face a question when he sits down with Antonio to discuss U.S. foreign policy in Southeast Asia: Is he acting in the best interests of all Americans — or in the best interests of Trump Tower's profits? Here's the second example, this one involving debt. Trump's disclosure form and other documents show he owes roughly $364 million to Deutsche Bank, headquartered in Frankfurt, Germany. But the U.S. Department of Justice is pursuing an immense fine — around $14 billion — from Deutsche Bank for its role in the 2008 financial crisis. If the Trump administration were to back off from demanding such a huge fine, would it be because that's the right policy for this country, or because Trump wants to curry favor with his German lender? As long as Trump is both president of the country and father of the men running the Trump Organization, questions constantly will arise about his motives. Ethics rules for presidents Decades ago, Congress wrote rules to prevent federal officials from having conflicts of interest, but they left the president exempt. Nevertheless, presidents have complied with the standards, putting their financial interests into a blind trust or investing only in simple instruments such as Treasury notes. Trump's plan to have his sons run the Trump Organization would not create a hands-off ""blind"" trust. In fact, sons Donald Jr. and Eric already have blurred the lines between their roles in the company and the incoming administration. For example, when Trump met with technology industry executives last week, his sons, along with daughter Ivanka, were seated at the table. Were the four Trumps listening for lucrative investment opportunities, or for good public-policy ideas? Walter Shaub, director of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, released a letter last week saying that ""transferring operational control of a company to one's children would not constitute the establishment of a qualified blind trust, nor would it eliminate conflicts of interest."" The stalemate So how does OGE normally enforce federal ethics rules? It does so by referring cases to the Department of Justice. But as noted, the president is technically exempt, and in any case, he chooses the attorney general to run DOJ, so that path to an ethics crackdown doesn't sound likely. But in addition to the federal ethics rules, the Constitution itself has an ""emoluments clause"" that says ""no person holding any office of profit or trust"" shall ""accept of any present, emolument, office or title, of any kind whatever, from any king, prince or foreign state"" unless Congress consents. So remember those two examples of conflicts, one involving a Philippines real estate project and the other, a German bank loan? What if Trump were to someday use his presidential clout to steer business to Trump Towers at Century City, or reduce Justice Department fines for Deutsche Bank in exchange for forgiveness of his company's debts? Such examples are entirely hypothetical. But if in the future, Congress were to discover that Trump took actions equivalent to accepting foreign bribes, then lawmakers could turn to another part of the U.S. Constitution: ""The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other High crimes and Misdemeanors."" Already, Democrats are making it clear they will be watching Trump conflicts closely. Last week, Senate Democrats introduced legislation requiring Trump to divest, and House Democrats held an event where ethics experts discussed Trump's conflicts.

Al Gore of the state of Tennessee has received 266 votes. ELVING: But Hillary Clinton's winning margin in the popular vote is nearly 3 million votes, almost six times larger than Gore's. That's one argument to sway an elector, but there's another. If you can't vote for Clinton, then how about exercising your own judgment for someone other than Clinton - another Republican perhaps? Could they do that? Well, yes, they could legally do it in 21 states that don't bind their electors to the results in that state. Most states have laws binding their electors to their results by law, but the penalty may only be a fine. Those who like this independent judgment idea are called Hamilton delegates, a reference to Alexander Hamilton, who helped sell the country on the Electoral College more than two centuries ago. It was a safeguard, he said, against the passions of the masses, and it was an alternative to having Congress choose the president. This is Hamilton's pitch. (SOUNDBITE OF LIBERTY TREE WIND PLAYERS PERFORMANCE OF JOHN REID'S ""MARCH OF THE 35TH REGIMENT"") UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: (Reading) The immediate election should be made by men most capable of analyzing the qualities adapted to the station and acting under circumstances favorable to deliberation and to a judicious combination of all the reasons and inducements which were proper to govern their choice. ELVING: But through the years, the Electoral College has not evolved as a separate decision-making body, as Hamilton envisioned. It's grown to be regarded more as a rubber stamp. This year, one Texas elector has said he cannot vote for Trump. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: And I'm a Republican elector. I'm going to vote for a Republican. It's just not going to be Donald Trump. ELVING: But it would take another three dozen like him to deny Trump a majority. And at that point, there would be no one with a majority and the question of the presidency would go to the House of Representatives to be resolved. Few doubt that this House would, at this juncture, elect Trump. But all that is likely moot at this point. The College shows no sign of blocking Donald Trump, and being ensconced in the Constitution as it is, the Electoral College is not going away anytime soon. Ron Elving, NPR News, Washington.

 NPR congressional correspondent Ailsa Chang poses with her Shih Tzu, Mickey. Mickey Chang is my effervescent, forever loving, black and white Shih Tzu. You may not know this, but the U.S. Capitol is the most dog-friendly workplace you will ever find. And come on — anyone who has to watch Congress all day needs a therapy dog. Besides, Mickey loves schmoozing with senators. Lawmakers have been bringing their dogs to the Capitol since the 1800s, according to the Senate Historian's Office. ""In the late 19th century and the early 20th century, all the reporting about dogs has to do with dogs fighting or being on the loose in some way,"" says Assistant Senate Historian Dan Holt. He says senators used to bring their hunting dogs into the Old Senate Chamber — to sit right by their feet during floor debates. ""The best story I found was Sen. George Edmunds of Vermont had a bull terrier. ... It was a dog that was bred for fighting, but he was very meek and didn't want to fight. And then one day, the dog got into a tussle with another dog, and from that day on, it had a taste for blood, and got into other fights with other senators' dogs,"" Holt says.

But it wasn't all blood and brawling. There were the dogs famous for their loving companionship. Sen. Thomas Schall of Minnesota, who was blind, had a beloved guide dog named Lux in the 1920s. A big Rottweiler named Mr. Ling used to ride in a Cadillac to work with Sen. Robert Kerr of Oklahoma. Sen. Harry Byrd of Virginia was always seen with a cocker spaniel named Candy.

""You want to see a friendly face. You know, Harry Truman said if you want to have a friend, get a dog. Sometimes that's true around here in Washington, D.C.,"" he says. There are plenty of people on the other side of aisle who agree. Like House Democrat Bill Foster of Illinois. Roaming around his office is an Alaskan Klee Kai named Shadow. She looks like a small husky. ""You know, being on the Financial Services Committee here — I use Shadow to investigative possible threats in the shadow banking system,"" Foster jokes. Foster says the reason Congress should have more dogs around is based on pure science. ""One of the fundamental scientific discoveries of the dog-human relationship is that when a dog looks into his master's eyes, you have a release of oxytocin — which is the trust hormone, the love hormone,"" says Foster. ""I think the amount of love and trust on Capitol Hill is often in short supply, and having more dogs here would probably make this place work better and maybe in a more bipartisan manner.""

npr,"December 17, 2016",Transgender Americans Race To Finish Paperwork Before Trump Administration," Many transgender people in the U.S. are rushing to change their designated gender on government documents before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. They worry the next administration may take that ability away. There's no indication so far that this is a priority for Trump. Mara Keisling with the National Center for Transgender Equality says Trump's positions on trans issues are not clear. But she's concerned about people he's nominated for key positions in his administration. ""Virtually every — if not every — appointment he has announced so far has been an extremely anti-LGBT person,"" says Keisling. She says trans advocacy groups around the country have been fielding calls from concerned people ever since the election. And they are not alone. ""The calls to our office have increased a lot,"" says Benjamin Jerner, managing partner of the Philadelphia law firm Jerner &amp; Palmer, which specializes in lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender legal issues. States control many government documents, such as birth certificates and driver's licenses, Jerner reassures his clients. A new president won't affect those. Of more concern, he says, are gender designations on federal documents such as passports, immigration papers and Social Security accounts. Jerner says passports are the biggest concern because State Department rules could be changed relatively easily under a new administration.

 Deciding whether to change gender designations on documents can be an especially tricky question for parents of transgender children. Jerner recently held a legal clinic for such parents in Philadelphia and says 18 families showed up. ""I think that just tells you the level of fear and anxiety that's out there,"" he says. Among those attending were the parents of 10-year-old Dylan, who was born a boy but — with her parents' encouragement — has long hair, wears pink and lives as a girl. That fits with guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics, the leading U.S. group of doctors serving children. The general idea is that parents should support their child and not make any big decisions that could limit the child's options in the future. That's because some children who appear to be transgender early on are not when they grow up. NPR agreed to use only first names for Dylan and her family. Some groups consider it a form of abuse to allow a child to transition to the opposite gender — even though it's in line with the AAP. Dylan's parents — Marla and Jennifer — say other families have had child abuse reports filed against them after they were identified in news stories. Marla says Dylan has identified herself as a girl for as long as she could talk. ""It took us about three years to really sort out with Dylan what that meant,"" Marla says. ""We kept telling her, 'Oh, there's lots of ways to be a boy — you can be a fancy boy, you can be a sparkly boy.' "" But Marla says Dylan steadfastly insisted she's a girl. Marla says they plan to administer puberty blockers when Dylan reaches that stage. That will make it easier for Dylan to physically transition to female later if she chooses. Dr. David Levine, a professor of pediatrics at Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta, says this is a good approach. ""I predict this 10-year-old is going to do great, because the parents are so on board and so supportive of their child,"" he says. Levine says he's not too worried that a Trump administration will make big changes that will affect transgender people. But he also is not opposed to parents who want to change their child's gender designations now because, technically, that's something that could be reversed in the future if it became necessary. Dylan's parents had planned to change her gender on government documents when she got a driver's license. Because of their concerns over the political climate, they are doing that now instead. So, on a recent evening — just as Dylan and her siblings were finishing up homework — a notary came to their home to witness Marla and Jennifer signing a short stack of papers. Once filed, they will change the gender listed on Dylan's birth certificate, Social Security account and passport — when she gets one — to female.

npr,"December 17, 2016",Why The Fall Of Aleppo Marks A Turning Point In Syria's War," ANDREW TABLER: Pleasure to be with you. MARTIN: So why is the fate of Aleppo considered to be such a turning point in the conflict? And do you think that it is? TABLER: It is a turning point. Aleppo is Syria's largest city. The rebels had taken over half of it in the summer of 2012. And controlling a major city in Syria was very important for the rebellion. And their attempt to hold it these last few years became sort of the heart of the revolution in many ways, particularly in the western part of the country. And the taking of Aleppo by the regime is a major setback for the rebels, but it's not going to end the war. MARTIN: It's not. Why not? TABLER: Well, two-thirds of Syrian territory is outside of Bashar al-Assad's control. Most famously, we have the eastern part of Syria, which is controlled by ISIS, but many of the rebel groups control areas in the northwest, the south. In the northeast, the Kurds and also other Arab tribes control other areas. So Syria's still a fragmented country, and Bashar al-Assad simply just does not have the troops to rapidly retake all those areas. So while Aleppo fell, and it's a victory for Assad, it is not the end of the war. And the dangers that have come out of the Syrian war for Syrians and those in the region and all over the world continue. MARTIN: Many people will have heard President Obama's press conference. The president was defending his position or his efforts to seek a diplomatic solution as opposed to using force. How do you think history's going to look back on the president's decisions here? TABLER: I think history's going to look very poorly on the president's decisions. By any measure, Syria's a humanitarian disaster, the largest since the Second World War. But, you know, to people like in the hometown that I'm from in Pennsylvania, the two things that really are going to continue driving this home and showing that President Obama's policy was a failure is the combined threat of terrorism and that of migrants that are coming out of this fragmented and broken country. And when these two streams crossed, they came to loosen up and to damage the societies throughout Europe that had been allies with the United States since the Second World War, brought Russia to the fore in the Middle East and even inspired, in the case of ISIS, a number of lone wolf attacks in the United States. And the war's not over. So I think that it's a stretch for President Obama to declare his Syria policy the best that we could have done. MARTIN: What do you see as the next steps here, particularly given the incoming Trump administration's perceived closeness to the Russians? TABLER: Right. I would imagine you're going to see two things. One is I would imagine a Trump administration will resurrect or implement what's called the Joint Implementation Group agreement, which was signed in late August and early September of this year but was not implemented when the U.S. accidentally bombed the regime position in the eastern part of Syria and then the Russians bombed an aid convoy coming into Aleppo. It's a quid pro quo. The U.S. agrees to target terrorist groups in Syria with Russia and synchronize their missions in exchange for aid deliveries to the opposition. They might have better luck doing that. So that's the first step. The second step could be, and this would be more controversial, the cutting off of covert aid program to the Syrian rebels. President-elect Trump has been critical of that. That would deny the rebels at least some U.S. military equipment. But cutting off that program would also deny the U.S. vital intelligence on those groups that are throughout Syria and could lead to unintended consequences for our intelligence gathering. MARTIN: That's Andrew Tabler. He's with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. He's the author of ""In The Lion's Den: An Eyewitness Account of Washington's Battle With Syria.""

npr,"December 17, 2016",How Diplomacy Time And Again Failed To Stop The Carnage In Syria," We're going to begin today with news in Syria. After months of war, Aleppo is back under the control of President Bashar al-Assad. The bombing has left the city in ruins and thousands dead. Evacuations of the remaining civilians there have been stop and go. It's a situation that weighs heavily on President Obama judging from his lengthy remarks at his press conference on Friday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: For years, we've worked to stop the civil war in Syria and alleviate human suffering. It has been one of the hardest issues that I've faced as president. MARTIN: President Obama also defended his decision not to use force to protect Syrians in the complicated civil war there. Instead, his secretary of state has tried and failed to find a diplomatic way out. NPR's Michele Kelemen reports. MICHELE KELEMEN, BYLINE: There are many losers in the war in Syria and that includes U.S. credibility, says Fred Hof, a former adviser on Syria at the State Department. FRED HOF: The Syrian regime, Russia and Iran have always believed from the beginning there is a military solution to the problem of Syria. The United States, its western European allies and others have always taken the opposite position, and you can still hear this being recited mantra-like. KELEMEN: Even this week as Aleppo was falling, the administration was still saying there's no military solution to this war. HOF: This mantra has been basically an excuse to do nothing to protect civilians inside Syria, absolutely nothing. KELEMEN: The U.S. tried on many occasions to work with Russia to find a diplomatic solution to the war. There was Geneva I and Geneva II, both attempts to get the warring sides to agree on a transitional government. And this past September after countless rounds of meetings with his Russian counterpart, Secretary of State John Kerry thought he had a deal for a cease-fire and humanitarian access to hundreds of thousands of Syrians. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOHN KERRY: Regrettably, for a number of different reasons, Syrian troops that were accidentally bombed at a humanitarian convoy that was not accidentally but purposefully destroyed by Assad's regime to start with and then by others who joined in - it fell apart. And everybody feels the pain of the lost moment of a lost opportunity. KELEMEN: Critics say there have been many lost moments in this war. They look back at President Obama's tough words when he declared in 2011 that President Bashar al-Assad lost legitimacy to rule Syria and again in 2012 when he drew a line in the sand. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) OBAMA: A red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized. That would change my calculus. KELEMEN: Instead of punishing the Syrian government for the 2013 sarin gas attack, Obama sent Kerry to Switzerland to negotiate an agreement to get rid of Syria's chemical weapons stockpile. It was a rare diplomatic success, though Syria has since used chlorine as a weapon. And by September 2015, Russian warplanes were raining bombs on rebel-held territory. Secretary Kerry has little leverage in his talks with Russia now, but he's still trying. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KERRY: The process has not succeeded mostly, in my judgment, because of the continued constant unwillingness of the Assad regime to live by those agreements to always press it, to always breakout, to always try to gain more territory. KELEMEN: The outgoing U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon also blames the diplomatic failure on those who, quote, ""stuck by narrow personal or national interests."" Ban has had three special envoys who he describes as the world's best diplomats try to resolve this war. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BAN KI-MOON: It's not an issue of negotiators and facilitators. It's an issue of a lack of solidarity, lack of compassion. KELEMEN: He was reflective in his final news conference on Friday saying the world failed the people of Syria, and the carnage there remains a, quote, ""gaping hole in the global conscience."" This clearly weighs on President Obama who says he spent many hours going over options with his military and diplomatic advisers. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) OBAMA: I understand the impulse to want to do something, but ultimately what I've had to do is to think about what can we sustain? What is realistic? KELEMEN: And he concluded that an intervention in Syria could not be done as he put it on the cheap. Michele Kelemen, NPR News, Washington Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

She is a Democrat and a former attorney general in her state. We wanted to speak with her about her history-making win and about what she hopes to accomplish in a Congress where both chambers and the White House are controlled by the Republican Party. She was nice enough to join us at our NPR headquarters in Washington, D.C. Senator-elect Cortez Masto, thank you so much for stopping by. CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO: Thank you for the invitation. MARTIN: During your victory speech on Election Night, you said that as a senator you will be a check and balance on Donald Trump. Actually, what you said is, I will be one hell of a check and balance on Donald Trump. What did you mean by that? MASTO: You know, what I was watching along with everyone else was somebody who was running to be president of the United States based on a platform of hate, discrimination and racism. And any time he wants to continue down that path, I'm going to hold him accountable. I'm going to be an advocate to ensure that we are protecting everyone and we're tearing down barriers and not building barriers. MARTIN: But how though, in, as we just said, in a Congress in which both houses are controlled by the party of the president, how do you see your role at a time like this? MASTO: Well, first of all, remember not everybody agrees with his point of view. In fact, as we know, he did not win the popular vote. And, secondly, if we're really talking about fighting for working families and ensuring we're bringing economic security back to them, and if that's what he claims that he wants to do, that's what we should be fighting for, and that means increasing that minimum wage, equal pay for equal work, keeping jobs here, middle-class tax breaks and tax cuts. If we are really fighting for working families and this current president has talked about keeping jobs here and talked about giving tax breaks to working families, we should all get behind that. MARTIN: Moving to a different topic now, immigration seems to be one of these issues that really divides Americans at this moment. Some people take the view that you have that these are hardworking people, that wanting a better life for yourself and for your family is not a crime. And there are other people who, both in their language, in their tone and philosophically, believe that this is just absolutely wrong. Is there really any reconciling these polar opposite views? MASTO: Yes. We've seen it happen before. We know that the United States Senate has passed comprehensive immigration reform. We know it can happen. And that, to me, is what we need to do. We have a broken immigration system. And I say this because we are a country that has always opened our doors. That's who we are. My grandfather came from Chihuahua, Mexico. And the reason he came to the United States and served in our military and became a United States citizen is because he wanted to ensure that if he worked hard he could succeed, but he could give his kids more opportunity than he would ever have. MARTIN: You are the first Latina ever to serve in the United States Senate. What does that mean? MASTO: To me, it's having a seat at the table. It's being a voice and having a different perspective and bringing that voice to the table to fight for issues that I know are important for not just people in Nevada but across this country. It is young women, young girls, that now know and see somebody in a position that they think that they can achieve. MARTIN: That's Catherine Cortez Masto. She is the senator-elect from Nevada. She takes her seat in January. She is a Democrat, the former attorney general from her state, and she was nice enough to interrupt her very busy transition schedule to stop by our Washington, D.C., studios to speak with us.

npr,"December 17, 2016",Severe Budget Cuts Loom As Puerto Rico's Debt Crisis Continues," MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Let's go to Puerto Rico for our next story. The Commonwealth is still mired in debt to the tune of nearly $70 billion. A federal oversight board is working on a plan to restructure at least some of that debt, but that could mean severe budget cuts. There's talk of shutting down such basic services as schools and hospitals, a prospect that could surely cast a cloud over Christmas for many island residents. So we thought this would be a good time to check in on Puerto Rico. Luis Trelles is a producer for the podcast Radio Ambulante. He joins us from San Juan to talk about how residents are coping. Luis, thanks so much for joining us. LUIS TRELLES, BYLINE: Oh, thank you. Thank you, Michel. MARTIN: So you've been covering the debt crisis over the past year. Could you just talk a little bit about the plan that's being discussed over the summer? As people will probably remember, Congress passed a law putting in place this federal oversight and management board. Can you just tell us a bit more? TRELLES: Exactly. The oversight board recently started to operate here. It's met three times now, and they recently announced for the people of Puerto Rico that they can expect deep cuts to the government in the coming year. And not only that, but government pensions might be on the table as well. So people are concerned. MARTIN: Can you tell us a little bit more about how conditions are there now? Are people feeling the effects of this debt crisis in any tangible way? TRELLES: Yes. Yes, they are. It's been a very hard year for Puerto Rico. It's been one bad news after the other in terms of the economy, in terms of austerity measures and the debt crisis. And so I talked with Teresa Garcia (ph). She's a retired chemist. She's in her 70s. She's very concerned about what's going on, and when I talked to her recently, this is what she told me. TERESA GARCIA: (Speaking Spanish). TRELLES: And what she's saying here is that she has definitely been affected because she doesn't receive what she used to get paid by the government. It's been cut down by about a third. And her husband is a diabetic, and he's been having trouble sleeping at night, you know, how economic worries have a tendency to creep up on you. And she's just concerned for herself and for her husband as well. MARTIN: I understand that, though, the cost of services is actually rising. I wanted to know, first of all, how is that possible? And secondly, how are people like Teresa Garcia coping? TRELLES: It's getting more expensive to live in Puerto Rico definitely. Gas prices are up. Electricity has usually been very high, and it's getting - the cost of it is getting higher. And people are feeling it. Teresa Garcia - she and her husband have really cut down on anything that is not basic household expenses. MARTIN: So many people look forward to Christmas at this time of year. What does Christmas look like in San Juan in the middle of all this? TRELLES: Well, the holiday season is very important. Usually in Puerto Rico people take it seriously. They look forward to it. But this year, it's been different. There's a tense calm that has settled over the island. People are expecting more cuts to come in the coming year. In previous years, you could see Christmas lights and decorations all around, but there's been none of that this year. And almost no one is decorating their house in part because of the rising power bills. But what's really interesting is that she just doesn't see that Christmas spirit this year and that she's not feeling it either. MARTIN: What lies ahead? Could you just give us some sense of what is coming in the coming months? TRELLES: Well, the oversight board has taken control of the island's finances, and they have the power to renegotiate some of that debt. But as part of that process, they will be looking for more and deeper austerity measures, so there's a wait-and-see attitude, and people are expecting that something better will come, but they're also bracing for what's ahead. MARTIN: That's Luis Trelles. He's a producer for NPR's Spanish language podcast Radio Ambulante. Luis, thanks so much for speaking with us. TRELLES: Thank you, Michel. Copyright © 2016 NPR.

She's the co-producer of the film ""August 28"" which is directed by Ava DuVernay who, incidentally, we are going to hear from later in this program. ""August 28"" is showing at the National Museum of African-American History and Culture, and Tammy Garnes joins us from member station WABE in Atlanta. Tammy Garnes, welcome back to you as well. TAMMY GARNES: Hey. MARTIN: So let's start with President Obama's final press conference of the year. It was yesterday. It went on for about an hour and a half. He talked about his accomplishments during his eight years in office in the economy, health insurance and foreign policy. And one statement that's making headlines is what he said about Russia. And this, of course, comes after news that Russia was behind the targeted leaks of emails and intended to interfere with U.S. elections. Just listen to a little bit of what the president had to say. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: The Russians can't change us or significantly weaken us. They are a smaller country. They are a weaker country. Their economy doesn't produce anything that anybody wants to buy except oil and gas and arms. They don't innovate, but they can impact us if we lose track of who we are. MARTIN: Well, Danielle Belton, I mean - a little bit more intense hearing it the second time. I'm going to start with you just - I'm asking just really a broader question of what stood out for you from the press conference? BELTON: You know, what stood out for me is, you know, President Obama is just a calm, collected person in a time that does not feel very calm or collected. And in some respects, it's - for some people, it's just not comforting. Like, it made me think of, you know - Michelle Goldberg wrote this piece in Slate about this and say how it's increasingly clear that Donald Trump won the election with a deliberate aid of Vladimir Putin. And the president-elect seems intent on rewarding his benefactor with a friendly state department. Like, it's - there's something genuinely, like, horrifying seems to be going on, and President Obama essentially is the meme of the character sitting in a room that's on fire saying this is fine. MARTIN: Interesting. Ron Christie, what about you? What was your takeaway? CHRISTIE: Well, I largely agree with Danielle. I think it's interesting that the incoming president-elect and the current president - they seem to be an antithesis of one another. And I looked at President Obama's press conference yesterday, and he was very nostalgic. He was wistful. It's clear that he'd spent a lot of time thinking about his last eight years in office and what he thought it meant to the country. And, obviously, as one who doesn't always agree with the president's policies or his politics, I thought he did a very good job of at least ending his term on a positive note while at the same time showing remarkable emotion from a man who doesn't show much emotion about the situation in Syria and in general in Aleppo in particular. MARTIN: Tammy, what about you? GARNES: You actually played my absolute favorite moment from the presser yesterday because, to me, when I heard that, I saw strength. I - that's what I saw. It was like the equivalent of an eye roll and a hand up and a - you know, it really to me was a moment where I said, you know what? He's right. They aren't stronger than us. We are bigger than them. They don't produce. You know what I mean? We are innovators. And I think in this time right now when we're all feeling the way many of us are feeling, every now and then you need someone to remind you of who you really are as you do in your everyday life. And as a country, I think, you know, the president right now is our reminder of who we are. When I look at him, I remember who we are, why we're here and what we said we were going to do as a people. And at the end of the press conference, he was clear that it's time to take a breath and reflect on how we can all get to a place where people are focused on working together. And we have a newly elected president. However you feel about that, you feel about that. But we do have a newly elected president, and I think more of us need to be in the place or the space where Obama is. MARTIN: Really, just really briefly here, Ron, I want to go back to you on this because I've heard a number of Republicans say particularly, you know, mainstream Washington Republicans that they actually find it annoying when he says this is not who we are, this is who we are, that they find that irritating. And I just wondered why that is and do you feel the same way? CHRISTIE: Well, it's a little bit irritating. I believe that we're all Americans, and it shouldn't be a reflection of this is who we are and this is who we aren't. This is, frankly, the country that we are. And it doesn't matter your race, your religion, your ethnicity, but I think a president's job for having worked for one is to find a way to unite the country and to bring people together, and I think all of us would agree that the incoming president-elect has a remarkable responsibility to bring us together as a country. And thus far, I have to say, I'm a little bit less than pleased with some of his antics. MARTIN: Speaking of which, Ron, another big news item this week was President-elect Donald Trump's reaching out to certain African-American celebrities. He met with Kanye West. He met with also the football luminaries Jim Brown and Ray Lewis. And - it - I don't - Ron... (LAUGHTER) MARTIN: I'm just trying to put that all together, and it seems to be reaching out to African-Americans through these celebs. What do you think? Is it, Ron? CHRISTIE: You know, I wrote an op-ed in The New York Times on Labor Day where I - it was entitled ""Donald Trump Talks Down To Black America."" And you have time to meet with Kanye before you come out with the secretary of state choice? You decide to sit down with celebrities? As if all celebrity folks speak for the African-American people. As if Kanye West - I mean, no offense - really speaks to a lot of the problems that go on in the African-American community. It just seems like it's a missed opportunity and a tone-deaf response to there are so many people who are out of work, so many people who are looking for opportunity and they don't want it from Kanye. They want it from a responsible leader. And I just think it's kind of bizarre. MARTIN: Hold on. Danielle, let's play some of Kanye just to tie a bow on it... (LAUGHTER) MARTIN: ...Just to see what he would say about - let's do it. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""I LOVE KANYE"") KANYE WEST: (Rapping) I miss the old Kanye, straight from the go Kanye. Chop up the soul Kanye, set on his goals Kanye. I hate the new Kanye, the bad mood Kanye. The always rude Kanye, spaz in the news Kanye. I miss the sweet Kanye, chop up the beats Kanye. I got to say at that time I'd like to... MARTIN: Not sure what the difference is. Danielle, go for it. What do you think? BELTON: All that was missing from this particular three-ring circus were like dancing bears. (LAUGHTER) BELTON: But it most certainly had a ring leader and three clowns. MARTIN: Yeah. BELTON: You know, I mean, I just feel like Donald Trump is just happy to get any black person to co-sign. He's not really picky about what type of black person it is. And then, you know, with Kanye - like, he should really be focused on his personal well-being, you know, not chasing headlines in the limelight like he... MARTIN: He does have millions of people who watch his every move. I mean, the fact is we are talking about him. It's almost like you can't take your eyes off him. I just have to say. I'm not trying to... BELTON: And he's addicted to that. And I think that's not a good thing. And I think like it hasn't been a good thing for him. Now, as for like, you know, Jim Brown and Ray Lewis - I mean, no comment. MARTIN: OK. (LAUGHTER) MARTIN: All right. Before we leave, Tammy, I'm going to just read this because I just want to get to our last topic, and I want to hear what you have to say about this. So for a lot of people, it has to be said the biggest news of the week has nothing to do with politics, but everything to do with intergalactic affairs. (Unintelligible). Here it is. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""ROGUE ONE"") FOREST WHITAKER: (As Saw Gerrera) The world is coming undone. DIEGO LUNA: (As Cassian Andor) Is he really doing this? I want to help. FELICITY JONES: (As Jyn Erso) Good. DONNIE YEN: (As Chirrut Imwe) I fear nothing. All is as the force wills it. MARTIN: Of course that was from ""Star Wars: Rogue One,"" and, Tammy, I'm going to you on this because I know that you are number-one fan, so... (LAUGHTER) GARNES: Actually, yes, you know, film is part of our life here. And I was reading a great article today by Kate Aronoff that was published, and she talks about how ""Star Wars"" goes. She equates the decisions being made right now actually - bringing us back to politics - by, like, mid-level employees and the EPA and the Department of Energy who have to decide if they're going to stay in this new administration and help build the Death Star. OK? Like they have to make these choices about whether they stay on the inside and actually help to impact, like, the future or if they jump ship literally. So I was really intrigued by that one. You know, ""Star Wars"" is ""Star Wars."" It's - this particular one is a little different. It's - you know, it's standalone... MARTIN: You've seen it already? GARNES: I have not seen it. It's the first in the series. I'm taking my kids tonight to see it. But it is, you know - there's a reason that people go to art in times of trouble, and it is because it is a release. And it's a place where we can all come together and actually, you know, forget the ills of what's happening out in the real world. MARTIN: Oh. Wow. An interesting take on this. OK, well, I was going to say no spoilers... GARNES: No... MARTIN: ...No spoilers. Once you all see it, then you can come back and tell me all about it, so Tammy Garnes, Danielle Belton, Ron Christie, thank you all so much. BELTON: Thank you. CHRISTIE: Thanks, Michel. GARNES: Thank you, Michel. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

npr,"December 17, 2016",Donald Trump Ordered For Deposition In D.C. Hotel Restaurant Case," In five weeks, President Donald Trump's inauguration parade will roll past his new luxury hotel near the White House. But just over two weeks from now, Trump has to sit down with several lawyers and give a sworn deposition in a lawsuit involving the hotel. What's the lawsuit about? Trump is suing two chefs who bailed out on the hotel after his declaration of candidacy in June 2015 — the speech in which he said Mexican immigrants are ""bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people."" Chefs Jose Andres and Geoffrey Zakarian, who had been building signature eateries in the historic Old Post Office building, cited the speech. Trump says they breached their contracts and is seeking $10 million from each of them. What's a deposition, and how important is it? A deposition, unlike a trial, is seeking information, not determining truth. They serve as a basis for trial questions, often to see if a witness's story changes. Witnesses at depositions have less leeway than trial witnesses in refusing to answer questions. Veteran Washington lawyer William Taylor III said, ""Depositions are taken by the other side for purposes of showing the person being deposed is either a liar or a crook."" There's usually no judge present at a deposition. Federal civil-trial rules, which apply in District of Columbia courts, allow depositions as long as seven hours. Trump's attorneys asked that the upcoming deposition be just two hours; D.C. Superior Court Judge Jennifer Di Toro turned them down. Trump has already been deposed in the Zakarian case. Trump's attorneys asked the judge to prevent those questions from being repeated next month. She refused. Doesn't Trump have presidential work to attend to? Clearly yes, but his lawyers didn't convince Judge Di Toro that it warranted postponing the deposition. They said Trump ""is extremely busy handling matters of very significant public importance."" She responded that the restaurant lawyers were working around his schedule, that Trump's own statements are crucial to the case and, besides, his company Trump LLC had started the legal action. Have other presidents-elect or presidents been deposed? Sitting presidents who have been deposed are Ulysses Grant, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton. Only one of their depositions has major historical significance. Clinton was deposed in 1998, in a sexual harassment suit by Paula Jones, a one-time government employee in Arkansas. It was the first time he was questioned about former White House intern Monica Lewinsky and their relationship. The deposition fueled investigations by independent counsel Kenneth Starr and House Republicans. In less than a year, House Republicans impeached Clinton. The Senate later voted to acquit him. Will the deposition be videotaped? Yes. Trump has been through many depositions, and video of the Zakarian session showed him to be a skilled witness, spare with his words and gestures. In other words, pretty much the opposite of his campaign persona. But whenever the video becomes public, his critics are certain to comb through it, examining both what he said and how he came across — looking for the kind of video moments that quickly flow into social media.

npr,"December 17, 2016",Trump Announces Nomination Of S.C.'s Mulvaney To Head Budget Office," President-elect Donald Trump is nominating Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C., to the Cabinet-level post of director of the Office of Management and Budget. Mulvaney, 49, has been in Congress since 2011; in that time, he has frequently pushed for tighter budget controls. ""We are going to do great things for the American people with Mick Mulvaney leading the Office of Management and Budget,"" Trump said in a press release announcing his pick. ""Right now we are nearly $20 trillion in debt, but Mick is a very high-energy leader with deep convictions for how to responsibly manage our nation's finances and save our country from drowning in red ink."" Mulvaney is a prominent member of the House Freedom Caucus, a group of around 40 conservatives that grew out of the Tea Party movement. The group often tangled with former Speaker John Boehner and backed Rep. Daniel Webster of Florida as his replacement. ""Mulvaney was not an early Trump backer during the presidential campaign,"" South Carolina's The State newspaper notes. ""He initially supported U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. for the Republican nomination. Mulvaney endorsed Trump in June, hours after House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. did the same."" As a federal sequestration loomed back in 2013, NPR's Tamara Keith attended one of Mulvaney's town hall meetings in South Carolina. At the time, Mulvaney said the sequester cuts were real and not just tricks of accounting — but he also said he'd prefer to replace them with more strategic cuts. Here's some of what the congressman said about the budget impasse: ""I'm comfortable that the federal government will continue to exist after the sequester. I don't think people are going to, you know, go to the streets and revolt when the U.S. Department of Commerce has to go back a couple of years in their budgets."" The Cabinet-level job of budget director requires Senate confirmation. With the choice, Trump now has four Cabinet-ranking jobs to fill, from Agriculture secretary and secretary of Veterans Affairs to two more economics-related posts: chair of the Council of Economic Advisers and U.S. trade representative.

npr,"December 17, 2016",Tense North Carolina Gubernatorial Race Rages On," Michael Bitzer joins us now. He's the provost and a professor of political science at Catawba College. Professor, thanks so much for being with us. MICHAEL BITZER: My pleasure. SIMON: What power have they taken away from the next governor? BITZER: Well, certainly it has been controversial, but I think, within the grand scheme of things, this is not unheard of. They have taken away certain powers in terms of appointments. When now Governor Pat McCrory came into office, he had a little over 400 appointees that the legislature had deemed at will for the governor to appoint. They actually increased that to 1,500. They are now returning it back to when Governor McCrory came in, and that's a little over 400. So folks are saying that that is stripping the governor's ability to shape the administration the way that he would want to. There's also been some changes in terms of shifting some appointees from the governor's control to the new superintendent of public instruction, which just so happens to have had a newly elected Republican come in, and then also issues about appointments to things like board of trustees of the UNC system. And also another major one is that they are invoking a constitutional provision to confirm Cabinet secretaries for the incoming Cooper administration, something that the state Senate has not done. SIMON: How did North Carolina become so divided politically? BITZER: Boy, I would have to point back to the elections of 2008 and 2010. We used to be - North Carolina, in 2000 and 2004, was a very heavily presidential Republican state. George W. Bush won the state by 13 percentage points. Come 2008, Barack Obama, with a massive ground game operation, really shifted the dynamics, won this state by less than half a percentage point. That got Republicans basically irritated and fired up. The tea party revolution in 2010 allowed the Republicans to capture, for the first time, complete control of the legislature. And I think that dynamic has played out. We have been a very competitive state, but we have also been a very partisan-driven state. And I think you're seeing this play out in these special sessions in the waning days of the McCrory administration. SIMON: Yeah. Changing demographics counts for a lot, too? BITZER: Very much so. And the in-migration of residents from outside of North Carolina, along with a tectonic shift in both urban politics and generational, particularly with the growth of millennials, is going to continue to make North Carolina very competitive going into the future. SIMON: Where Cooper is currently, the attorney general, can he overturn everything with a lawsuit? BITZER: He can certainly try, but I think that these - a lot of these provisions are within the parameters of the legislature. Governors typically have been very weak in North Carolina. I think that this is going to be pretty much the dynamic of what we're going to see moving forward with a Democratic governor and a super majority status of Republican control in the legislature. SIMON: Professor Michael Bitzer at Catawba College, thanks so much. BITZER: My pleasure. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"December 17, 2016",Tectonic Shifts In Climate Politics: Researchers Confused On Trump Era Consequences," CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: Glad to be here. SIMON: There's a new administration. Donald Trump will be president. Will it necessarily directly affect the work of these researchers? JOYCE: Yes, indeed. The U.S. government has a massive scientific enterprise on everything from bio medicine and - to climate. I mean, the climate effort by the U.S. government is second to none in the world, really. And there have been very mixed signals from Donald Trump about what he thinks about climate research. And he said it's a hoax. He said the science is unsettled, which the scientific community disagrees with vehemently. But on the other hand, he met with Al Gore to talk about climate. So scientists really don't know what to think. SIMON: Are they worried about their jobs? JOYCE: Some are. The people who work in the federal government - the scientists who do - are worried about their jobs. There's a lot of them. And the federal government and the scientists who work in the government do a tremendous amount of work that, you know, a veritable Mississippi River of research flows out of. The satellites that NASA provides, the buoys from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, flood gauges that determine, you know, river stages - I mean, it's a huge amount of information, huge amount of data. And people are worried that that could be undercut, to the point where there's even some guerrilla activity, you might say, of a few scientists who say they're urging their colleagues to back up their data in safe places because they're afraid that somebody might - from the government - might just delete it. There's no evidence that that will happen. But it is a concern. SIMON: What went on at this conference? Just discussion? JOYCE: Well, you know, the sessions were the usual things, you know, plate tectonics and river sedimentation and asteroids hitting the earth and that sort of thing. But in the hallways and over coffee or beer, it was all about Trump, Trump, Trump and the people he's picked to run the government. You could say that the community is rather split. There are scientists who say, wait and see. We've been through this before. George W. Bush was somewhat skeptical of climate when he came in and changed his mind. Maybe it'll get better. Who knows? Others are quite confrontational. And there was even a demonstration rally held by several dozen scientists carrying placards, which is something you don't often see senior scientists doing. And they were saying, you know, we're going to defend our science strongly. And don't try to undercut it. So, I mean, there's even a climate-change legal defense fund that's wandering around the meeting, offering its advice to people. So it has split people. SIMON: What would be the ramifications, if you can project, of the government actually cutting back on research efforts, if they were to do that? JOYCE: Well, the U.S. effort in climate research, as I said, is second to none. And, you know, the rest of the world looks to the United States for leadership in this area. It provides data not only for scientists within the government - for people who are in academia. And they depend on this. There's also the Paris climate agreement that was agreed to last December. The U.S. took a leadership position there. If the U.S. were to undercut its own research effort, that would, in turn, send a signal to others that, you know, perhaps the largest economy in the world is not going to bother with it anymore. And that could be a real anchor on holding back research in the future everywhere. SIMON: Christopher, did you hear any talk - any speculation - as to what some researchers will do if they find that federal money for climate science is cut? JOYCE: Right now, you know, people are - it's early days. A lot of people are advising calm. Stay calm. Keep your head down. Do your lab work. But at the same time, yes, there are some discussions going on about where to find money elsewhere if, indeed, the federal government under Donald Trump decides to cut back. You know, foundations, entrepreneurs with money - I'd say, right now let's stay tuned and see what they've got to find. SIMON: NPR's Christopher Joyce, thanks so much. JOYCE: You're welcome.

npr,"December 17, 2016",Study: Communities Most Affected By Opioid Epidemic Also Voted For Trump," SHANNON MONNAT: Thanks, Scott. SIMON: What did you look at, and what did you find? MONNAT: Well, so this was part of a larger project where I've been trying to understand the common characteristics of places with high rates of mortality from drugs, alcohol and suicide - these kinds of deaths of despair. And as you mentioned, I was watching the returns come in on election night and sort of noticed that the states where Trump was performing more strongly than expected, like Pennsylvania and Ohio and Michigan, were states that have seen major upticks in drug overdoses and other deaths of despair over the past decade. So I started looking at the data, especially within regions of the country where the opiate epidemic has received a lot of attention. And what I found was that Trump outperformed the previous Republican candidate Mitt Romney the most in counties with the highest drug, alcohol and suicide mortality rates. SIMON: And to take the chance of getting you a little bit out of your area of academic expertise for a moment, do you infer a lot of people who live in these areas heard a message of hope in Mr. Trump? MONNAT: You know, I think in many of the counties where he did the best, economic distress has really been building, and social and family networks have been breaking down for several decades. And so I think these findings reflect larger economic and social problems that sort of go beyond drug and alcohol abuse and suicide. It's really about downward mobility and the dismantling of the American dream at a larger community level. And Trump really has sort of capitalized on and exploited the feelings of the people in these communities. In a lot of these places, good-paying jobs and the dignity that goes along with those good-paying jobs has been replaced by suffering and hopelessness and the belief that people in power don't really care about them or their communities. SIMON: So on top of everything else, those of us who report politics and live in a bubble - we missed the importance of the opioid epidemic? MONNAT: I'm not so sure that it was missed, per se. I think it's been there at the forefront of the news for a really long time. I just don't think that we saw the potential that it would impact the election in the way that it did, insofar as it's tied up in these other economic and social struggles that are occurring within the same communities. SIMON: And to be clear again, you're not saying that people that have a problem with opioids or drug or alcohol voted for Donald Trump so much as people who live in those communities that have been affected by it statistically in your study voted for Donald Trump. MONNAT: Well, that's right. And I can't say necessarily who voted for Donald Trump, but we have to remember that addiction and depression and these diseases and deaths of despair go far beyond the individuals themselves who are affected by them. They affect friends and family members and coworkers and first responders and service providers and employers in communities who are dealing with the struggles of these and experience the same sort of frustration and anxiety that are associated or wrapped up within diseases and deaths of despair. SIMON: You conclude your study by - I believe the quote is community level well-being played an important role in this election. MONNAT: Yeah, that's right. So I think what we're seeing is the consequence of this perfect storm of decades of decline in these decent-paying jobs and benefits, especially for folks without a college degree, and little hope that those kinds of jobs will ever come back mixed with really easy access to pain pills and cheap and potent heroin. And on top of that, there's a lack of comprehensive and affordable health care services, including mental health and substance abuse treatment. SIMON: Professor Monnet, what do you hope a President Trump can do to help people who live in communities like this? MONNAT: Well, it seems to me that the policies really need to reflect the economic and health challenges of rural and small city America in the same ways that they've tried to target large urban cities. And that includes good-paying stable jobs, especially for those without a college degree. That needs to be the staple of any economic policy. What people really want is to be able to support themselves and their families. SIMON: Shannon Monnat, assistant professor of rural sociology and demographics at Penn State University, thanks so much for being with us. MONNAT: Thanks for having me, Scott. Copyright © 2016 NPR.

npr,"December 17, 2016",Critics Join Supporters On Trump's Florida Stop Of 'Thank-You' Tour," And NPR's Scott Horsley has been with Donald Trump, who's on a thank you tour. Last night, he spoke in Florida. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: Let's start off by saying Merry Christmas, everyone. Merry Christmas. (CHEERING) SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: The line of Christmas evergreens behind Donald Trump looked a little out of place in this semi-tropical environment. But the president-elect seemed very much at home here in his adopted state in front of an adoring crowd at the Central Florida Fairgrounds. These are some of the voters who helped Trump carry Florida and its 29 electoral votes on the way to a White House victory that defied so many expert forecasts. Both Trump and his supporters love retelling that story and how the news media got it wrong. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: They're very dishonest. They have written very dishonestly about all of us. It's a movement like they've never seen before. And yet we won, folks. We won, right? (CHEERING) HORSLEY: That suspicion of a hostile news media spills over into post-election stories about Russian hackers, possibly directed by Vladimir Putin himself, who set out to interfere in the U.S. election and swing it in the direction of Donald Trump. BETH YOUNG: It's questionable. You know, the mainstream media - I don't trust them. I don't believe them. I haven't for a long time. HORSLEY: Beth Young (ph) of Ocala, Fla., says the cyberattacks on the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign should be investigated. But she's not convinced the Russians are responsible, and she certainly doesn't think those hacks played a decisive role in the election. YOUNG: It's just more of the Clinton campaign trying to say, you know, she couldn't win on her own accord, so now she has to blame somebody else. HORSLEY: Some of Trump's Florida critics have seized on the hacking story, though. A small group of protesters gathered outside the fairgrounds, heckling Trump supporters as they came in. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Good job making Russia great again. HORSLEY: Grayson Lonzo (ph) notes Hillary Clinton actually outpolled Trump in this part of central Florida. GRAYSON LONZO: Orange County is our home, and he lost this county. This community rejected him and his ideals and the people who he supports. Because the election went their way doesn't mean they win forever. HORSLEY: Last night, though, protesters were far outnumbered by Trump supporters. Sean Tuthill (ph) of Crystal River is convinced the president-elect will bring good things to the country. SEAN TUTHILL: Like the thing I saw today on Facebook. He's a billionaire that gave up his cushy life to help us Americans. That's got to count for something. Our country is a big business. It needs to be run by people in business - period - not community organizers. HORSLEY: Trump reiterated his campaign promises to cut taxes, rollback regulations, repeal Obamacare and renegotiate trade agreements. In recent days, he's been alternating between these thank you rallies and meetings with his new Cabinet nominees, many of whom are wealthy businesspeople or retired military. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: You know, the media was saying, the people that are negotiating your trade deals are very rich. I said, but isn't that what we want? (CHEERING) TRUMP: And they said, why is it that the people protecting our border are generals? Because that's what we want. We want generals. We want generals. HORSLEY: Trump gloated a bit at the rally about being named Time magazine's Person of the Year, though he said he prefers the old title, Man of the Year. Trump added some of the credit should go to the often-maligned voters who turned out in such numbers to elect him. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: They're not so deplorable anymore. In fact, the other side's trying to figure out, well, in four years, how do we get some of these deplorable to our side, right? HORSLEY: There will be plenty of time to chew that over. For now, Trump and his team have an inauguration to plan, a government to organize and another thank you rally this afternoon in Mobile, Ala. Scott Horsley, NPR News, Orlando. Copyright © 2016 NPR.

npr,"December 17, 2016",Obama Suggests Putin Had Role As U.S. Recasts Antagonistic Relationship With Russia," (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) PRES BARACK OBAMA: What I can tell you is that the intelligence that I've seen gives me great confidence in their assessment that the Russians carried out this hack. SIMON: And he told our colleague Steve Inskeep this week the U.S. government will take action against Russia. We're joined now by Washington Post columnist David Ignatius. David, thanks so much for being with us. DAVID IGNATIUS: Good morning, Scott. SIMON: President Obama came into office notably pledging a reset on the U.S. relationship with Russia. As - even four years ago, he rather mocked Mitt Romney for saying Russia was the biggest threat to America. What happened? IGNATIUS: Well, I think Obama was astonished by the ways in which this weak, weak Russia found opportunities to destabilize the United States, also to invade Crimea, also to send military forces into into Syria. It ended up being a much more potent Russia than Obama had thought. And now this year, as the evidence mounted that the Russians were running a covert action against our political system, I think Obama has struggled to figure out what to - what to do about it. He finally really laid his cards on the table with this press conference yesterday. But what was striking was if he'd known so much, why didn't he do more after he begin to learn of the details in August, September, October, before the election. SIMON: He seemed to pledge in that interview with Steve Inskeep that the U.S. government would take some action against Russia. What's the range of action? Or is - or is that kind of brave talk at this point? IGNATIUS: I don't think presidents say things like that without meaning it, intending to deliver, but we have no idea what actions there might be. Certainly, there's a range that would include responding in kind. We've said that Russia attacked our political process - that they interfered with our political process. And you could do something similar. You could release information about Vladimir Putin. You could release information about his finances, his friends, his circle. That would be, you could argue, in kind. When I talk to officials, they say, we're so vulnerable in the cyber area ourselves that it's - there's a strong argument that we should respond in some other space - through financial sanctions, through other means - where we're not sitting in the glass house as we throw the rocks. SIMON: Is this a new Cold War? You covered the last one. IGNATIUS: It's looking like one. I must say, there's a kind of - a feeling of hubris. This is the kind of thing United States used to do to other countries. We were famous for our covert actions, destabilizing their political systems. A CIA official in the Cold War bragged that our propaganda assets around the world have the ability to manipulate other people's space was like a mighty Wurlitzer. You could sit at the keyboard and play all the notes you wanted. I saw a little piece from a Cuban who lived during the time when the CIA destabilized the Cuban president, Allende. So this was what we did to other people. Russia was doing it to us, but not effectively. The point I thought that was most... SIMON: Chilean president - Allende - I think. Yes. OK. IGNATIUS: Yes. Forgive me. Yes, the Chilean president. SIMON: Nothing undermined the Cuban president (laughter). IGNATIUS: No, that's right. Forgive me. I thought the most touching, chilling moment of Obama's press conference was he said these tactics will work against us to the extent that we are divided and vulnerable - that we're a soft target when we're arguing with ourselves. He made almost a plea to Congress to do a bipartisan unified report as a way of defending against this attack. If the country's together, the attacks going to be less successful. SIMON: Fifteen seconds left. Was the president naive about Russia, or are Republicans in Congress naive now? IGNATIUS: I think the president had overly generous hopes about what Russia could do in Syria. He always said let's leave for an exit ramp for them in Ukraine. Yes, that was naive. Now today as Republicans in Congress or Republicans around Donald Trump say no, no, no, it's not possible. Russia couldn't have done that. Baloney - the intelligence evidence is said to be very clear. SIMON: Thank you. David Ignatius, thanks so much. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"December 17, 2016",States And Cities Take Steps To Reform 'Dishonest' Bail System," Chudzinski couldn't make bail, so he remained behind bars for 34 days. ""I just had no choice but to sit there,"" Chudzinski recalled. While the drunken-driving charges stemming from his arrest were eventually dropped, Chudzinski has faced harsh consequences since leaving jail. He lost his motor home, and all of the possessions inside of it, to an impound lot. He couldn't afford the impound fees to reclaim the vehicle, so for the three months following his release, he lived in homeless shelters in Albuquerque. It is stories like these that propelled the New Mexico legislature to approve a state constitutional amendment to reform the use of bail for defendants awaiting trial. The amendment became law after winning the support of 87 percent of voters in this year's election. The state thus joined an increasing number of U.S. jurisdictions that have begun to implement risk-based systems of pre-trial detention as a potentially fairer and more effective alternative to traditional money bail. A discriminatory system? Reformers argue that current bail practices leave poorer individuals in jail while their wealthier, and possibly more dangerous, counterparts go free. It is common for judges to set bail based solely on the charges a defendant faces, without regard to the defendant's criminal history or financial means. ""It's really a dishonest way of detaining people,"" said Leo Romero, who chairs a committee the New Mexico Supreme Court appointed to lead the state's bail reform effort. The state high court prompted the reform effort with a ruling in 2014 that found that a defendant had been wrongly detained for more than two years on $250,000 bail. Walter Brown had been charged with murder, but the justices concluded that ""uncontroverted"" evidence showed he was not likely to pose a flight or safety risk if released. He had no criminal record or history of violence beyond the unproven murder charges. Plus, he would have family and community support outside of jail. In a unanimous opinion, the justices noted that the purpose of bail is to assure a defendant's appearance in court by the least restrictive means possible. ""The public doesn't realize that it's illegal for the judge to consciously use the amount of bond as a way to prevent someone from being released,"" Chief Justice Charles Daniels said in an interview with NPR. National data show that in 2009 a third of felony defendants in large urban counties remained in jail, because they could not post bail. The median cost of bail was $25,000 at the time, and that cost is particularly acute for poor defendants. Since 2015, several federal courts have declared the use of money bail for individuals who are too poor to post bond to be unconstitutional. Last month, San Francisco's city attorney declined to defend the city's bail system against a legal challenge brought by the civil-rights organization Equal Justice Under Law. Risk-based alternatives In recent years, dozens of cities and states throughout the country have begun to explore risk-based alternatives to bail. For example, the amendment New Mexico voters approved in November bars judges from detaining low-risk arrestees who can't make bail if they pose little threat of danger and are likely to appear for upcoming court dates. Romero's bail-reform committee has also proposed a rule to require judges to release low-level defendants who have been charged with misdemeanors or petty misdemeanors and have not been arrested in the previous two years. Municipal courts in 50 cities in Alabama have adopted similar reforms, according to an announcement by the Southern Poverty Law Center last week. New Mexico's bail amendment, however, permits judges to detain high-risk felony defendants if clear and convincing evidence shows that only such ""preventive detention"" will protect public safety. ""The fact that this is providing new authority to detain dangerous defendants,"" Daniels observed, makes the amendment ""comprehensive"" and was ""a large driver"" of its success at the polls. Some speculate that ballot language, which mentioned preventive detention before the possibility of no-bail release for low-level defendants, misled a large proportion of voters concerned about public safety into approving the amendment. ""It was meant to emphasize that you could hold a dangerous defendant,"" said Albuquerque public defender Jeff Rein, who represented Walter Brown at the New Mexico Supreme Court. In the end, ""the only people who were really opposed to the amendment were people like the Criminal Defense Lawyers Association,"" observed another public defender, Jonathan Ibarra. Indeed, the defense group and the ACLU withdrew their support for the amendment when lawmakers, buckling to pressure from the bail-bond industry, added language allowing judges to require proof of poverty from defendants who say they can't make bail. How do judges make accurate risk assessments? Courts in Albuquerque are testing a risk-assessment program from the Laura and John Arnold Foundation. The computer program uses the criminal records, current charges and age of defendants to compute individualized flight and safety risk scores to guide pre-trial decision making. It has gained increasing popularity with jurisdictions throughout the country, and last year the foundation reported that 29 cities and states, including Chicago, Charlotte, Arizona and New Jersey, had adopted it. Informed by risk scores, judges can release low- or medium-risk defendants on their own personal recognizance or set conditions for supervised release. Six states — Colorado, Hawaii, Nevada, New Jersey, Vermont and West Virginia — recently passed legislation to establish or expand pre-trial service agencies to administer conditions for release such as monthly phone calls, drug testing and electronic monitoring, according to a report by Harvard Law School's Criminal Justice Policy Program. Not everyone is in favor Law-enforcement officers have reservations about the use of computer programs to assess risk. ""It's important for judges and prosecutors to realize that these tools are meant to assist with their judgment, not to replace it,"" said Raúl Torrez, the newly elected District Attorney of Bernalillo County, where Albuquerque is located. Torrez said he will have his office build its own risk-assessment system in case the program the courts ultimately adopt does not strike the right balance between defendants' rights and community safety. ""We're in totally new territory,"" he said. ""As with all things, the devil is in the details."" Judges are hesitant, too. In Pittsburgh, for example, local judges followed recommendations from a risk assessment program in only 6 in 10 cases in 2014, according to a report the Institute of Politics at the University of Pittsburgh released last month. In New Mexico, bail committee chair Romero identified ""the mindset"" of judges and lawyers who are conditioned to the existing bail system as the biggest obstacle to reform. ""They grew up with this system,"" Romero said, ""They found it easy to apply."" New Mexico Chief Justice Daniels also acknowledged the pressure elected judges feel to hold defendants on high bail amounts so that ""they will have less criticism from the public for letting someone out if that person gets out and commits another crime."" ""It's really really difficult to convince a judge not to set a bond,"" public defender Rein added. ""There has to be a lot of courage for the whole system to work right."" In short, the ultimate test of whether bail reform will amount to much is now taking place in New Mexico. NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor ",http://www.npr.org/505852280
npr,"December 17, 2016",California Gets Ready To Defy Trump's Washington," A protest against President-elect Donald Trump in Los Angeles last month. Democrat Hillary Clinton drew 61 percent of the vote versus Trump's 31 percent in the country's most populous state. With Donald Trump set to become president next month and Republicans in control of both chambers of Congress, California's Democrats believe their state should take the lead in opposing the new administration's priorities. And they have no interest in calls for national unity. ""We must be defiant whenever justice, fairness, and righteousness require,"" State Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon recently told lawmakers. ""Californians do not need healing. We need to fight."" Rendon's message was greeted with rousing applause from Democrats, who command super-majorities in both chambers of the legislature. In the Obama administration, Republican-dominated states such as Texas often sought to block the president's agenda. In the Trump era, California may play that same role. Californians voted overwhelming for Hillary Clinton last month and Democrats believe many of their policies, such as the state's lenient stance toward immigrants in the country illegally, its strict anti-guns laws and its recent legalization of recreational marijuana, could be threatened by the Trump administration. Trump has called climate change, one the issues most important to Gov. Jerry Brown, a ""hoax."" ""The science is clear and the consequences are dire,"" Brown recently told reporters. ""So, based on those two facts, I think Washington will come around. But to the extent that they don't, we're going to be pushing as hard as we can from California."" Still, Brown intends to take a more wait-and-see approach on other issues compared to the hard-charging Democrats in the legislature. There are several ways the state may challenge Trump and congressional Republicans. It may simply choose not to not enforce some federal laws it disagrees with and enact stronger state laws around environmental and consumer regulations. The state is also likely to aggressively file lawsuits against the federal government. To that end, Brown's pick to be California's next attorney general, Congressman Xavier Becerra will play a high-profile role. Becerra said the state isn't looking to pick fights but won't be afraid to go to court either. ""My obligation is to protect my state, to promote the interests of my state,"" said Becerra. It may sound unusual for a liberal state like California to resort to an appeal to states' rights. For the past eight years, conservative states have argued for their autonomy with respect to the federal government. But states are opportunistic about their use of states' rights arguments and tend to employ them when their party doesn't control Washington, says Carlton Larson, a law professor at the University of California, Davis. Still, Larson says California may want to be careful about how much it uses that argument. ""If we were to push back very, very heavily against federal law, there's a real danger,"" that environmental and civil rights laws that depend on a broad reading of federal law could be endangered, said Larson. Democrats have already introduced one bill to better train defense attorneys on immigration law and another to fund legal representation for people facing deportation. Both are ""urgency measures"" meaning they would take effect immediately if they muster a two-thirds vote. The programs are expected to cost millions of dollars. Republicans lawmakers in California have criticized Democrats for taking legislative action before Trump is even sworn in. But Senate leader Kevin de Leon says Californians need reassuring. ""It's not our responsibility to read the tea leaves and predict what the president-elect may or may not do or what his administration may or may not do,"" de Leon said. ""It's our moral responsibility as Senators, as Assembly members, to do everything within our power to protect our constituents."" The Trump administration has plenty of tools to try to force California to comply. For instance, the state received nearly $96 billion in federal funds this year, according to the California Department of Finance. That sum didn't faze Governor Brown when he recently vowed to continue the state's aggressive approach to combating climate change. ""We have the laws, we have the tools of enforcement, and we have the political will,"" Brown said. ""And we will set the stage, we'll set the example and whatever Washington thinks they're doing, California is the future.""  That's a sentiment most California Democrats believe as they get ready for the next four years. NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor ",http://www.npr.org/505904428

 In his final press conference, Obama looked back on eight years, but pressing questions about Russian hacking and violence in Syria took center stage. President Obama held his final news conference of 2016 and painted a rosy picture of his tenure as president — from economic growth to foreign policy. So how did he hold up on the facts and what context did he leave out? We look at five different quotes: 1. ""The Syrian regime and its Russian and Iranian allies are trying to obfuscate the truth. The world should not be fooled, and the world will not forget."" President Obama accuses Russia and Syria of trying to ""obfuscate the truth"" in the city of Aleppo but says the world will not be fooled and will not forget. He says they are to blame for the atrocities unfolding there. The president says he does feel responsible, too. He is defending his decision, though, not to take any military action to tip the balance in Syria. He says it couldn't be done on the cheap. The Obama administration often argued that the choice was between diplomacy or military action, though activists argued there were other options short of sending in thousands of troops uninvited, including safe zones or targeted strikes on Syrian airfields to take out helicopters that were dropping barrel bombs and chlorine bombs on civilian areas. — Michele Kelemen, diplomacy correspondent 2. ""So with respect to Syria, what I have consistently done is taken the best course that I can to try to end the civil war while having also to take into account the long-term national security interests of the United States. And throughout this process, based on hours of meetings — if you tallied it up, days and weeks of meetings ... we went through every option in painful detail with maps and we had our military and we had our aid agencies and we had our diplomatic teams, and sometimes, we'd bring in outsiders who were critics of ours. ""Whenever we went through it, the challenge was that short of putting large numbers of U.S. troops on the ground uninvited, without any international law mandate, without sufficient support from Congress, at a time when we still had troops in Afghanistan and we still had troops in Iraq and we had just gone through over a decade of war and spent trillions of dollars ..."" President Obama talked about the only other option in Syria being large numbers of troops, but that's not necessarily so. His national security advisers four years ago wanted him to arm and train the rebels on a large scale. He decided against it. One of those advisers was Gen. James Mattis, Donald Trump's choice to run the Defense Department. Another was Hillary Clinton, as well as Obama's former CIA Director David Petraeus. Obama said permission, but he just sent 200 more. And Turkey never got permission but already has sent in combat troops, heading to Al Bab. — Tom Bowman, Pentagon reporter 3. ""There was a survey some of you saw where — not this just one poll, but pretty credible source, 37 percent of Republican voters approve of Putin. Over a third of Republican voters approve of Vladimir Putin, the former head of the KGB. Ronald Reagan would roll over in his grave."" Obama appears to be referring to a YouGov poll that showed a recent spike in Republicans' favorability of Vladimir Putin. Pollster Will Jordan tweeted a chart of this on Wednesday: Here is Republicans and Democrats on Vladimir Putin since July 2014. pic.twitter.com/s4I6FY5cbt And as Politico reported on Friday: ""Back in July 2014 just 10 percent of Republicans held a favorable view of Putin, according to a poll conducted by the Economist and YouGov. By September of 2016, that number rose to 24 percent. And it's even higher today: 37 percent of Republicans view Putin favorably, the poll found in December."" Republicans' favorability of Putin is still negative, but it is a sharp increase from where they were as recently as September. — Danielle Kurtzleben, political reporter 4. ""[T]he median household income grew at the fastest rate on record. In fact, income gains were actually larger for households at the bottom and the middle than for those at the top."" This is right — the median household income in the U.S. climbed by 5.2 percent between 2014 and 2015, to $56,516. That's the biggest jump since the Census Bureau started keeping track in 1967. In addition, income growth at the bottom and middle was stronger than it was at the top by those census data. Growth at the 10th percentile level was around 7.9 percent, a rate that declined as one went up the income ladder toward the median (that is, the 50th percentile). Median income grew by 5.2 percent. For people at the 90th percentile, it grew by nearly 2.9 percent. That said, how good the numbers look for lower income levels depends upon how they are sliced, not to mention which data one uses. As economist Emmanuel Saez pointed out at the Center for Equitable Growth in July, IRS data showed that incomes for people in the top percent of earners grew by 7.7 percent in 2015, compared with 3.9 percent for the bottom 99 percent. That's still solid growth for the 99 percent, and it could still mean strong growth in the bottom tiers of earners, but it suggests that in the top sliver of earners, income growth was once again stronger than for many people in lower classes. — Danielle Kurtzleben 5. ""And where Democrats are characterized as coastal, liberal, latte-sipping, you know, politically correct, out-of-touch folks, we have to be in those communities. And I've seen that, when we are in those communities, it makes a difference. That's how I became president. I became a U.S. senator not just because I had a strong base in Chicago, but because I was driving downstate Illinois and going to fish fries and sitting in VFW halls and talking to farmers."" There's no way of knowing how widespread the perception of Democrats as precious, out-of-touch, urban coastal elites is, nor how much it may have hurt Clinton and other Democrats in the election. However, it is altogether possible that the isolation from and resentment toward political power that many Americans feel pushed them to vote for Republicans. As one political scientist explained to NPR this year, that may be a force behind many rural Americans rejecting Clinton in favor of Trump. And Clinton really did tend to do far worse in rural areas than in urban areas. Her performance in those rural areas was also worse than Obama's in 2012, which in turn was worse than Obama's performance in those areas in 2008. Those declines in rural areas were much larger than any declines that took place over those same periods in suburban or urban areas. — Danielle Kurtzleben  NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor ",http://www.npr.org/505914255
npr,"December 16, 2016",North Carolina Governor Signs Law Limiting Power Of His Successor," Pat McCrory, North Carolina's outgoing Republican governor, has signed a law stripping executive powers from his successor, Democrat Roy Cooper. The law removes the State Board of Elections from the governor's control by reducing the number of members on the board from five — three of whom could be from the governor's party — to four members, evenly split between the parties. As we have reported, the change could have ripple effects, since the state body appoints members to county election boards across the state. Three of North Carolina's county election boards faced a legal challenge in November after they attempted to revoke the voting rights of thousands of registered voters shortly before Election Day. A federal judge blocked the move. The new law also increases the power of the state's appellate court and requires the party affiliations of judicial candidates to be printed on ballots. Jeff Tiberii of member station WUNC reports that ""protesters gathered at the N.C. General Assembly to voice their opposition to these Republican policy proposals and chanted in unison, 'Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Forward together, not one step back!' "" According to a tweet by Tiberii, Lt. Martin Brock of the General Assembly police force said his officers arrested 39 people during demonstrations at the Legislature building on Friday, and that 17 others had been arrested on Thursday. WUNC reported Cooper said the moves by state Republicans would have wide-ranging impacts in education, tax policy and health care, saying: ""They knew for weeks what they were going to do and they didn't tell the public. That's wrong. They need to put these issues out on the table so that the people know about them so that there's time to debate them."" On Friday, the Legislature also passed a second bill that would further curb the powers of the incoming administration. That bill, if McCrory signs it, would require Cooper's Cabinet secretaries to receive Senate confirmation, would significantly reduce the number of administrative positions in the executive branch, would strip the governor of his right to appoint trustees to the University of North Carolina and would take away some of the governor's power to oversee schools in the state. Republicans hold large majorities in both chambers of the state Legislature and will continue to do so when the new session begins in January. Cooper, the state's current attorney general, beat McCrory by a slim margin in the November election, and McCrory initially refused to concede until a vote recount proved he had lost by about 10,000 votes.

npr,"December 16, 2016",FBI Agrees With CIA On Russian Interference In Presidential Election," Major intelligence agencies now agree that Russia interfered in the U.S. election to help Donald Trump win the presidential race. Earlier reports had suggested there was a difference of opinions between the CIA and the FBI. NPR's Mary Louise Kelly has been covering this story. She joins us in the studio now. Welcome, Mary Louise. MARY LOUISE KELLY, BYLINE: Hey. Thank you, Audie. CORNISH: So what do we know officially at this point (laughter) about these agencies' views on this? KELLY: So according to an intelligence source who spoke to NPR, the heads of the CIA, the FBI and the director of National Intelligence all met this week. They got together, a kind of triumvirate of spy chiefs. And then today, this same intelligence source tells us, the CIA director, John Brennan, sent an internal memo to his workforce. That memo - and I will quote the bit that we were able to confirm - said, (reading) there is strong consensus among us on the scope, nature and intent of Russian interference in our presidential election. Intent would be the key word there because that has been what the reputed disagreement was. All the spy agencies had reached a consensus that Russia had interfered in the electoral process. The reputed disagreement was why. And now we're hearing, from - according to this CIA memo that went out to the workforce today at CIA headquarters in Langley, Va., that they are all three on the same page. CORNISH: So that idea of intent at issue - but why did earlier reports suggest that they just weren't on the same page? KELLY: Well, in part because members of Congress who have been briefed on the intelligence had suggested as much. They had received classified briefings from the FBI and the CIA. And afterward, some of them said they were left scratching their heads a little bit, trying to figure out - what should we make of this? Are you looking at the same facts or not, heads of FBI and CIA? I mean, you would hope that there would be dissenting views within the intelligence community and that there should be a healthy debate before some sort of consensus is arrived at. And it's also always worth stressing - the FBI, the CIA are very different organizations. FBI, historically - and still - is a law enforcement agency. The CIA is an intelligence spy agency. But all that said, a second intelligence source reached by NPR today said there is no gulf here. CORNISH: So given all that you've described, I mean, what's the significance of the fact that they're now all in agreement? KELLY: Well, I think, politically, this may increase pressure on President-elect Trump, who has resisted the findings of the intelligence community. It is harder to resist a unified intelligence community. He had dismissed the CIA assessments as ridiculous. He will now have to dismiss the assessments of the FBI and the DNI as well, and that gets a little bit more difficult. From the intelligence point of view, this is clearly a calculated move to leak the contents of the memo to news organizations to try to shut down speculation that the intelligence world is anything other than supremely united. It's also an attempt to back intelligence agencies out of the political fray, where they have very much found themselves in recent days. CORNISH: That's our national security correspondent Mary Louise Kelly. Mary Louise, thank you. KELLY: Thank you, Audie. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"December 16, 2016",Trump Selects Adviser David Friedman As Ambassador To Israel," President-elect Donald Trump plans to nominate his longtime confidant David Friedman to be the next U.S. ambassador to Israel. As NPR's Daniel Estrin reports from Jerusalem, it's a controversial choice. DANIEL ESTRIN, BYLINE: David Friedman is a real estate and bankruptcy lawyer. He's been close to Trump for 15 years. During the election campaign, Friedman advised Trump on Israel affairs. Friedman's been a commentator for Arutz Sheva, a news site affiliated with the West Bank settlement movement. Here's what he told the news site in May about Donald Trump's views on restarting Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DAVID FRIEDMAN: If Israel wants to pursue a peace process, he's happy to help. But he's not going to pressure Israel into things that they don't want to do. ESTRIN: The U.S. has long supported a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, establishing a Palestinian state on land Israel captured in 1967. The U.S. has repeatedly rejected Israeli settlement construction on that land. Trump's pick for ambassador has a completely different stance. Friedman has called the two-state approach an illusion. He serves as the president of an organization in the U.S. that fundraises for a West Bank settlement. In his May interview to the settler-affiliated news site, he said Trump supports settlements. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FRIEDMAN: His view is that Israel should continue to build settlements. Certainly, nothing has been undertaken by the Palestinians to cause Israel to second-guess that view. ESTRIN: Here's what else Friedman has said. He's accused President Obama of blatant anti-Semitism after the White House took a tough stance against Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer who is Jewish and who opposed the Iranian nuclear deal. He's taken aim at the liberal pro-Israel group J Street, calling its American Jewish supporters far worse than kapos, Jewish concentration camp prisoners who helped the Nazis. Former Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. Zalman Shoval says he doesn't give much weight to Friedman's past statements. ZALMAN SHOVAL: The incoming administration has not yet made up its policy with regards to many things but certainly with regards to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Therefore, any statement made at this stage is really irrelevant. The ambassador will have to act with regards to the policy which President Trump will set. ESTRIN: An official with the Israeli Prime Minister's Office told NPR Benjamin Netanyahu is pleased with David Friedman's appointment and looks forward to working closely with him. Friedman says he looks forward to serving as ambassador from a new U.S. embassy in Jerusalem. And that's a whole other delicate matter - Israel and the Palestinians have competing claims to Jerusalem. No country has its embassy in the city to avoid taking sides in the dispute. Palestinian official Hanan Ashrawi says Friedman as ambassador presiding from a U.S. embassy in Jerusalem would be a provocation. HANAN ASHRAWI: The U.S. is on a direct collision course with the region and with the Arab and Islamic world as well as with people of good conscience all over the world. ESTRIN: David Friedman's appointment still needs Senate confirmation. Liberal Jewish groups say they'll fight it. J Street, the group whose supporters Friedman called Nazi kapos, is calling Friedman's nomination reckless. Daniel Estrin, NPR News, Jerusalem. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"December 16, 2016",Obama Defends Response To Russian Hacking Of Democratic Party," President Obama is defending his administration's response to Russia's hacking of the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign. In a press conference today, Obama said his primary concern in the lead-up to the election was ensuring that voting systems weren't hacked as well. He said he told Russian President Vladimir Putin in September when they were both in China to, quote, ""cut it out."" Here's how he described what the consequences might be for Russia. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Our goal continues to be to send a clear message to Russia or others not to do this to us because we can do stuff to you. But it is also important for us to do that in a thoughtful, methodical way. Some of it we do publicly. Some of it we will do in a way that they know but not everybody will. CORNISH: NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith joins us now in the studio. Welcome, Tamara. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Hi. CORNISH: And we've been hearing about the latest, the CIA's assessment that Putin directed Russian meddling in the election to help Donald Trump win. What did President Obama have to say about that today? KEITH: The CIA's assessment remains classified. And the president didn't go so far as to publicly reveal its contents. But he did say that the hacking was directed by the highest levels of the Russian government and that not much happens in Russia without Vladimir Putin signing off. But, you know, a couple of times he came back to another idea - that the U.S. could be more vulnerable now to foreign interference because of the state of our politics, the heightened partisanship. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) OBAMA: Our vulnerability to Russia or any other foreign power is directly related to how divided, partisan, dysfunctional our political process is. KEITH: It is pretty remarkable that is the same man who 12 years ago was talking about there being no red states and no blue states, just the United States of America. CORNISH: Now this was a wide-ranging press conference. And President Obama was asked about the situation in Syria and whether he feels responsible in any way for the bloodshed that we're currently seeing in Aleppo. What did he have to say about that? KEITH: Well, he said that he does feel responsible - that he also feels responsible for a lot of things. And he defended his decision not to get the United States more involved in the Syrian civil war, casting blame on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his allies in Russia and Iran and insisting that there really was no better option. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) OBAMA: I understand the impulse to want to do something. But ultimately, what I've had to do is to think about - what can we sustain? What is realistic? And my first priority has to be, what's the right thing to do for America? KEITH: He said he tried dealing with it with diplomatic and political means. But he said he couldn't say that he's been successful, and that that's something he has to go to bed with every night. CORNISH: Before I let you go, the president was also asked repeatedly about the president-elect - his tweeting, his friendliness towards Russia. Did Obama go there? KEITH: He said that he's been talking to President-elect Trump and that those conversations have been cordial. He really didn't go there in criticizing the president-elect in any way but said that he may have more of a transition mindset right now and that once you're in the Oval Office, the weight of the office really hits you. CORNISH: That's NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith. Thank you so much, Tam. KEITH: You're welcome. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"December 16, 2016",Week In Politics: Russian Hacking Of Democrats," (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: And I should point out, by the way, part of why the Russians have been effective on this is because they don't go around announcing what they're doing. It's not like Putin's going around the world publicly saying - look what we did, wasn't that clever? He denies it. So the idea that somehow public shaming is going to be effective, I think, doesn't read the thought process in Russia very well. SIEGEL: Obama said he told Vladimir Putin to cut out the hacking when the two met in China in September. And there were no further hacks, he says. We'll stick with the subject of Russia now for a moment as we turn to our two political commentators, E.J. Dionne of The Washington Post and the Brookings Institution. Hi, E.J. E J DIONNE, BYLINE: Good to be with you. SIEGEL: And sitting in for David Brooks this week, Fred Barnes, executive editor of The Weekly Standard. FRED BARNES, BYLINE: Substituting for David Brooks, wow. SIEGEL: There you go. DIONNE: (Laughter). BARNES: I'm proud of that. SIEGEL: I want to... (LAUGHTER) SIEGEL: You should be. I want to hear from both of you. First, we'll start with you, E.J. How important is the idea of investigating what happened to the Russian hacks? How important were the Russian hacks? DIONNE: I think the Russian hacks combined with the Comey letter toward the end of the campaign were decisive. It doesn't mean Hillary Clinton didn't make mistakes. But I think they were very, very important. The WikiLeaks story dominated the news. It was just a day-after-day drip, drip, drip. And I think what's going to be very important - and there's already a fight about this - is how open is this investigation going to be? Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, after first being reserved about this whole Russia story said, yes, he's for an investigation. But he wants it done by the Intelligence Committee. John McCain wants a select committee, which would probably be more open. SIEGEL: Yeah. DIONNE: And I think a big issue is going to be, how much does the public get to learn about all this? The president says he's going to put out a report before he's out of there, so we'll probably know a lot before he leaves. SIEGEL: Fred, some Democrats even say there should be a 9/11-style commission... BARNES: True. SIEGEL: ...With public testimony. What do you think? BARNES: Well, I think that's overdoing it. But, you know, there was Lindsey Graham, the Republican senator from South Carolina - said he wants to hold hearings. And they would be public hearings. And I think that's fine. You can have the intelligence committees do it and have that, as well. I also agreed with - I didn't agree with very much in a piece in The Washington Post attacking the FBI by John Podesta. But he did say one thing that I agreed with, and that is the CIA should declassify all the information they have about what the Russians were doing and let us see it. SIEGEL: What kind of effect do you think all this talk of Russia will have, Fred, on the nomination of Rex Tillerson, decorated by Vladimir Putin... BARNES: Right. SIEGEL: ...After the big oil deal and the nominee to be secretary of state? BARNES: (Laughter) Well, he'll be asked about it a lot. But that's not the only thing. I mean - the problem with Tillerson is simply this. You have a president who is not very well schooled in foreign and national security affairs... SIEGEL: The president-elect you're talking about. BARNES: Yes, the president-elect, Donald Trump. And here you have a - on the basis of what we know now, you have the person he's nominated to be secretary of state, who - while he's traveled around the world and made oil and gas deals and so on, what does he know about foreign policy? Does he have positions? Does he - what - you don't want two neophytes in those jobs. DIONNE: Good point - I agree with that. I think you're going to see a fascinating split. You're already seeing a fascinating split in the Republican Party. You have people who are simply inclined to go with the person Donald Trump wants. You have people - again, to go back to Lindsey Graham and John McCain, maybe Marco Rubio - he's made some noises this way - who are very fearful of Tillerson's ties to Russia and the fact that he got an award for friendship to Russia from Vladimir Putin. And then you have this third element, which is many Republican establishment figures who aren't particularly close to Trump - some actually with ties to ExxonMobil - who are praising Tillerson as a kind of moderate internationalist. So I think you're going to have Democrats, on the whole, opposed. And then you're going to have this interesting split in the Republican Party. So it could be complicated for Tillerson. SIEGEL: It's interesting that Trump passed over Mitt Romney, who had said a few years ago that the great strategic rival would be Russia. BARNES: The - well, he was right. He was condemned at the time. But it was in - what? - the second debate, the third debate, I forget which one - and it was a fair point. And... DIONNE: And it's a point of view that Donald Trump very much would disagree with right now, it seems. BARNES: Well, you know, look, Donald Trump now - going into office, the thing you always say is - every president's said it - you know, I want to get along with people around the world and so on. And look, he said other things about Donald Trump earlier. But now I think this is standard for a president-elect. SIEGEL: All right, let's move on to another subject, Election Day - Monday, I mean, when 538 Americans... BARNES: (Laughter). SIEGEL: ...Actually take part in the real presidential election. They're the members of the Electoral College. There are claims of as many as 20 so-called faithless Republican electors who may not vote for Donald Trump. Moveon.org has a commercial, I think, aimed at electors or about electors. E.J., you wrote this week that the costs of breaking with tradition, that is doing what your state did, would be very high. Why are the costs so high? DIONNE: Well, the costs would be so high because since 1828, we've basically gone with the idea that the voters elect the electors; the electors vote the way the voters said. But I also said that while the costs are high, in this election, things are very unusual. First, Hillary Clinton actually won the popular vote by 2.8 million. Second, you have all of these questions swirling around about what the Russians did to help make Donald Trump president. And I went back to Federalist 68, where Alex - where he explained the Electoral College and he wrote that it's there to prevent a foreign power from, and I quote him, ""raising a creature of their own to the chief magistracy of the Union."" SIEGEL: We tried to get Hamilton to sit in for David Brooks today, by the way. (LAUGHTER) SIEGEL: We couldn't get him. DIONNE: Someday. And so I think - I think this year it's a way closer question for a lot of these electors. Having said that, I'd be surprised if enough defect to keep Trump from being president. BARNES: Yeah, I think - what do you need? - 37... SIEGEL: Yeah. BARNES: ...I think would have to defect. But I would... SIEGEL: Defect and vote for Hillary Clinton, both. BARNES: (Laughter) Well, sure. If they just took them away from him, then it would go to the... SIEGEL: To the House. BARNES: Go to the House. And Trump, presumably, would be elected. But I went back (laughter) - when I heard that E.J. was going to cite the - No. 68 in the Federalist Papers, I went back and read it, too. And it does describe their role as not just a knee-jerk voting role - that they're supposed to give it some thought. But the problem is - and look, we've had this argument before about faithless electors, and you never get very many. SIEGEL: But isn't the point that we work with the Electoral College on the assumption that it will reflect the popular vote? BARNES: Yeah. SIEGEL: And it's quirky when this happens. And there's - if it kept on happening, wouldn't there be a serious problem? BARNES: Well, there would be you. But usually, there's one or two faithless electors. That's it. That's not a problem. DIONNE: But I think it already is a big problem. We had it three times until 1996. And then we've had it twice since 2000. We're facing a real challenge for the Electoral College going forward. SIEGEL: E.J. Dionne of The Washington Post, Fred Barnes of The Weekly Standard - thanks to both of you. DIONNE: Thank you. BARNES: Thanks. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"December 16, 2016","FBI, CIA Agree That Russia Was Trying To Help Trump Win The Election"," Two intelligence sources say the FBI agrees with the CIA assessment that Russia interfered in the U.S. election, in part to help Donald Trump, clearing up any confusion and other reporting that the agencies weren't in sync. The entire intelligence community, in fact, is now in alignment that the hacks were partly motivated to try and install Trump as president. The FBI and others continue to say that Russia didn't actually think that was going to happen. An intelligence source also notes that a memo went out from CIA Director John Brennan to the agency's workforce Friday. Intelligence chiefs, including Brennan, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and FBI Director James Comey, met earlier this week, according to the memo, and, ""There is strong consensus among us on the scope, nature and intent of Russian interference in our presidential election."" The source confirmed that this quote, first published in the Washington Post, is an accurate reflection of the memo: ""The three of us also agree that our organizations, along with others, need to focus on completing the thorough review of this issue that has been directed by President Obama and which is being led by the DNI."" A second intelligence source tells NPR that media reports from a week or so ago saying there was a gulf between the CIA and the FBI position on the hack were overblown. ""A game of telephone on Capitol Hill led to a conflict narrative,"" the source said. ""There's no gulf here. The facts are the same."" This source adds there is still no date set yet for President-elect Trump to meet with Comey. Trump met Friday with outgoing Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson at Trump Tower in New York.

npr,"December 16, 2016","This Week In Race: A Verdict, The Donald, And The Other Donald"," Retrospective forecast: The racial weather this week started out stormy, offered a few hopeful rays of sunshine, then ended stormy. A guilty verdict in Charleston On Thursday, a jury in Charleston, S.C., found Dylann Roof guilty of the murders of nine churchgoers at the Mother Emanuel church. In June 2015, Roof shot the victims as they prayed during Bible study. From NPR's Rebecca Hersher: ""Roof also explained at least some of his motives. He said he felt he 'had to' commit the crime because 'no one else was brave enough' and explained to the agents that he believed white people 'already are the second-class citizens.' ""Roof said he had been inspired after he searched on Google for the phrase black-on-white crime in reaction to the killing of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, who was black, by neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman."" The story ""The Holy City"" tells itself Charleston, S.C., is nicknamed ""The Holy City"" because of its abundance of churches. The city, our teammate Gene Demby writes, tells itself a story that sometimes doesn't always jibe with history. Here's G.D.: ""Faith and race play big roles in the history of Charleston. In the stories the city tells itself about itself, Charleston joyfully celebrates the former, and rather impressively obfuscates the latter. That unacknowledged history coursed through the murder trials of Dylann Roof and former police Officer Michael Slager this month. The cases were different in important ways and ended that way — Slager's jury couldn't reach a verdict; Roof was convicted. But both came to be shaped by the politics of forgiveness, in which each case could be treated as tragedies that existed outside of any history that required acknowledgment."" Demby, NPR Do we all have the same definition of ""unbalanced""? Earlier this week, the Los Angeles Times published two reader letters that took issue with a story Times reporter Carolina Miranda wrote last month about the way national parks serve as reminders of our country's rocky history with race and civil rights. The letters were posted online with the headline, ""Letters to the Editor: Were the stories about Japanese internment during World War II unbalanced? Two letter writers think so,"" and were in defense of the internment of Japanese-American citizens. One reader went so far as to write, ""The interned Japanese were housed, fed, protected and cared for. Many who now complain would not even be alive if the internment had not been done."" Twitter, not surprisingly, lost its mind. The Times' readers' representative, Deidre Edgar, responded in a piece the following day, in which she astutely observed that the letters weren't ""civil, fact-based discourse."" ""Outraged readers found the opinions offensive and insensitive,"" she acknowledged. The paper, Edgar noted, would print responses in its Dec. 18 edition. Tit for tat, I guess. Miranda, Letter Writers, Edgar, Los Angeles Times And on the Twitters: what counts as ""discourse"" — or not Following The Daily Show host Trevor Noah's controversial interview with a white supremacist, and his controversial op-ed in the New York Times in which he called for a less divided nation, Gene tweeted a bit about the concept of the ""Overton Window,"" which provides the basis in public discourse for what is legitimate and what is unacceptable. ""Illegitimate ideas — and noxious/dangerous ones,"" he tweeted, ""creep into the universe of legit via the language of controversy and debate."" ""And slowly, the Overton Window shifts. And suddenly, the humanity of entire groups is a subject of legitimate, mainstream debate."" Demby, Twitter Ta-Nehisi Coates, on President Obama's legacy The Atlantic's Ta-Nehisi Coates recounts various conversations with President Obama and mulls over the first black president's legacy and shortcomings: ""For much of his presidency, a standard portion of Obama's speeches about race riffed on black people's need to turn off the television, stop eating junk food, and stop blaming white people for their problems. Obama would deliver this lecture to any black audience, regardless of context. It was bizarre, for instance, to see the president warning young men who'd just graduated from Morehouse College, one of the most storied black colleges in the country, about making 'excuses' and blaming whites. ""This part of the Obama formula is the most troubling, and least thought-out."" Coates, The Atlantic You should probably watch Donald Glover's TV show Atlanta The New Yorker's contributing writer Carrie Battan has this profile of actor Donald Glover, who plays the lead in the FX hit series Atlanta, the gorgeous homage to that city and its budding hip-hop scene. Glover, BTW, also raps under the name Childish Gambino, played Troy on Community and wrote for 30 Rock. As Battan noted about Glover, he has made a ""point of blurring the line between himself and his alter egos, between self-awareness and self-consciousness."" Battan, The New Yorker The other Donald says a thing On Thursday, President-elect Donald Trump gave a victory speech in Hershey, Pa., in which he called black people ""smart"" for not voting for Hillary Clinton. According to the Tribune News Services reports: ""Thursday's rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania, found the president-elect calling for the mostly white crowd to cheer for African-Americans who were 'smart' to heed his message and therefore 'didn't come out to vote' for his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. "" 'That was the big thing, so thank you to the African-American community,' "" Trump said. Chicago Tribune ""Politically correct"": The phrase is both shield and weapon I wrote about the origins of the phrase ""politically correct"" and traced its many meanings throughout time — starting in a 1793 U.S. Supreme Court case decision.

npr,"December 16, 2016",President Obama: America Is 'Stronger And More Respected' Today," President Obama said Friday he is leaving behind a more prosperous and safe country than the one he inherited from his predecessor. ""Almost every country on Earth sees America as stronger and more respected today than it was eight years ago,"" the president said at a White House news conference on Friday before the Obama family's departure to Hawaii for its annual holiday vacation. Obama ticked off a list of his economic milestones including lower unemployment, income growth, a tripling of the stock market and access to health care for 20 million Americans since he took office in 2009. On the foreign policy front, the president said he de-escalated the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and worked to forge new relationships with Iran and Cuba, as well as the Paris climate deal to combat man-made climate change. Obama also said he is committed to ensuring a smooth transition for President-elect Donald Trump. ""I think they would be the first to acknowledge that we have done everything we can to make sure that they are successful, as I promised, and that will continue."" The president described his interactions with Trump as ""cordial"" and said he will ""always make myself available to him just as previous presidents made themselves available to me as issues come up."" The president and Trump have very different views on the realities and motives of Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election. Trump has downplayed the Russian hacks and questioned the intelligence analysis of the Central Intelligence Agency that the Russians intervened to help Trump win the election. Obama side-stepped attempts to criticize Trump. Instead, he said he has ""great confidence"" in U.S. intelligence and their conclusions about Russia's influence. The president has ordered a report from U.S. intelligence agencies on the matter by Jan. 20, his last day in office. ""Not much happens in Russia without Vladmir Putin,"" Obama added, although he declined to explicitly state that he believes Putin ordered the hacking. ""Last I checked, there's not a lot of debate and democratic deliberation."" Obama reiterated that Russians were responsible for the hacks of Democratic Party emails but that they did not affect voting machines or the election outcome. ""This was not some elaborate, complicated espionage scheme,"" Obama said, though he did chastise the media for exhaustive coverage of Clinton campaign manager John Podesta's emails. Obama ducked when asked if the hacking cost Hillary Clinton the election. ""I'm going to let all the political pundits in this town have a long discussion about what happened in the election. It was a fascinating election."" He also warned that cybersecurity will remain a national security threat for the U.S. government and businesses. ""Our goal continues to be to send a clear message to Russia, or others, not to do this to us, because we can do stuff to you,"" he said. ""But it is also important for us to do that in a thoughtful, methodical way. Some of it we do publicly, some of it we will do in a way they know, but not everybody will."" Looking to his post-White House life, Obama said he will work to grow the Democratic Party. ""The thing we have to spend the most time on because it's the thing we have the most control over is: How do we make sure we are showing up in places where I think Democratic policies are needed, where they are helping, where they are making a difference."" He praised Labor Secretary Tom Perez, who is running to chair the Democratic National Committee. ""He is tireless; he is wicked smart,"" Obama said, although he stopped shy of endorsing him in the DNC race. On Syria, Obama spoke at length about his administration's hands-off approach to the civil war there. ""My first priority has to be, what's the right thing to do for America,"" he said, in reference to his decision not to commit ground troops to Syria — an act that would have required authorization from Congress. On China, Obama was forgiving of Trump's decision to speak by phone with the president of Taiwan. He said new presidents have the prerogative to examine the way things have been done in the past, and if they want to change them. But he cautioned to move deliberately and thoughtfully with China because Taiwan is at ""the heart of the conception as a nation."" The news conference was the last one for 2016. Asked on the way out whether he would have another before leaving office, Obama responded: ""I don't know, I'll have to reflect on that.""

npr,"December 16, 2016","In Leaked Remarks, Hillary Clinton Explains Putin's 'Beef' With Her"," Hillary Clinton has kept a low profile since losing the election to Donald Trump, but at a private event before donors Thursday night, she blamed her loss, in part, on ""some unprecedented factors"" — namely Russian hacking and the letter about the investigation into her email server released by FBI Director James Comey days before the election. ""Vladimir Putin himself directed the covert cyberattacks against our electoral system, against our democracy, apparently because he has a personal beef against me,"" Clinton said, per audio obtained by The New York Times. The event, for campaign donors, was closed to the press. In the remarks, Clinton ties the ""beef"" to the country's parliamentary elections in 2011, which as secretary of state, Clinton said were ""unfair, not free, illegitimate."" Around the time of those elections, Russian citizens took to the streets to protest Putin's power grab. ""Putin publicly blamed me for the outpouring of outrage by his own people,"" Clinton said. ""And that is the direct line between what he said back then and what he did in this election."" These were Clinton's most extensive remarks to date about the Russian hacking, how it may have related to her electoral loss and the origins of what NBC termed as Putin's ""vendetta"" against Clinton. Clinton has previously blamed the FBI, in part, for her loss. Her campaign staff also has talked about the FBI's role in the election earlier this month at a conference at Harvard's Institute of Politics examining the election results. Clinton's team blamed FBI Director James Comey's two letters in the final days of the campaign as well as Russian-linked hacking of the Democratic National Committee and campaign Chairman John Podesta's personal Gmail account. The argument, one which Clinton repeated last night, is that voters who were undecided until the end broke for Trump because of the Comey letter and the swirling controversy linked to daily WikiLeaks posts of internal campaign emails. In a Washington Post op-ed published Thursday night, Podesta argued the FBI's priorities were off, given that the agency apparently put more emphasis on investigating Clinton's use of a private email server while secretary of state than Russian interference in the U.S. election. ""Comparing the FBI's massive response to the overblown email scandal with the seemingly lackadaisical response to the very real Russian plot to subvert a national election shows that something is deeply broken at the FBI,"" Podesta wrote. Clinton herself attempted to argue that it was bigger than herself, saying she was pleased to see a bipartisan group of senators calling for an investigation into the hacking. ""This is an attack against our country. We are well beyond normal political concerns here,"" Clinton said. ""This is about the integrity of our democracy and the security of our nation."" President-elect Trump, however, continues to downplay the significance of the hacking, questioning whether it really was Russia: Are we talking about the same cyberattack where it was revealed that head of the DNC illegally gave Hillary the questions to the debate? The Senate Intelligence Committee released a statement, describing how it plans to proceed with its investigation into the hacking, and the intelligence community's conclusion that it was directed by people at the highest levels of the Russian government. ""Majority Leader McConnell and incoming Minority Leader Schumer have made it clear they expect any review of Russia's involvement in our nation's elections to be conducted in a bipartisan manner,"" the intelligence committee's statement reads. ""It is a charge the [committee] takes seriously."" The statement also says the committee will carry out the investigation expeditiously, ""but we will take the time to get it right and will not be influenced by uninformed discourse."" Some hearings will be public, but much of the work will be conducted behind closed doors because of the sensitive nature of the committee's work. As for the results of the election, some Democratic Party donors who spoke to Politico questioned whether the focus from Clinton's team on Comey and Russia is productive, saying a full postmortem of what went wrong in the campaign is still needed.

npr,"December 16, 2016",Trump To Nominate Bankruptcy Attorney As U.S. Ambassador To Israel," Donald Trump will take the oath of office five weeks from today. He has almost completely filled out his Cabinet, hired more White House staff. His latest choice, though, is grabbing headlines. The role of ambassador to Israel, he has chosen David Friedman. And to find out more about him, let's talk to NPR diplomatic correspondent Michele Kelemen who's in the studio. Michele, good morning. MICHELE KELEMEN, BYLINE: Good morning, David. GREENE: So David Friedman, a bankruptcy attorney - very little diplomatic experience, sounds like. What else do we know? KELEMEN: Well, no diplomatic experience at all really. GREENE: OK. KELEMEN: I mean, the main thing is that seems to have qualified him to get picked is a very close relationship with Donald Trump. Trump called him a trusted adviser on Israel in his statement. He highlighted the fact that this is someone who knows a lot about Israel's history, had his bar mitzvah at the Western Wall, speaks Hebrew. So these are the things that Donald Trump himself was highlighting about this pick. And what we know about his views, David Friedman's views, is that he doesn't think settlement-building in Palestinian areas is a obstacle to peace. In fact, he has gone on record really opposing the idea of a two-state solution. GREENE: The Obama administration, in support of a two-state solution, has always given the Israeli government trouble when it comes to settlements. This would be a very big break. KELEMEN: That's - it's a very big break. And the other big break from current U.S. policy is he wants to move the embassy, which is currently in Tel Aviv, to Jerusalem. Presidential candidates have made that promise in the past but have never followed through because of the sensitivity of that issue. GREENE: You know, I spoke about that very thing with a former head of Mossad, the Israeli security service. His name is Efraim Halevy. We talked to him last month. And I was asking him if, based on the intelligence, if there would be violence and reaction to those moves. And here's what he said. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) EFRAIM HALEVY: Violence is violence is violence. Violence could be a big outburst of activity which would, shall we say, plunge the whole area into a bloodbath. But I don't think this would happen. But even, should we say, controlled violence, like the violence we've had in the last couple of years with knives of the young children and so forth - violence is something, once it breaks out, you cannot even imagine how far it will go and how wide it will spread. GREENE: I suppose that speaks to how sensitive a position this is. And if Donald Trump has someone who is - takes a hard-line view, the impact on the region could be unpredictable. KELEMEN: And that's something that certainly the intelligence community here in the United States - and also, I know for a fact, the State Department has drawn up papers about this, whether or not the Trump administration is looking into that or reading those papers is a different story. I mean, Jerusalem is considered a final-status issue. It's one of the key issues that Israelis and Palestinians have to decide to negotiate before there's this idea of a two-state solution. They both claim Jerusalem as their capital. GREENE: And Michele, I mean - when ambassadors are chosen, oftentimes countries that are not that consequential, presidents might send, you know, even a big-time fundraiser. But to places like Russia, to places like Israel, to places like China, they usually send people with a long resume of diplomatic experience. Right? KELEMEN: That's true. But in this case, there's one thing that's going for David Friedman, and that is that he has the President-elect Trump's ear. He's a very close adviser to him. But he may also face a very tough confirmation fight. We're already hearing a lot of concern from liberal-leaning Jewish groups about that. GREENE: OK. NPR diplomatic correspondent Michele Kelemen.

npr,"December 16, 2016","Trump Family Tried To Auction Coffee With Ivanka, Raising Ethical Concerns"," Update at 10:55 a.m. ET: As this post was publishing, the auction for coffee with Ivanka Trump was pulled from the Charitybuzz website. The link now redirects to its home page, with no explanation. Our previous post continues: On the auction site Charitybuzz, you could bid $3,500 to have tea with Sarah Ferguson, the duchess of York. If you plunk down $5,000, you might be the top bidder for lunch with actress Julianna Margulies of The Good Wife.  Coffee with one Ivanka Trump, on the other hand, will cost you $77,888 — at least. The auction for coffee with President-elect Donald Trump's oldest daughter is a fundraiser for the Eric Trump Foundation, which says the proceeds will benefit St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. The New York Times has reported on the auction and raised questions about the ethical implications of selling off face time with the future first family — especially given Ivanka Trump's perceived influence over her father. The Times spoke with one of the bidders in the auction, investment manager Ozan Ozkural. He told the newspaper he wanted coffee with Ivanka in order to learn about what the president-elect might do in the future — especially in countries where Ozkural invests. The Times reports: ""Mr. Ozkural is one of several high-profile bidders in a feverish competition to win time with one of Mr. Trump's children. Other bidders include the owner of a Tex-Mex restaurant chain from Houston who wants to press Mr. Trump, through his daughter, about immigration policy, and a real estate executive and fringe presidential candidate from Florida who wants to send a message to Mr. Trump about election fraud. ""Now they may not get a chance to ""Enjoy Coffee with Ivanka Trump in NYC or DC"" ... Eric Trump told The New York Times on Thursday that he was considering shutting down the bidding — 10 days after it started — about an hour after The Times raised questions about the auction.""  ""Now they may not get a chance to ""Enjoy Coffee with Ivanka Trump in NYC or DC"" ... Eric Trump told The New York Times on Thursday that he was considering shutting down the bidding — 10 days after it started — about an hour after The Times raised questions about the auction."" Eric Trump told the Times that his foundation auctions off a meal with one of the Trump family members every year, and that it's ""nothing more than an effort to raise a lot of money"" to help children. The Charitybuzz site includes several now-closed lots for face time with the Trump family that, based on the source code of each page, appear to have been auctioned off during the presidential campaign. They include an ""internship"" featuring 15-minute meetings with Ivanka, Donald Jr. and Eric in the summer of 2016, and the opportunity to ""pitch your idea"" to both Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump sometime during 2017. The listings do not include any information about winning bids. (Updated at 2 p.m. with details on prior lots.) As NPR has reported, observers and analysts have repeatedly raised concerns about possible conflicts of interest related to the influence President-elect Trump's children might have in his administration — especially given his stated plans to leave his companies under family control, rather than putting them in a blind trust. Ivanka has been seen as playing a particularly key, and controversial, role as Donald Trump transitions to the White House. NPR's Jessica Taylor reported on one eyebrow-raising moment last month: ""Trump's daughter, Ivanka, sat in on a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe last week, raising questions about the mixing of the family's business and politics. There were initial reports that Trump had inquired about security clearance for his children, but the president-elect has denied that. Still, it's clear his children have influence with their father when it comes to politics, and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, Ivanka's husband, figures to play a potentially prominent role in a Trump White House, formally or informally.""

npr,"December 16, 2016","Trump Promises To Repeal Obamacare, Meets With Architect Of The Law"," It's in this atmosphere that Zeke Emanuel visited President-elect Trump this week. Emanuel was one of the architects of the Affordable Care Act, and he's in our studios. Good morning. EZEKIEL EMANUEL: Nice to be here. INSKEEP: So how'd the meeting go with President-elect Trump? EMANUEL: It went very well. INSKEEP: What's he like to talk to about health care? EMANUEL: I found him engaged, curious, and he asked a lot of thoughtful questions and had a lot of opinions, as you might expect. INSKEEP: Did you have a sense that he knows what he wants to do and what he wishes Congress to do? EMANUEL: Well, I'm not going to reveal what we talked about. That's for the president-elect's team to decide what they want to reveal. But I'll say he was definitely engaged and definitely asked a lot of thoughtful questions. INSKEEP: Well, let's talk about this situation. Here is President Obama's signature achievement - or one of them, anyway - which Republicans have vowed to repeal for years. But the president-elect has let it be known in public statements and elsewhere that he wants to keep some of the popular provisions, for example, making it so that you can't lose your health coverage because of a pre-existing condition or making it possible to keep your health insurance if you're a young adult and you're still on your parents' insurance. Republicans in Congress have put out their plans. What is your sense of what's going to happen here? Do you believe this law's going to - going to survive in some form, just under a different name? EMANUEL: Well, I think we're going to have to provide coverage for all Americans. I believe, on the campaign trail, President-elect Trump was committed to providing health coverage to all Americans. I think he has - he's said that publicly. And I think threading that needle is why health care is complicated. It's just as complicated for Democrats as Republicans, getting a way that's fiscally responsible to cover all Americans and a structure that is as simple as possible, but it's never going to be very simple. I mean, I think most people have to remember - it's a $3 trillion industry in America, 18 percent of GDP. That makes any change a very complicated arrangement. INSKEEP: Is that part of the - not just the practical problem, but the political problem here? Whatever you did in 2009, people barely understood it. People barely understand it now. And whatever changes are made, people are barely going to understand them. EMANUEL: That is only partially the problem. Remember, as you pointed out, there are many, many popular provisions in the bill. People like the fact that they don't have to pay deductibles or co-pays for preventative services - that was part of the legislation - that there are essential benefits which everyone can get, including mental health benefits and other benefits for drugs. So there are lots of popular provisions of the bill. The only unpopular provision, by polling, is really the individual mandate. But lots and lots of individual provisions get, like, 75 or 80 percent of the public supporting it. And I think that's an important point. INSKEEP: OK, let's cut to the chase here. That is the thing that Republicans hate most, the mandate, forcing people to buy insurance or else pay a tax penalty. It's been said, though, that it's connected to this other thing, making sure you don't lose your insurance for pre-existing conditions. It's been said you can't do one without the other. However, Republicans say, yeah, we've got ways to do that, there's some way to do that. Do you believe that this law can survive while getting rid of the mandate that many people hate? EMANUEL: There are only four ways - you have to get everyone in the system if you're actually going to get the pre-existing condition exclusion in there. INSKEEP: Everybody's got to be involved, you're saying. EMANUEL: Everyone's got to be involved. There are only four ways of doing that - an individual mandate with some kind of penalty, continuous coverage with serious penalties, some way of you have to pay more if you delay getting the bill, or we actually pre-re-enroll you - automatic enrollment and you can opt out. The problem with the continuous coverage provision and the provision for a penalty if you delay is that they don't work very well. So a mandate and automatic enrollment are ways that really work. INSKEEP: Are you arguing, in just about five seconds, the bottom line here is that people are going to have to pay something? They're going to have to be committed to something, whether they like it or not? EMANUEL: It's either through taxes or premiums or some way. People have to be involved in the system and engage if we want to actually cover everyone and make sure people who have cancer or other diseases get coverage. INSKEEP: Zeke Emanuel, thanks for coming by. EMANUEL: My pleasure. It was a pleasure to be with you. INSKEEP: He's at the University of Pennsylvania Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"December 16, 2016","Trump Holds Victory Rally In Hershey, Pa.; Takes Office In 5 Weeks"," Donald Trump will be taking the oath of office five weeks from today. And while he has almost completely filled out his Cabinet and hired more White House staff, Trump is still doing some of the other things that we have come to expect from him, like attacking critics on Twitter and reveling with his supporters. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: Now you're laid back. Hey, baby. Hey - onward, Mr. Trump, onward. Right? No, it's great. It's beautiful. In other words, you've won, and you feel great about it. And you don't have to go totally wild, right? It's much different. GREENE: President-elect Trump celebrating with supporters last night at a rally in Hershey, Pa. Let's bring in NPR national political correspondent Don Gonyea, who is on the line. He's been following the Trump transition. Morning, Don. DON GONYEA, BYLINE: Good morning. GREENE: So I mentioned Trump is nearly done filling his Cabinet out. And last night, he made his pick for ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, who is a bankruptcy lawyer - not a lot of diplomatic experience, it sounds like. GONYEA: Here's how Donald Trump describes him. He says he's a renowned attorney who's been counselor to some of the world's top businessmen and companies. So that's a pretty familiar thing to see on a Trump appointee's resume. He says he was one of the president-elect's principal advisers on U.S.-Israel relationships. He is a Hebrew speaker, a lifelong student of Israel history. And David, his bar mitzvah was held at the Western Wall in Jerusalem 45 years ago. So that's... GREENE: OK. Well, there you have it. There's the bio. This is a really important job. GONYEA: This is one of the big ambassadorships, just period, because of, you know, this place in the world. It's one of the most critical. And conservatives will be pleased by this pick. Liberals, including some liberal Jewish groups, will have anxiety, guaranteed. Friedman, for example, has said he looks forward to representing America, quote, ""from the U.S. embassy in Israel's eternal capital Jerusalem."" GREENE: Oh, that would mean moving the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which is highly controversial. GONYEA: Exactly. It's a promise Trump has made on the campaign trail. It's something that Congress has supported. But presidents have resisted it because it's a difficult thing to do because the status of Jerusalem is still in dispute. GREENE: So one of the big questions - what exactly will Trump start with? What's he going to focus on as soon as he takes office? Are we getting any sense? GONYEA: Yeah, we are. His incoming chief of staff, Reince Priebus, the current chairman of the Republican National Committee, did a radio interview this week with Hugh Hewitt. He laid it out. First order of business will be to repeal Obamacare. We expect that to be the first bill Congress takes up. It's not clear what they can do in terms of the replace-it side of the equation, but gutting it will be the first order of business. There's also been a lot of talk about how they're going to deal with reporters, the press corps, in the White House. Sean Spicer has been a spokesman for the transition. He was on Megyn Kelly last night on Fox News on her program. He said the daily briefing with the press secretary could go away. Give a listen. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""THE KELLY FILE"") SEAN SPICER: I think that's a view shared by a lot of former White House press secretaries - a view by some of the media, in fact, that the White House press briefings have become somewhat of a spectacle. And so maybe there's a more effective way of delivering the news and having a more, you know, appropriate, adult conversation with the media to inform them of the president's actions as opposed to an on-camera activity. But it's not a yes or a no. GONYEA: David, don't forget there is a Supreme Court vacancy hanging out there, so they're going to move on that very quickly as well. GREENE: Boy, that relationship with the press is going to be something very interesting to follow as Trump takes over. NPR's Don Gonyea talking to us about the Trump transition. Don, thanks.

npr,"December 16, 2016",'York Project' Revisited: 2008 Voters Weigh In On 2016 Race," In 2008, NPR gathered more than a dozen voters in a York, Pa., hotel. They had dinner and got to know one another, and over the course of several meetings that fall they spent hours sharing their views on an often uncomfortable subject: race. The York Project culminated when the voters gathered after Barack Obama's victory. Obama supporters were exultant. Some who voted for Republican John McCain had mixed feelings. They were excited about the historic moment but disappointed in the result. Now, after a very different election, Morning Edition host Steve Inskeep traveled back to York to follow up with four of those people. Their lives and their city have changed. Some of their viewpoints have changed, too. Yet this time, those whose candidate lost in 2008 were now on the winning side. Pennsylvania mattered in this election. The swing state helped decide the result. And York County went decisively for President-elect Donald Trump. When we gathered four of the '08 participants in York's Colonial Courthouse, they shared a range of ideas about what led to Trump's victory — and what kind of future his presidency might hold.

Weary, a registered Republican, crossed party lines in 2008 to vote for Obama. At the same time, he asserted in 2008 that any black advance causes some white people to feel like something is torn away from them. He says he sees Trump supporters who try to distance themselves from the white supremacists who also backed him. Even if other Trump voters don't consider themselves racist, he says, they are in essence enabling racism. ""I think that they definitely are saying that it's not that big a deal to them,"" he says. Weary suffered a heart attack just before the 2016 election, an event he now sees as a metaphor. ""You could kind of look at what just happened to us, was kind of like a heart attack,"" he says.

Yacoviello was a reluctant McCain supporter, and says she again had serious reservations this time around — so much so that, until now, only her family knew she supported Trump. That Trump is not your typical politician is refreshing, she says — but she sighs when asked if he's a role model, and says no. Instead, her support for Trump ultimately came down to his promises to cut taxes and reduce regulations on business owners. As someone who works in fundraising for charities, Yacoviello sees how policies helping affluent businesses end up affecting everyone else. ""The working class needs [philanthropists], and our country needs them,"" she says. Yacoviello says that, although she thought in 2008 that McCain better reflected her conservative values, she has grown to like Obama.

I think he's been an excellent president — a very good, excellent role model."" And she's sure he was opposed because of the color of his skin — even though his mom was white.

npr,"December 15, 2016",Obama On Russian Hacking: 'We Need To Take Action. And We Will'," U.S. intelligence officials have concluded that hackers working for Russia hacked into the Democratic National Committee's computer network, as well as the private email of John Podesta, a top adviser to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Russia responded Friday morning. Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin's spokesman, said the U.S. needs to show some proof or quit talking. ""It is necessary to either stop talking about it, or finally produce some evidence,"" he told Interfax, per the New York Times. ""Otherwise, it all begins to look quite unseemly."" With the question of Russia's ultimate motivation for the hack becoming increasingly divisive, Obama was careful to not endorse a CIA assessment, reported by NPR and other news outlets, that asserts that Russia's goal was to elect Trump. ""There are still a whole range of assessments taking place among the agencies,"" Obama told NPR, referring to an order he has given the U.S. intelligence community to conduct a full review of the cyberattacks before Inauguration Day. ""And so when I receive a final report, you know, we'll be able to, I think, give us a comprehensive and best guess as to those motivations. But that does not in any way, I think, detract from the basic point that everyone during the election perceived accurately — that in fact what the Russian hack had done was create more problems for the Clinton campaign than it had for the Trump campaign. ""There's no doubt that it contributed to an atmosphere in which the only focus for weeks at a time, months at a time were Hillary's emails, the Clinton Foundation, political gossip surrounding the DNC."" In fact, email had been a major focus since before Clinton formally entered the presidential race, owing to revelations first reported by the New York Times that she used a private email server during her tenure leading the State Department. Updates about the FBI's investigation of the server dripped out at intervals throughout the entire campaign. The State Department also released Clinton emails at semi-regular intervals throughout the campaign, as did the conservative group Judicial Watch, which obtained them through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit.

 NPR's Steve Inskeep interviews President Obama in the Cabinet Room of the White House on Thursday. Obama didn't pin the blame for Clinton's loss on the leaked information, saying, ""Elections can always turn out differently. You never know which factors are going to make a difference. But I have no doubt that it had some impact, just based on the coverage."" Obama said his goal is for a definitive White House report on the matter to be issued before President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. He was also careful to say that while the Russian hacks benefited Trump, he is not suggesting Trump's campaign helped coordinate the attacks or played any role in them, other than to exploit them for political advantage. ""They understood what everybody else understood, which was that this was not good for Hillary Clinton's campaign,"" the president said. Obama acknowledged that every ""big power"" spies and collects intelligence on each other, but, he said, ""There's a difference between that and the kind of malicious cyberattacks that steal trade secrets or engage in industrial espionage, something that we've seen the Chinese do. And there is a difference between that and activating intelligence in a way that's designed to influence elections."" Obama discussed cybersecurity with Vladimir Putin during a 90-minute meeting on the sidelines of the G-20 summit held in China in early September. The president characterized the meeting at the time as ""candid, blunt, businesslike."" While Obama is threatening to retaliate against Russia, he has only about five weeks left in the Oval Office. Trump has dismissed — in fact, mocked — intelligence assessments tying the DNC and Podesta hacks to Russia, and he campaigned on improving the U.S. relationship with the country. In his interview with NPR, Obama appeared mystified by that stance. ""The irony of all this, of course, is that for most of my presidency, there's been a pretty sizable wing of the Republican Party that has consistently criticized me for not being tough enough on Russia,"" he said. ""Some of those folks during the campaign endorsed Donald Trump, despite the fact that a central tenet of his foreign policy was we shouldn't be so tough on Russia. And that kind of inconsistency I think makes it appear, at least, that their particular position on Russia on any given day depends on what's politically expedient."" The president cited a recent Economist-YouGov poll that found Republican voters view Putin much more favorably now than they did before the 2016 presidential election. ""This is somebody, the former head of the KGB, who is responsible for crushing democracy in Russia, muzzling the press, throwing political dissidents in jail, countering American efforts to expand freedom at every turn; is currently making decisions that's leading to a slaughter in Syria. And a big chunk of the Republican Party, which prided itself during the Reagan era and for decades that followed as being the bulwark against Russian influence, now suddenly is embracing him.""

JEFF TIBERII, BYLINE: Well, at this point, they have set forth about two dozen bills, but the two that are of the most contentious - a deal with state elections boards and a deal with appointment powers. And essentially what they're trying to do is strip the incoming Democratic governor of some of his authority and some of, you know, the appointments of the powers that he generally has or she generally has. Under one of the proposals, 1,500 staff positions would be cut to 300. The governor would no longer have control over the state election board. And on top of that, governor's cabinet choices would have to go before the state Senate to receive confirmation. SIEGEL: Tell us a bit about these protests today and the arrests. TIBERII: This is nothing new in terms of hundreds - if in recent years, thousands - of people coming to the legislature to protest some of the policies that have been set forth. This all came about because of a special session that was called to give disaster relief to victims of hurricane flooding and wildfires in the western part of the state. But after they passed that unanimously, lawmakers entered into an unscheduled fourth special session. And that took place yesterday. Today there have been hundreds of people in and around the general assembly, chanting, voices echoing through the hallways. We've seen so far at least 20 arrests. And these are folks that say this is - you know, this is not legitimate government. There is a lack of transparency here. And what the Republicans supermajorities are doing quite simply is an 11th hour power grab. SIEGEL: And what happens next here? First of all, do the Republicans have the votes to approve what you - what is - what dissenters call a power grab? And if so, what happens? TIBERII: Well, it's a good question. At this point, we have seen - there are two controversial bills. One is in each chamber, and we've seen chambers advance these bills. They have enough votes to pass them, but there is a measure that advanced in the House on Thursday, and it didn't advance by 72 votes, which means that it's not a veto-proof majority at this point of support, which means that one of these bills where they are proposing taking away executive authority now goes to the executive. That is a Republican - lame duck Republican Governor Pat McCrory. We will see if he in fact signs this. I mean that's a little bit of a wrinkle looking ahead, you know? He's perhaps a Republican first and a governor second. The - you know, the Republicans say that they are in good standing here, that constitutionally what they're doing is what they're allowed to do. Democrats have essentially promised that there will be legal challenges to this, and the attorney general, who happens to be Roy Cooper, the governor-elect, said this morning that if the lawmakers do anything he deems unconstitutional, that he'll see them in court. SIEGEL: Well, it all sounds very dramatic and very complicated. Thanks, Jeff. TIBERII: Thank you. SIEGEL: That's Jeff Tiberii in Raleigh, N.C. He is a political reporter for member station WUNC.

npr,"December 15, 2016",'RT America': The One News Outlet For Which Trump Retains An Unexpected Affinity," For all of the vitriol Donald Trump aimed at the press during the campaign, there's one news outlet that he and others in his inner circle seem to be comfortable with. It's RT America, originally known as Russia Today. In the U.S., it's widely seen as a propaganda arm of the Kremlin, which owns and funds it. NPR's David Folkenflik looks at RT's ties to the incoming administration. DAVID FOLKENFLIK, BYLINE: American TV networks are broadcasting searing tales from the Syrian city of Aleppo, home to some of the worst fighting in that country's civil war - this from ABC News. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""ABC NEWS"") UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: This is one of the biggest humanitarian crises in the world and one that the next American president will have to deal with on day one. FOLKENFLIK: A different tenor prevails at RT America. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MARIA FINOSHINA: But we start with Aleppo of course. PRESIDENT BASHAR AL-ASSAD: Yeah. FOLKENFLIK: RT's Maria Finoshina landed a rare interview with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and she offered a sympathetic hearing. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FINOSHINA: But the Western politicians and Western media have been largely negative about your army's advance. Why you think this is happening? Do they take it as their Rome defeat? FOLKENFLIK: RT America has a modest audience, exploring stories of dissent, injustice and poverty within the U.S. that it says American news outlets ignore. Former MSNBC host Ed Schultz joined the network back in January. ED SCHULTZ: Our mission is to be fair and factual, to go deeper than the soundbite of 20 seconds, to have a broader scope and to get both sides. FOLKENFLIK: Schultz made a mark as an outspoken liberal on radio and MSNBC for years. He is now RT America's chief news anchor. SCHULTZ: And I'm very proud of the fact that I anchor a newscast that does just that. FOLKENFLIK: Many American analysts call RT's work outright propaganda for a country now accused of trying to tamper with the 2016 presidential elections. JAMES MILLER: RT has played a key role in sort of advancing a narrative that the Russian government is fundamentally trustworthy, whereas the American government is fundamentally untrustworthy. FOLKENFLIK: James Miller is managing editor of The Interpreter, a site covering Russian foreign and domestic policy. MILLER: RT sort of kicks up dust on stories like what's going on in Syria. They don't as much convince people that their version of the story is true as much as they do sort of implant doubt as to whether or not the truth can be known at all. FOLKENFLIK: Liz Wahl was a correspondent, an anchor for RT America for several years. Over time, she says, the network increasingly amplified the Kremlin's agenda in places like Ukraine and Syria. LIZ WAHL: We were not meant to deliver the truth but to skew what was happening there. I think RT is just part of a greater Russian disinformation machine. FOLKENFLIK: Wahl ultimately resigned live on the air. Several figures with ties to Trump have appeared on RT's shows, such as Trump's incoming national security adviser, retired General Michael Flynn, a former military intelligence chief. Last December at a banquet celebrating RT's 10th anniversary in Moscow, Flynn sat next to RT's top editor and just two seats away from Russian leader Vladimir Putin. Flynn participated in a Q&amp;A; there, an appearance for which he was paid by RT. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MICHAEL FLYNN: First of all, thank you so much for inviting me and having me here. FOLKENFLIK: Trump himself appeared on RT back in September on former CNN talk show host Larry King's program. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""LARRY KING NOW"") DONALD TRUMP: The media has been unbelievably dishonest. I mean they'll take a statement that you make which is perfect, and they'll cut it up and chop it up. FOLKENFLIK: Trump's camp said he was misled into thinking he was just speaking for King's podcast, yet Trump has praised Putin lavishly and repeatedly as a decisive leader and as a counterpoint to President Barack Obama. On MSNBC, Ed Schultz mocked conservatives for making a hero of Putin. Here's what Schultz told me this week. SCHULTZ: I view Putin as a protector of the country. There's been a lot of bad history and a lot of bad actors on Russia in the past, and I think that he doesn't want to repeat that history. And I think that's his concern. FOLKENFLIK: Schultz has also previously called Donald Trump a racist. Now... SCHULTZ: He is the change agent that America has been looking for. FOLKENFLIK: For now, the incoming American president is enjoying a warm reception from the Russian president's American news channel. David Folkenflik, NPR News. Copyright © 2016 NPR.

npr,"December 15, 2016",No Permits Yet Granted To Expected Inauguration Protesters," Lots of people are making plans to come to Washington, D.C., next month for President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration. Some will come and cheer. Others plan to protest, but there's some controversy over where they'll get to do that. NPR's Pam Fessler reports. PAM FESSLER, BYLINE: Thousands of protesters greeted George W. Bush's motorcade as it rolled down Pennsylvania Avenue in January 2001. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Chanting, unintelligible). FESSLER: And now some people are hoping to give Donald Trump a similar greeting, if not on Inauguration Day, then on his first full day in office. YASMINA MRABET: We have buses coming from Philadelphia, New York, New Haven, Boston, Chicago, cities in Florida. FESSLER: Yasmina Mrabet is an organizer with a left-wing group called the ANSWER Coalition. It expects to bring in tens of thousands of protesters with one simple message. MRABET: Our slogan is stop the Trump agenda. FESSLER: Especially when it comes to restrictions on immigrants, Muslims and women. These protesters hope to get as close as they can to the parade on Inauguration Day and to march the next day from the Trump Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue towards the White House. On that day, they might also join up with many thousands of others heading to Washington for what's being called the Women's March. MRINALINI CHAKRABORTY: We all just felt like we needed to do something. FESSLER: Mrinalini Chakraborty is the Illinois organizer for the march which she says is a national grassroots response to the frustration that many people felt after Trump's election. She expects as many as 60 busloads of marchers from her state alone. CHAKRABORTY: I can only hope that this massive gathering, you know, reminds him that now he is president, and he represents all of us. FESSLER: But it's not clear just how close the protesters will be able to get to Trump. The Women's March has received a permit to gather near the Capitol, but it was unable, like other groups, to get permits to demonstrate at the Lincoln Memorial or other sites closer to the White House. The National Park Service has given Trump's Presidential Inaugural Committee the right of first refusal for most of these sites. Park Service spokesman Mike Litterst says once the committee decides what it needs, they can begin handing out permits to the more than 20 other groups that have applied. MIKE LITTERST: I think what a lot of people are missing is that this is a process and procedures that are established in the Code of Federal Regulations, and they are applied equally across the board regardless of who had won. FESSLER: But some groups like the ANSWER Coalition are challenging that process in court. Mara Verheyden-Hilliard is an attorney with the Partnership for Civil Justice Fund. She says barring the protesters from federal land is unconstitutional. MARA VERHEYDEN-HILLIARD: When you have an incoming administration, the people have the right to communicate to that administration what they think and what they believe. FESSLER: The park service responds that much of the area along the parade route is already open to the public and that it's doing what it can to accommodate everyone's requests. In fact, one group - Bikers for Trump - has already gotten the OK to use a park near the Capitol that wasn't set aside for the inaugural committee. Bikers for Trump expects to have 5,000 motorcyclists in town to celebrate Trump's election. Pam Fessler, NPR News, Washington. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"December 15, 2016",Former U.S. Ambassador Says Russian Hacking Of DNC Emails Seems 'Plausible'," The Russian hacking plot thickens. U.S. intelligence has concluded that Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee and other Democratic campaign groups had a purpose - to help Donald Trump win the election. Well, now NBC News reports that Russian President Vladimir Putin was personally involved in that effort. NBC cites two senior U.S. intelligence officials. NPR has not been able to confirm that story, but our next guest says it makes sense to him. Michael McFaul was U.S. ambassador to Russia from 2012 to 2014, and before that, he was a Russia specialist on the National Security Council. Welcome to the program once again. MICHAEL MCFAUL: Thanks for having me. SIEGEL: And why does this report of Putin's personal involvement in the hacking strike you as at least plausible? MCFAUL: Well, first of all, if this kind of operation was authorized in a democratic government, our own government, there's no question in my mind that the president would have had to sign off on it. But Russia is a one-man system, a one-rule system. Putin controls and makes many micro-decisions. So it's actually implausible to me that he wouldn't have been involved. And the last thing I would remind you of - he is a former KGB agent. He takes special interest in these kinds of operations. SIEGEL: Let's assume that as the CIA claims, the Russians were interested in tipping the election toward Donald Trump. Which do you think would be the more powerful motive in the Kremlin - to elect Trump or to defeat Hillary Clinton? MCFAUL: Both of course. (Laughter) They're not mutually exclusive. So on the one hand, President-elect Trump supports many policies that Vladimir Putin supports. He's hinted that he might recognize Crimea. He's hinted that he might give sanctions... SIEGEL: The Russian annexation of Crimea. MCFAUL: Exactly. He's called into question our NATO alliance. He never talks about democracy and human rights. That's all music to Vladimir Putin's ears. But at the same time, I think it's very important to remember that he did not want to see Hillary Clinton as president. He believes that Secretary of State Clinton, when she was secretary of state, intervened in his elections - the parliamentary elections in 2011 - by calling them not free and fair. And just generally she has less, you know, I would say pro-Russian policies. She was going to be tough on Russia. Trump is not. SIEGEL: Let's say that Putin is pleased with the outcome of our election. What do you think his likely agenda items would be with the - in terms of dealings with the Trump administration? MCFAUL: Well, my guess is that they're delighted that President-elect Trump has made the objective of his foreign policy towards Russia to get along. I think that's a highly flawed way to think about it. But if he wants to just get along, then Vladimir Putin's got some very clear strategies for achieving that. Number one, first and foremost, lift the sanctions. Number two, endorse what we're doing in Syria. Support our war against terrorism, as they would call it, and we'll get along better. Number three, acquiesce to what we've done in Ukraine. And if you do those three things, then, you know, we're - we'll be happy to get along. And I think those are probably the top three agenda items for the Kremlin. SIEGEL: And do you have a sense of what the top agenda items would be for the Trump administration in its dealings with Russia? MCFAUL: I don't, and that's the problem. I think they've confused objectives and means. At least he has, right? You should never have, in my view, a goal of American foreign policy towards any country, Russia or anywhere, to get along. Good relations, and then what, you know? That's not a goal. That's a means. And so far, it's rather mysterious as to what he wants. SIEGEL: Just to return to the hacking story for a moment, NBC cites U.S. intelligence sources for this story as saying that the U.S. has a high level of confidence that Putin was involved. Translate a high level of confidence into English words. What does that mean? MCFAUL: That's the highest they have. Now, they have a scale when I worked in the government of low, medium and high. As an academic, I would like, you know, a little more robust numbers, (laughter) if you will. But that is without question that there's real evidence there. And in my opinion, there is no way people in the CIA would say that to a journalist unless they knew with a lot of confidence that it was true. SIEGEL: Mike McFaul, thanks for talking with us today. MCFAUL: Thank you. SIEGEL: Former U.S. ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul is now a professor of political science at Stanford University. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"December 15, 2016",Labor Secretary Tom Perez Running For DNC Chair," The contest to see who will be the next leader of the Democratic National Committee has just gotten much more interesting — it's also looking a bit like a proxy battle between President Obama and Sen. Bernie Sanders. The latest candidate to enter the race comes firmly from the Obama camp. He is current U.S. Secretary of Labor Tom Perez — a champion of unions and a man considered the most liberal member of Obama's Cabinet. Perez would bring strong organizing chops to the job, and a Hispanic-American at the head of the DNC would send a signal to the fastest-growing demographic group in the party and in the nation as a whole. Speaking on a conference call with state Democratic Party leaders, Perez said, ""Many folks in the field feel ignored by the national party."" He added that the DNC has become ""way too Washington-centric."" Perez says the 50-state strategy implemented more than a decade ago hasn't been the party's approach in recent years. The party needs to build relationships on the ground in every state, he says, and not just come around every four years looking for votes. And he said that if Democrats ignore rural voters, it will be ""at our own peril."" The other most prominent candidate for the post is Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison, a combative progressive and a hero to the party's most liberal wing. Ellison is African-American and in 2006 made history as the first Muslim ever elected to Congress. Ellison got into the race a month ago and has promised to resign his seat in the U.S. House if he wins after a debate emerged over whether the job needed to be full time. It was previously held by Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who split her time between running the DNC and serving in the House. Her tenure ended abruptly in the summer of 2016 after an email hack — which the U.S. intelligence community now believes was carried out by Russia — revealed emails showing that staffers inside the DNC favored Hillary Clinton over Sanders in the 2016 Democratic primary race. Since then the party has been led by Donna Brazile, the former manager of Al Gore's 2000 campaign and a former CNN commentator, who was shown in emails hacked from Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta to have sent questions to the Clinton campaign in advance of a town hall produced by CNN and TV One. Democrats are looking to regroup after a major upset in the 2016 election, not just in the presidential race but farther down the ballot. They failed to take back control of the Senate, which many saw within reach for Democrats, and they picked up a disappointing number of seats in the House. The party is also at its lowest level of power in state capitols across the country in about a century, with just four years to go until redistricting after the 2020 census. Ellison's early entry into the race has given him a head start when it comes to building support and lining up big endorsements. In addition to Sanders, whose unsuccessful presidential bid did succeed at energizing the Democratic Party's progressive wing, there are also Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Rep. John Lewis and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio. The retiring Democratic leader in the Senate, Harry Reid, also supports Ellison. And Ellison has been endorsed by the AFL-CIO, the umbrella organization for most labor unions around the country. Prior to leading the Labor Department, Perez was head of the U.S. Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. He could pick up backing from some individual labor unions around the country, not to mention outgoing Obama administration officials, including the president. His sudden presence in the contest could also cause some Democratic activists to rethink their positions. Unlike some past fights for the DNC leadership, the leading candidates are both from the progressive branch of the party. Both have said they will focus on organizing from the ground up if elected. There are other candidates. South Carolina Democratic Party Chair Jaime Harrison and New Hampshire Democratic Party leader Raymond Buckley are running. Others mulling over jumping into the race are South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Arizona Rep. Ruben Gallego. Former DNC Chairman Howard Dean said he was interested last month but has since withdrawn. All of this still has some 10 weeks to play out. The Democratic National Committee will vote on Feb. 24 in Atlanta to pick its next leader; that will be over a month after President Donald Trump moves into the Oval Office.

npr,"December 15, 2016",N.C. Republicans Move To Limit Powers Of Incoming Democratic Governor," The Republican-controlled North Carolina Legislature has introduced measures to limit the powers of the incoming Democratic governor. Roy Cooper, the state's current attorney general, beat current Republican Gov. Pat McCrory by a slim margin in the November election. McCrory initially refused to concede until a vote recount proved he had lost by about 10,000 votes. On Wednesday, the state Legislature met for a special session called by Republican lawmakers ostensibly to pass a disaster relief bill for Hurricane Matthew. But once the relief bill had been passed, the Legislature moved to introduce a slew of new laws which, if passed, would go to McCrory to sign. The proposed laws strip the incoming governor of powers his predecessor held, including the power to appoint his Cabinet without legislative approval, the power to appoint trustees for the University of North Carolina and the power to oversee the state's election board. The five-member election board — which is currently controlled by the governor, who can appoint up to three members from his or her own party — would be reduced to four members, two from each party. Such a change could have ripple effects, since the state body appoints members to county election boards across the state. Three of North Carolina's county election boards faced a legal challenge in November after they attempted to revoke the voting rights of thousands of registered voters shortly before Election Day. A federal judge blocked the move. Republicans hold large majorities in both chambers of the state Legislature and will continue to do so when the new session begins in January. If McCrory signs the bills, Cooper will wield significantly less power when he takes office. The Charlotte Observer reported on Cooper's response to the 11th-hour changes to the state's executive branch powers: "" 'Major changes in the way state government operates should be done deliberately, with input from all parties, particularly something as important as elections and making sure people have the opportunity to vote,' said Cooper. ... 'They shouldn't be pushed through in the dark of night.' ... "" 'It's time for them to go home,' he said. 'It's time for us to get ready for the long session,' the legislative session that starts next month."" The special session of the Legislature also considered newly proposed bills to increase the maximum class size in North Carolina schools and make changes to a proposed highway project before the new administration takes over.

npr,"December 15, 2016",Facebook Details Its New Plan To Combat Fake News Stories," Providing new details about how it's trying to counter the spread of fake news on its services, Facebook says it's working with fact-checking groups to identify bogus stories — and to warn users if a story they're trying to share has been reported as fake. Facebook also says it will let users report a possible hoax by clicking the upper right hand corner of a post and choosing one of four reasons they want to flag it — from ""It's spam"" to ""It's a fake news story."" If a story is deemed false, it will be tagged with an alert message saying it's been ""disputed by 3rd party fact-checkers.""

 A mockup provided by Facebook shows the screens it will use to allow users to report a potential hoax or fake news story. The social media giant was sharply criticized after the Nov. 8 election, as false stories were blamed for adding confusion to a dynamic campaign season. Since then, fake news and conspiracy theories were also identified as a motivating factor in a man's assault on a pizza restaurant in Washington, D.C. In the wake of that and other stories, some called for Facebook to hire editors to vet news stories; in today's update from Facebook's vice president in charge of its News Feed feature, Adam Mosseri, the company could be seen to be effectively outsourcing that job to third-party groups that it says have signed on to Poynter's International Fact Checking Code of Principles. The update to Facebook's plan to cope with bogus information comes nearly one month after CEO Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged that Facebook had ""much more work"" to do in how it handles false stories. Today's news touches on four of the seven areas that Zuckerberg listed as part of his company's fight against misinformation. It remains to be seen whether the moves will satisfy Facebook's critics — both inside and outside the company's ranks — who've faulted the way it deals with controversial, offensive and/or fake posts. As NPR's Aarti Shahani reported in November, that effort has grown to include thousands of overseas subcontractors. In a news release outlining how Facebook's new reporting and flagging process will work, Mosseri said the company will rely on its users to report a story as potentially bogus, ""along with other signals."" The story would then be sent to fact-checkers. ""If the fact-checking organizations identify a story as fake,"" Mosseri said, ""it will get flagged as disputed and there will be a link to the corresponding article explaining why. Stories that have been disputed may also appear lower in News Feed."" Mosseri added, ""It will still be possible to share these stories, but you will see a warning that the story has been disputed as you share."" The flagged story will also be rejected if anyone tries to turn it into a promoted ad, Facebook says. While fake news created a stir because of its intersection with U.S. politics, many of the people behind the sites say they're mainly in it for the money. Here's how Craig Silverman of BuzzFeed News described what he found in researching the phenomenon, Wednesday's Fresh Air: ""Facebook directly doesn't really earn them a lot of money. But the key thing about Facebook — and this is true whether you're running a politics site out of Macedonia or whether you run a very large website in the U.S. — Facebook is the biggest driver of traffic to, you know, news websites in the world now. You know, 1.8 billion people log into Facebook every month."" Today, Facebook says it has ""found that a lot of fake news is financially motivated"" — and that it's taking steps to remove some of that incentive. ""On the buying side we've eliminated the ability to spoof domains, which will reduce the prevalence of sites that pretend to be real publications,"" Mosseri says. ""On the publisher side, we are analyzing publisher sites to detect where policy enforcement actions might be necessary.""

 President-elect Donald Trump, shown here at a rally in Wisconsin on Tuesday, has a history of using Twitter to lash back at critics. Trump was originally supposed to hold a ""major press conference"" Thursday to reveal how he would address the conflicts of interest, but he decided to postpone it until next month. His staff said dealing with the issue involved complex legal issues and Trump needed time to iron out the details. Although Trump didn't refer to it directly in his tweet, Vanity Fair's website on Tuesday published a rough review of Trump Grill, located in the lobby of Trump Tower in Manhattan. The article, by politics and media writer Tina Nguyen, was headlined, ""Trump Grill could be the worst restaurant in America."" Nguyen lambasted the restaurant for its tacky decor and indifferent menu. Among the foods served, she wrote, was a short-rib burger ""molded into a sad little meat thing, sitting in the center of a massive, rapidly staling brioche bun, hiding its shame under a slice of melted orange cheese. It came with overcooked woody batons called 'fries'—how can someone mess up fries?—and ketchup masquerading as Heinz. If the cheeseburger is a quintessential part of America's identity, Trump's pledge to 'make America great again' suddenly appeared not very promising."" She was no less critical of the way the restaurant looked: ""The restaurant features a stingy number of French-ish paintings that look as though they were bought from Home Goods. Wall-sized mirrors serve to make the place look much bigger than it actually is. The bathrooms transport diners to the experience of desperately searching for toilet paper at a Venezuelan grocery store."" Trump has had a long-running feud with Carter, co-creator of the satirical magazine Spy, which once got under the real estate developer's skin by calling him a ""short-fingered vulgarian."" As Carter explained to NPR's David Folkenflik in March: ""He'll send me pictures, tear sheets from magazines, and he did it as recently as April. With a gold sharpie, he'll circle his fingers and in his handwriting say, see, not so short. And this April when he sent me one, I should have held onto the thing. But I sent it right back by messenger with a note stapled at the top saying, actually, quite short. And I know it just gives him absolute fits. And now that it's become sort of part of the whole campaign rhetoric, I'm sure he wants to just kill me with those — with those little hands."" More recently, the magazine and its editors have regularly lambasted the president-elect. ""Only in America could a man whose staff reportedly took away his Twitter account because he couldn't control himself be given the nuclear codes,"" Carter wrote after the election. Trump has a history of using Twitter to lash out at people he disapproves of, including media figures such as CNN's Jeff Zeleny and Katy Tur of NBC. Joel Kaplan, associate dean for professional graduate studies at Syracuse University's Newhouse School, noted, ""If we have learned nothing else from this election, it is that Trump has a long memory for anyone who has ever slighted him."" Kaplan said members of the media ""have a lot more to worry about"" than Trump's tweets about a top magazine editor. ""Seriously, there is something refreshing about the president of the United States personally going after the media instead of letting his press secretary or vice president do the dirty work,"" Kaplan wrote, in an email to NPR. ""And members of the media should have thick skin; at least skin as thick as the politicians we tend to skewer on a daily basis.""

npr,"December 15, 2016",MAILBAG: Could 'Faithless Electors' Keep Donald Trump Out Of The White House?," Every so often, we answer questions from our politics podcast mailbag online. This week, we answer a question from a listener wondering about so-called ""faithless electors."" I had a question about a Washington Post opinion article written recently by Harvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig. The article states that the Constitution gives the final say to the Electors- who could potentially cast their vote in opposition of their state (on December 19). Lessig says that idea is to have a final preventative measure to stop the people from choosing a catastrophic candidate for president. How far fetched is this idea? — Kate, Washington, D.C. Kate is referring here to this Nov. 24 op-ed from the Washington Post. In it, law professor (and former presidential candidate) Lawrence Lessig doesn't exactly argue against the concept of the Electoral College itself, as many have; in fact, he argues that electors are there as ""a circuit breaker — just in case the people go crazy."" And in 2016, he argues, ""the people did not go crazy"" — he uses the fact that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote (by nearly 3 million votes) as proof. Therefore, he says, the electors should vote her in. In other words, he seems to be arguing that the college itself isn't necessarily bad, but that the electors should vote in proportion with how the population votes. Is this far-fetched? It's far-fetched to think that the electors actually will do such a thing. However, it's not such a crazy idea to say that electors can vote their conscience, according to Richard Primus, who teaches constitutional law at the University of Michigan. He said the Electoral College came about because the founders really did want electors to act as intermediaries between the people and the election of the president. ""The Electoral College made sense to the founders because they were looking for an alternative to having Congress select the president, [and] the idea of a direct popular vote for the president didn't make sense to them,"" he said. ""So they came up with the idea of a special group that would be elected by the states, and in their vision of it the electors were absolutely going to vote their consciences,"" he added. But that has changed. Starting in the 19th century, he says, electors have followed party lines, not necessarily their consciences. ""Our modern system has come to treat the electoral college as a rubber stamp,"" he said. That has tended to work without creating much fuss, he added, because the Electoral College has almost always elected the person who won the popular vote. It's true that sometimes there are wide differences between an Electoral College win and a popular vote win — a small win in the popular vote can sometimes yield a huge Electoral College win, but the winner has usually been the winner. (For more on the history of the Electoral College, see NPR's recent interview with Cokie Roberts on the topic.) Still, right now, the Electoral College is set to elect the candidate who lost the popular vote for the second time in recent history. The below chart shows the percent winning margin in the popular vote versus the percent winning margin in the electoral vote across recent elections. Should some electors decide they want to vote their consciences, they could. Granted, in some states, state law might try to stop them — in 29 states, plus the District of Columbia, electors are bound by law to vote the way the state voted, according to FairVote, a voting rights organization. So by law, only 155 out of 306 Trump electors can change their votes (along with 81 of Clinton's 232). However, the enforcement of these laws hasn't been terribly strict, FairVote also notes, pointing out that electors from some of these ""bound"" states have changed their votes with little consequence: ""Over the years, however, despite legal oversight, a number of electors have violated their state's law binding them to their pledged vote. However, these violators often only face being charged with a misdemeanor or a small fine, usually $1,000."" Indeed, as the U.S. Archives reports, ""No Elector has ever been prosecuted for failing to vote as pledged."" Long story short: The idea that electors could change their votes isn't at all far-fetched. What is far-fetched, as we said in last week's Politics Podcast, is that this could sway the election. One reason is that it's not just a handful that would need to change their votes (or abstain) to change the outcome: Trump would need to lose 37 votes to lose the electoral vote. That doesn't seem likely — only one elector is ""at risk"" of changing his or her vote, as Politico reported this week, based on information from RNC sources. Part of the reason few electors want to change their votes is because they are loyal to their parties. ""Electors generally hold a leadership position in their party or were chosen to recognize years of loyal service to the party,"" the U.S. Archives writes in its explanation of the Electoral College. That tends to mean electors stay in line — as the Archives adds, more than 99 percent of electors over the years have remained true to their states' wishes. There have only been nine ""faithless electors"" in the past century, according to information from FairVote (here is a list of all those electors over time). There is a push to get enough of those electors to vote against Trump — some electors (going by the name ""Hamilton electors"") have tried to swing fellow electors away from Trump and toward someone else, like Ohio Gov. John Kasich. But one problem for them is that Kasich himself has advised Republican electors not to vote for him. So imagine the (unlikely) situation in which Trump loses 37 electors. Then the House would choose from the three candidates who get the most Electoral College votes, with each state delegation getting one vote. There are 33 state delegations that are majority-Republican right now. One could assume they'd want a Republican to win — and having a sizable number of them jeopardize a Republican presidency seems unlikely. And one more thing: While more voters did indeed vote for Clinton, the electors are there to represent their states, not the national popular vote. ""I suspect literally no one voted for electors in November with the goal of empowering them as people to exercise independent judgment,"" said Rob Richie, executive director of FairVote. ""People voting for Trump wanted his associated electors to vote for him. Same with people voting for Clinton. So think expecting them to act against that mandate now is a highly questionable position."" Furthermore, the candidates campaigned under the assumption that the system would work a certain way. If the election were purely based on popular vote, Clinton may have campaigned for more votes in Texas, or Trump may have campaigned more in Republican parts of California. In short: It's not crazy to think that a few electors could vote their conscience. It is, however, a stretch to think that they would sway the election.

npr,"December 15, 2016",7 Questions We Would Have Asked Donald Trump At His Canceled Press Conference," Updated at 12:39 p.m. ET President-elect Donald Trump promised a press conference Thursday to clarify the role he would have with his international business entanglements after he becomes president. He canceled. The transition team said Monday that Trump is delaying his ""announcement"" until January. Later that night, Trump took to his favorite medium to go around the filter — Twitter — and made some news about his plans: Even though I am not mandated by law to do so, I will be leaving my busineses before January 20th so that I can focus full time on the...... Presidency. Two of my children, Don and Eric, plus executives, will manage them. No new deals will be done during my term(s) in office. But we have questions related to his businesses — and otherwise. Here's what six of our top reporters and correspondents, who cover business, politics and the White House, would have asked — and would welcome answers to. — Domenico Montanaro, political editor 1. Why did your daughter sit in on a meeting with the Japanese prime minister, and did she discuss any business during the meeting? Context: This happened at a time when Ivanka Trump was closing a deal with a Japanese clothing company that has the Japanese government as a shareholder. The Trump transition team didn't release any pictures of the meeting, but they appeared later on social media in Japan. Ivanka Trump sat in on her father's meeting today with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, per handout photo pic.twitter.com/tEbfYYeJFA 2. Last month you had a phone call with the Argentine president. Is there any truth to the report that you spoke about stalled permits for a construction project you're building in Buenos Aires? What is the status of the project now? Context: There was a report a few days after the call that the project, which was stalled for a while, had restarted. There was also the initial report from a respected Argentine journalist that Trump discussed the project with Argentine President Mauricio Macri, whose office denied the report. 3. Once the separation is complete, are there things you'll discuss with Ivanka that you won't discuss with Donald Jr. and Eric? And are there things your sons won't discuss with you and their sister? Context: All three children have been involved in running the Trump Organization, and all three have played a role in the Trump transition. In fact, all three were photographed in a meeting of tech leaders Wednesday. While ethics watchdogs say nothing short of liquidation would resolve the potential for conflicts of interest, I'm trying to understand what kind of firewall Trump envisions erecting within his family. Look who’s sitting at the head of the table in Trump’s official meeting with tech CEO’s: Don Jr., Ivanka Trump and Eric Trump. pic.twitter.com/xUYo3QL0g7 4. Why are you skeptical of the consensus of all 17 U.S. intelligence agencies, that Russia interfered with the 2016 election process? You have repeatedly said that U.S. intelligence ""has no idea"" who hacked U.S. institutions. You have access to the classified evidence that supports the intelligence assessment. Do you possess evidence to the contrary? Context: In a joint statement, released Oct. 7, the 17 agencies said (boldface is ours): ""The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations. The recent disclosures of alleged hacked e-mails on sites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process. Such activity is not new to Moscow—the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there. We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities."" A leaked CIA analysis concluded that it was done in an effort to hurt Hillary Clinton and try to get Donald Trump elected. An NBC News report went further, saying the CIA had ""high confidence"" that Russian President Vladimir Putin ""became personally involved in the covert Russian campaign to interfere in the U.S. presidential election,"" stemming from a ""vendetta"" against Clinton because of comments she made in 2011 questioning the legitimacy of the Russian elections. 5. The Carrier company is using the $16.5 million investment in the Indiana plant to automate it, which will lead to more layoffs in the future. Do you have a plan to stop the job-killing effects of automation? Context: The head of United Technologies, Greg Hayes, told CNBC's Jim Cramer the following: ""We're going to make a $16 million investment in that factory in Indianapolis to automate to drive the cost down so that we can continue to be competitive. Now, is it as cheap as moving to Mexico with lower cost of labor? No. But we will make that plant competitive just because we'll make the capital investments there. What that ultimately means is there will be fewer jobs."" As the local Indianapolis ABC affiliate noted: ""Trump's deal will keep 730 union, production line jobs as well as 70 salaried positions in Indianapolis in exchange for $7 million in tax incentives over the next 10 years."" 6. Your former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, said recently the problem with the media is that they took the things you said too literally. Do you want the American people to take what you say and tweet literally? How can the American people judge whether you are being truthful if your own aides say you shouldn't necessarily be taken literally? Context: Earlier this month, during a panel discussion at the Harvard Institute of Politics, the former Trump campaign manager said, ""This is the problem with the media — you guys took everything Donald Trump said so literally. And the problem with that is the American people didn't. They understood that sometimes when you have a conversation with people, you're going to say something, and maybe you don't have all the facts to back that up, but that's how the American people live."" Trump has repeatedly said and tweeted things that are simply not true. He also made promises on the campaign trail that he has backed away from, like saying Hillary Clinton would be locked up if he were president or that he would call for a temporary ban of Muslims coming into the United States. Lewandowski, who has been seen coming and going from Trump Tower during the transition, implied it was a mistake for journalists to focus on these things. The president-elect's view on this could be revealing. 7. Mr. President-elect, you have said repeatedly in speeches during your thank-you tour that you will bring the U.S. together — that we're one country, and we need to be united. But at those same speeches, talk of unity is combined with statements that criticize, even mock those who opposed you. How does that serve the unity you say needs to come about? And can you please list some specific examples of things you will do to help that unity take place? Context: I'd ask this question for several reasons. His call for unity is absolutely at odds with much of his post-election rhetoric so far. While it's true that, at times, Trump seems to lack ideology — many voters told me this year that they see him as neither a Republican nor a Democrat — he, so far, has done very little to reassure or reach out to voters and elected officials who opposed him. He has boasted of his victory at rallies, while reliving his margins state by state. He has claimed falsely to have won one of the biggest Electoral College landslides ever. And he has said he only lost the popular vote because of millions of people voting illegally for his opponent. He has also named a very conservative Cabinet with an unprecedented number of billionaires and millionaires. The closest he has come to reaching out would be some of the meetings he has held at Trump Tower, including with Mitt Romney, who was eventually rejected as a secretary of state nominee, and former Vice President Al Gore, who told reporters he had an ""extremely interesting"" discussion with Trump on climate change. Just days after the Gore meeting, Trump, who has called climate change a ""hoax,"" named Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt to head the Environmental Protection Agency. Pruitt is a climate-change skeptic who has, in the past, sued the EPA over its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power plants.

npr,"December 15, 2016",York Voter Hopes Donald Trump Will Run The Country Like A Business," DON GETTYS: You're an elected official, and it's a fee-basis. You get paid for what you do. If you don't do any work, you don't make any money, so you're not a burden on the taxpayers that don't do anything. If you go out and hustle and serve warrants, subpoenas and transport prisoners or whatever for the judges, you get paid accordingly. INSKEEP: Don Gettys is 74, a retired police officer. Back in 2008, he recounted his own modest upbringing. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) GETTYS: I can't recall any privilege that I got because I was white. I mean, I went to city schools. But I don't know of anything that - that I got that the black kids couldn't have gotten the same thing. INSKEEP: Don Gettys grew up in York, which is an old manufacturing town, far from the big, urban centers of Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. The city has been through some hard times over the years, but when we talked again in 2016, Gettys says... GETTYS: All in all, York's a great place to live. There's new businesses downtown. They're trying to get more people downtown. And, you know, I think there's been a lot of improvements. INSKEEP: Well, that's good to hear, considering that there's been some pretty hard times in the country the last eight years. The recession was just starting when we last spoke back in 2008. GETTYS: Yeah. INSKEEP: So I'm recalling that, eight years ago, you voted for John McCain for president. GETTYS: I did. INSKEEP: Obama was not your guy. GETTYS: No. INSKEEP: How do you think he's done? GETTYS: There's things he's done that I think have helped, and there's things that I don't agree with. INSKEEP: Really? What's something you'd put in each category - you agree with and disagree with? GETTYS: Well, you know, one thing - a lot of people don't agree with it, but I think opening up relations with Cuba - I think that's one of the good things. I don't like some of the immigration that's going on. These people are coming into this country right and left. They give them a date to come back for immigration court, and they disappear. They never - you know... INSKEEP: I guess we should note, for the record, net migration is actually down, for the most part, in recent years. But there are a lot of people who are here without documents. Does that affect you personally? GETTYS: I can't say it does in York. I mean, there's a lot of Hispanics in the York area, but, you know, a lot of them are here working. They're - they're here legally. INSKEEP: It's interesting listening to you. It sounds like illegal immigration is a thing that doesn't really affect you, but it just - there's something about it that just bugs you. GETTYS: Well, I had a personal experience years ago. My son was in the Marine Corps, and he was out in California. He was driving down I-5, and an illegal Mexican ran into him, demolished his car. He ended up in the hospital and, you know, he lost everything. This guy shouldn't even have been in the country, but he was there and was drunk and hit him. INSKEEP: Oh, the guy didn't have insurance? GETTYS: No (laughter). He didn't have a driver's license, insurance, didn't have anything. INSKEEP: And your son didn't have insurance that would cover that situation either? GETTYS: He did, but why should his insurance company take a beating for an illegal? I mean, that - that doesn't make sense. INSKEEP: That's Don Gettys of York, Pa., one of the voters we gathered eight years ago and again this week to talk about race. Getty's voted for Donald Trump this fall. And since he's in Pennsylvania, it's one of the votes that decided the election. Are you excited about a President Trump? GETTYS: Yeah. Yeah, I think he's got a good business sense, and you've sort of got to run this country like a business. And I just hope he gets the country back together and gets rid of the divisiveness and get everybody on the same page. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"December 15, 2016","While Trump Won York County, Pa., Republican Cal Weary Backed Clinton"," We're just across from the Central Market House, this huge Victorian brick building with green wooden doors and Christmas wreaths. And here we are at the Pennsylvania Arts Experience. And here's our man. Hey there. CAL WEARY: Hey, how are you doing? INSKEEP: Great, good to see you. WEARY: Good to see you. Sorry, I'm... INSKEEP: It's OK. Just go ahead. Don't mind us. Cal Weary was on the phone when we arrived and gestured us in out of the cold. He looked about the same as in 2008. Back then, he was 34, a high school performing arts teacher. Today, he's in a different job running this private gallery and performing arts space. When we visited, his 15-year-old son was using one room to practice. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""WHEN I'M ALONE"") ELI ZACHEUS: (Singing) Tell me you love me. Tell me you need me. INSKEEP: He's one of Weary's three kids, all of them mixed race. Cal Weary is black. His wife is white. The last time we met, he suggested that Obama's election might encourage greater acceptance of people like him. WEARY: It opens it up to it being all right, to that melting, that changing, where people are like, well, he's the president, so that's all right for my daughter to date a black guy, and that's all right for us to cross these other lines. INSKEEP: He was a registered Republican who crossed party lines to vote for Obama. At the same time, Weary asserted back in 2008 any black advance causes some white people to feel like something is torn away from them. Today, at age 42, Cal Weary showed us paintings people have hung on the wall of the gallery. WEARY: Yeah, you got to take a look at that one. INSKEEP: That is a painting of... WEARY: It's intense. INSKEEP: ...Hundreds of people in what look like Klan hoods. WEARY: Yes. INSKEEP: We moved a little closer to the print. Oh, I'm seeing someone speaking to all the Klan hoods with familiar-looking hair. WEARY: Yes. INSKEEP: Is this what I think it is? WEARY: Oh, it's definitely what do you think it is. INSKEEP: So this is Donald Trump addressing a Klan rally. WEARY: Donald Trump addressing many of his constituents. INSKEEP: Now, York County voted for Donald Trump, and Cal Weary has seen people walk past that painting and cringe. WEARY: They are trying to block out the fact that they have an affiliation with some people who they would never affiliate with in their homes, in their social circles. INSKEEP: He means an affiliation with white supremacists who passionately backed the Republican even if other Trump voters did not feel they were racist. Do you think that people who voted for Trump are enabling racism? WEARY: I think that they definitely are saying that it's not that big a deal to them. And so in that case, yes. You know, yeah, there's some racism there, but hasn't there always been? These are the kind of things you hear. INSKEEP: And Cal Weary does hear them because his mixed-race family includes people who voted for Donald Trump. WEARY: And one of my close family members that I love dearly, that I spend time with, made a comment about how voting for Donald Trump was going to make America a better place for his kids. And he's right. By what is being said, it will make things better for his... INSKEEP: White kids. WEARY: His white kids. But for his biracial nephew and nieces, how does that fare for them? INSKEEP: Well, what is this election going to do for your kids? WEARY: I don't necessarily see where the benefits lie for them. INSKEEP: To be clear, President-elect Trump has promised more jobs for African-Americans. But Trump's questioning of Obama's birth certificate, his talk about illegal immigrants and other people of color left Weary deeply uncertain about the views of people who would support Trump. WEARY: The worst thing for me after the election, I grew up - predominantly white school. I mean, I was, like, the only black kid there for a number of years. But I never really felt myself walking around always wondering in most places if this white person was racist against me or if that one was. And the day after that election - and I kind of hate myself a little bit for it - every time I would come across, especially middle-age to elderly white male, I kind of just wondered. INSKEEP: It's an especially strange feeling for Cal Weary because of his Republican views. He voted for Hillary Clinton this time. Yet, he thinks the country was ready for a shift away from President Obama. WEARY: It actually made sense for what - it sounds crazy for me to say it, but what happened made sense. If it would have gone the other way, it wouldn't have made sense. INSKEEP: Maybe Cal Weary is philosophical because of his health. Shortly before the election, he suffered a heart attack. He's feeling much better now, but he's come to see that event as a metaphor. WEARY: You could kind of look at what just happened to us was like a heart attack. It was like we were all breathing really hard to see what would happen and then it happened. And even the people who were for it happening were kind of taken aback. Then you always have the guy who said I saw you eating those cheese curds for years. I knew you were going to have a heart attack. And now we've got an answer that came back to us. And it's (imitating heart beat) that heart attack just happened. So now we're at a point of, I mean, do we have another one or do we start therapy? (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""WHEN I'M ALONE"") ZACHEUS: (Singing) I'm not the man I was. I'm not the man I was anymore. INSKEEP: Cal Weary runs a performing arts space in York, Pa.

npr,"December 15, 2016","Like Perry, Ex-Chief Abraham Made Moves To End Energy Department"," SPENCER ABRAHAM: He's got a military background, and he comes from a state that has a huge, diverse energy portfolio. GREENE: That's former Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham. He worked under President George W. Bush and has something in common with Rick Perry. Before being chosen to lead the Energy Department, he had called for the Energy Department to be abolished. For Abraham, that was back when he was a U.S. senator from Michigan. ABRAHAM: I did obviously have to tell employees, the department, that I was committed and, you know, wanted to work with them and build a trust. GREENE: You had a credibility problem that you had to get over. ABRAHAM: Yeah, yeah. And, I mean, I think we did OK on that. I'm - you know, I can't be the judge of that. But I thought that it's certainly surmountable and obviously he'll have to figure out how he wants to characterize things. GREENE: Now, Rick Perry has also worried some people because he is a climate change skeptic. We raised that issue with Spencer Abraham, beginning with this question. Do you believe in climate change, that the science is settled? ABRAHAM: I actually have worked on the boards of companies that are active in addressing a lot of the climate change issues. At this point, no one has the categorical answer to the question of how fast the climate's changing and when we're going to face consequences from that. GREENE: I just - I just want to be really, really careful with this because a lot of people would hear what you were saying and they would say that you don't believe the science is settled, that you might be denying that climate change is (unintelligible). ABRAHAM: Well, that's - you know, I think that's the problem right now, to be honest with you. I think that's the problem because if people say we don't have total information, they suddenly become treated as climate deniers. GREENE: I mean, there are a lot of people out there who feel the science is absolutely settled, that humans are causing the climate to change. I mean, do you - even though there are a lot of questions to be answered as time goes on, do you believe that that is the case? ABRAHAM: I believe that the climate is changing. I believe that it is likely that humans are playing a role in that. How fast it's changing is the main issue I think that we have to deduce now. And in the meantime, I think moving forward with nuclear energy, renewable energy, energy efficiency and more natural gas are all ways that we're going to change the energy mix in a positive direction. GREENE: Mr. Secretary, it sounds like some of the very questions I'm asking you have been asked by the Trump transition team in a questionnaire that was circulated at the Department of Energy asking for the names of people who have been involved in climate change programs, people who've gone to conferences. I spoke to a former colleague of yours from President George W. Bush's administration, Christine Todd Whitman who ran the EPA at the time. I asked her about this questionnaire, and here's what she said. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) CHRISTINE TODD WHITMAN: If I were a federal employee, I'd be very nervous about it. Why? Why would you need to know that? If they are a career civil servant that's carrying out the policies of the incumbent administration, why do you need to know that they've been good civil servants for this one issue? GREENE: It sounds like she's saying that civil servants in the department should be nervous if the incoming president is... ABRAHAM: Yeah, I don't know - I don't see why they need to be because it seems to me it's perfectly typical for the new administration to want to know what the current people working in a department are doing. And the idea that that shouldn't be provided is, first of all, I think, silly. And second, the people who are career people shouldn't be worried. They're career people. They can't be, you know, punished for what they've done in a previous administration. I can't imagine that will happen. GREENE: Couldn't they be fired by the Trump administration if... ABRAHAM: Well, they're not political appointees. GREENE: And there's no way that a civil servant scientist could be pressured or fired if the Trump administration believes that... ABRAHAM: I'm not going to speculate on some - I mean, look, if you're going to take that kind of approach that that's the immediate supposition, I mean, you know, you're taking it to the extreme. GREENE: Is it normal practice? I mean, did you do that? Did the the Bush transition team do this when you were coming in and starting at the department? ABRAHAM: Well, first of all, it changes when there's actually a designated person to serve in the Cabinet. And I think whatever happened before Rick Perry's announcement is, you know, sort of prologue. Again, I'm not saying that, you know, somebody couldn't read into it what you're reading into it. But at the same time, I think you could read into it simply that there's an effort to try to find out who's working on what and how much time has been devoted to the various priorities of the department. GREENE: All right, Spencer Abraham, always great talking to you. Thank you so much. ABRAHAM: Thanks, yep. GREENE: That is former Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham. We should say the Trump transition team has walked away from that effort to identify people who have worked on climate change. The Energy Department had already declined to share any names.

npr,"December 15, 2016","York Voter, Who Supported Obama, Is In Disbelief About 2016's Election"," (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) MARGIE ORR: Can I - can I - this is Margie. And I don't see your nametag. INSKEEP: That was Margie Orr, who's black. She described how, as a young person, her family had moved into an all-white neighborhood. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) ORR: We weren't wanted there, of course, and the whites did everything they could to intimidate us, to get us to move. But my parents were staunch-hearted people. We weren't going to budge. INSKEEP: That memory was on her mind as she voted for Barack Obama in 2008. After Obama's victory, we met our group again. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) ORR: When it flashed on the screen that he had indeed won, I mean, the joy, the jubilation just made you feel like there's nothing wrong with the United States. INSKEEP: So that was Margie Orr after the 2008 election. This is Margie Orr after the 2016 election. ORR: I'm still in disbelief. I'm in total disbelief - total disbelief. INSKEEP: Margie Orr is 1 of 4 York, Pa., voters we're visiting again. All their roles have reversed. Those who were happy then are not now. To be honest, Margie Orr was never entirely satisfied during Obama's years. ORR: Obama has had a rough time of it with the other party coming into office. I mean, he's - he's tried his best. With him being who he is, I think he's been an excellent president, a very good, excellent role model. INSKEEP: You said you supported him in part because he was African-American. Do you think he was opposed, at least in part, also because he was black? ORR: Yes, most definitely. The country wasn't prepared to have a black president. Mindboggling to me because, I mean, he's half of everybody. INSKEEP: You raise an interesting point - that he had a white mother, that he felt that he had close touch with Scots-Irish ancestors as well as with African ancestors. ORR: Right, right. And there's the fact that his white grandparents even raised him, but not negating the fact, though, he's still black. And there lies the problem. There lied the problem. INSKEEP: Margie Orr campaigned for Hillary Clinton this time around. Now that her candidate has lost, she looks at the future with grim resignation. ORR: We as black people, we know how to survive. Good or bad, you know, I'll live on. If there's ways that I can help, I'm going to continue to do whatever I can for our children. INSKEEP: Here's what she means by our children - when we first met eight years ago, Margie Orr was working as a receptionist. Today, she's retired from that job but has gone on to something new. She was elected to the York, Pa., school board and is now its president, where she sees her job as... ORR: Protecting all of my children, and I refer to them as my children because they are. INSKEEP: It's a majority-minority student body - nearly all black and Latino kids. Whatever the results of this year's election, the country continues to change. Copyright © 2016 NPR.

npr,"December 15, 2016",How Have Trump's Comments On China Policy Been Received In Taiwan?," WENDY SHERMAN: Good to be with you, David. GREENE: So what's the reaction to these comments from Trump in Taiwan? SHERMAN: Well, as you can imagine, when I planned this trip, I didn't expect to be in the middle of such a discussion. But what's really important here, David, is, as you said in your introduction, this is a policy that has been in place for decades - Republican and Democratic presidents. And I think the real fundamental issue here is why would we bargain away such a close partner? It's sort of ridiculous when you think about it. GREENE: Well, you say bargain away. I mean, it sounds like Donald Trump's argument is that this might be a way to have leverage over China and maybe sending a message that, you know, we could put pressure on you as well. Is there any argument for that at all? SHERMAN: I actually don't think so in this case. If you're looking for leverage, this is not the place to look for it. You don't say to Taiwan we are going to use you to extract something from China. Taiwan has its interests and its balance with the mainland. And who are we to decide to upset that apple cart? GREENE: If the apple cart is upset, what would that look like? SHERMAN: Well, there's no doubt in my mind that the first casualty of such an approach will be Taiwan because China and the mainland will take out its retaliation first in Taiwan because it is seen as, by China, as part of China. GREENE: In what way? What would retaliation look like? SHERMAN: Well, that retaliation could be economic. About 40 percent of Taiwan's economy is dependent on the mainland. So they could send deals elsewhere. They could also take kinds of military action that might not start a war but would be provocative. GREENE: What might happen beyond that? You said that might be the first reaction. SHERMAN: Well, I think it could go far beyond that in things they could do to us. There's a report out this morning that China has said that a U.S. auto company is going to be facing some fines for monopolistic behavior. I think that is an effort that has been going on for some time. But I think there is a coincidence of timing. So I think China's got a lot of cards to play. And I'm not sure why we'd go down this particular road. GREENE: Well, what would you tell Donald Trump's supporters who heard his message that he would get tough on China, that it's not a balanced relationship and that he was going to really shake things up? They are watching this, and they're liking what they're seeing. SHERMAN: Well, what I would say is make sure you know where you're heading. What are steps two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10? When you do international relations, this is not like building leverage to do a real estate development deal. If that building doesn't get built, then that building doesn't get built, and people go live somewhere else. If you blow up an international understanding of long-standing, you may find yourself at war. GREENE: OK. Ambassador Sherman, thanks so much for joining us. We really appreciate the time. SHERMAN: Thank you. GREENE: That was Ambassador Wendy Sherman speaking to us from Taiwan. She is a former U.S. under secretary of state for political affairs. Copyright © 2016 NPR.

npr,"December 15, 2016","Putin Personally Involved In U.S. Election Hack, NBC News Reports"," NBC News is alone on this story, at this point. Let's hear from one person involved in the reporting. Journalist William Arkin is on the line. Good morning. WILLIAM ARKIN: Good morning. GREENE: So what exactly are your sources telling you? How was Putin involved here? ARKIN: Well, we've been reporting on this story since before October when the director of national intelligence and the Department of Homeland Security officially made an announcement that they believe that senior-level Russian officials had been involved in the hack of the Democratic National Campaign Committee and the Democratic National Committee. GREENE: This is pretty senior, it sounds like you're saying now (laughter). ARKIN: (Laughter) Well, we have been trying to understand what the Russians did. And - and here's how I would break it down. We went from understanding that Russians were involved in the hacking of the U.S. political system at - on many fronts to the Russians were involved in the hacking, meaning somebody associated with the government... GREENE: Right. ARKIN: ...To the Kremlin was involved in the hacking to now that Putin himself, once the material had been hacked, directed the overall campaign to interfere in the American election. GREENE: Actually directed it himself - and, I mean, I know - and the intelligence community is so careful with language. They're saying high-level of confidence. What does that mean? ARKIN: Well, it generally means that they - well, as they say, we would take it to the bank. But since we've been reporting on this for quite some time now, we have developed sources from throughout the intelligence community and from within the military and the diplomatic world as well. So we're not just relying upon the CIA, who I would remind the - the listeners have been playing a bit of a game since Friday, which I think is more associated with undermining Trump than it is to necessarily reveal the truth to the American people. GREENE: Right, and sadly we don't have time to get into a back and forth over the motives of the CIA. But let me just ask you, I mean, it's - if you're talking about Vladimir Putin himself, you would imagine that Western spy agencies would have had to literally break into his inner circle. If they've achieved that, why on Earth would they want to show their hand and reveal this to you? ARKIN: Well, I can also say that the intelligence community asked us not to name how we knew this or what our sources were. So they're not happy with the fact that we did this report last night on NBC. But I think that the line of reasoning, of understanding what happened here - information was stolen first. Then, the Russians decide to, if you will, weaponize that information against the United States to undermine the United States. The fact that Donald Trump was elected, I think, was probably something that surpassed their wildest dreams. But still, we need to separate out those pieces of it. What did the Russians do? What did they actually get involved in? And what were their actual objectives? And now that we know that Putin was involved, I think we get closer to understanding what the Russians were trying to achieve. GREENE: OK, we just have a couple of seconds left here. Do you worry about putting people at risk? Did you talk about whether you might be putting some of, you know, spies at risk here? ARKIN: We did have that deliberation inside NBC. And I'm a longtime reporter in this field. And we did take the U.S. government's concerns seriously. But we thought that it was important to try to substantiate why it was that the United States felt with high confidence that Putin... GREENE: All right. ARKIN: ...Was personally involved. GREENE: OK, William Arkin's a journalist with NBC. Thanks so much for joining us this morning. ARKIN: Thank you for having me on. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"December 15, 2016","York Voter, Who Backed McCain In 2008, Hesitated To Vote For Trump"," What do we think these are, houses maybe from the '90s? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: They look recent, yeah. INSKEEP: Playground sets out back. We stopped at a house near the end of a cul de sac. This is just gorgeous, the pond out back surrounded by a white fence. And we said hello once again to Sarah Yacoviello. SARAH YACOVIELLO: Hi. INSKEEP: Oh, my goodness, hi. YACOVIELLO: Hey, Steve, how are you? INSKEEP: Good to see you. She's 39 years old now, a mother of two. Molly curled up on the chair arm next to her mom, while Vincent played Christmas songs on the piano. (SOUNDBITE OF PIANO) INSKEEP: The last time we met in 2008, Vincent wasn't born. That was in the aftermath of Barack Obama's historic election. Sarah Yacoviello had voted for Republican John McCain. And here's what she said back then. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) YACOVIELLO: I'm sad. In another regard, I have this dichotomy that I can't reconcile in my mind. I feel like there's a social justice that has been won here with electing a black president. But I also feel the social injustice of abortion. I'm still grieved and burdened with the thought of the social injustices that are still present and may grow stronger in the next four years. INSKEEP: Eight years later, we settled in by the Christmas tree and the fire to talk. Her husband Rob kept track of the well-behaved dog. Sarah said she's grown to like President Obama. YACOVIELLO: I'm proud to be an American when I look at him. I'm - he's a good man. He was a good husband. He was a good father, a statesman, a good spokesman for our country. And it's hard as a conservative to say these things, but I really do have a great deal of respect for him. INSKEEP: Sarah Yacoviello is white and she's thought a lot about race during Obama's years when race was often in the news. As a Christian, she's come to support the Black Lives Matter movement of recent years against police violence. YACOVIELLO: I think how dare anybody contradict that by saying all lives matter because unless black lives matter, all lives don't matter. I think race and the issues with race in our country are very important. And that's part of the reason that this election was hard for me. INSKEEP: Hard because for Sarah Yacoviello race was not the only issue. She works these days in fundraising for nonprofits. That work brings her in contact with affluent businesspeople. And those meetings influenced her final agonizing choice in 2016 to vote for Donald Trump. She's comfortable if Trump approves tax breaks and reduced regulations for business owners. YACOVIELLO: The working class needs them and our country needs them. INSKEEP: I've heard critics of Trump say he's just going to help the wealthy. YACOVIELLO: Yeah. INSKEEP: But you're actually saying, I think he is going to help wealthy people and that's OK. YACOVIELLO: Because I think by helping the wealthy, he's also helping me, us, the middle class, the poor. I think those jobs are important and that philanthropy is important. INSKEEP: Her late decision to vote for Trump proved to be one of the votes that made the difference in this closely divided and vital state. YACOVIELLO: That whole week I felt so much angst. I felt like I did the right thing personally. I came to that decision. And then I told Rob I just need to do what I think is right and I'm not going to tell anybody. I'm not thrilled about it but I just need to do this for the future of our country. INSKEEP: Do you see the president-elect as a role model? YACOVIELLO: No, I don't. INSKEEP: Why not? YACOVIELLO: I don't want to have to defend him as a man. I really don't because I don't know if I can. In some ways it's refreshing that he's not a typical politician, but in other ways his reactionary personality and his inflammatory speech is something that I don't want my children to feel that they are able to do. INSKEEP: How are you going to avoid that? YACOVIELLO: Well I - I'm hopeful that he'll become more presidential as he obtains the office in January. I'm hoping that he's going to surround himself with people who will help him speak wisely and carefully. INSKEEP: Her reservations about Trump explain why she hasn't told anyone outside her family how she voted - until now. YACOVIELLO: My best friend voted for Hillary. I don't fault her for that. I mean, she believes with all her heart that Hillary would've been best. And I believe with my heart that a conservative candidate would have been best. And I feel like what's missing there and what is important and why I decided I would reveal who I voted for is the communication factor. Each different position is coming from a side of love. So let's take the pro-life, pro-choice movement. A lot of pro-choice advocates will say that pro-life people are unloving, but really they do care deeply for the unborn child. But I don't think pro-choice advocates are unloving, either. They care deeply, for you know, the woman who might be hurt, who might be making a horrible - you know, a very tough decision. And I feel like if we saw these perspectives from walking in somebody else's shoes, it would be a lot more peaceful. That each of us is - at least my friends, I know there are some very, very hateful, extreme people in the world. I mean, we saw that right after the election. But from my personal experience, I feel that both sides are coming from a point of love. INSKEEP: How do you feel about the fact that some of those hateful and extreme people - big Trump supporters? YACOVIELLO: Yeah. It makes... INSKEEP: White supremacists. YACOVIELLO: I know. I feel like those people are going to come out and they're going to latch onto and I feel like it's despicable. And it needs to be called out. And I'm ashamed that they supported the same candidate that I do. And I think there's hate on both sides. I really do. The week of the election I couldn't say - I had to get off social media. I mean, because there was such hate being spewed towards people who might have voted for Trump. And I couldn't say a word because I felt, you know, am I a bad person? And I thought, no, I made this decision. INSKEEP: Sarah Yacoviello, one of the York, Pa., voters we met in 2008 and are revisiting this week. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"December 15, 2016",President-Elect Trump Breaks With Long History Of Press Conferences," Donald Trump speaks during a news conference at Trump National Doral on July 27 in Doral, Fla. That was his last press conference. Why are we tracking this? Unlike other ways of getting messages out, press conferences hold public officials more accountable to the American people because they have to answer questions in an uncontrolled environment. ""The public expects that a president isn't just going to announce something [but] that he's going to explain it and be able to answer questions about it,"" said Martha Joynt Kumar, a political scientist at Towson University and director of the White House Transition Project. For the second time as president-elect, Trump tweeted an announcement of a scheduled press conference, this time on Jan. 11. I will be having a general news conference on JANUARY ELEVENTH in N.Y.C. Thank you. Initially, Dec. 15 was to be the day Trump would hold his first press conference since winning the election. But it never happened, canceled before a time and place had been set. It was supposed to be about how Trump would address his potential business conflicts of interest as president. The rescheduled press conference has no such promised focus. Already, no president-elect (dating to at least Jimmy Carter) has waited longer to hold a press conference. One irony — perhaps hypocrisy — of Trump's extended run without a press conference is just how critical he and his campaign were of rival Hillary Clinton's choice to go an extended period (276 days in total) without holding one. His campaign sent out daily press releases counting the days since her last press conference, headlined, ""Hiding Hillary Watch"" — and, at one point, Trump even tweeted about it: I am getting great credit for my press conference today. Crooked Hillary should be admonished for not having a press conference in 179 days. Unless Trump holds a press conference by Jan. 21, one day after his inauguration, he will hit the very mark for which he ridiculed Clinton on Twitter. Precedent favors frequent press conferences during transition

 George W. Bush holds a press conference Dec. 17, 2000, where he named Alberto Gonzales chief White House lawyer, Condoleezza Rice (next to Bush) national security adviser and Karen Hughes (far right) counselor. Two days after the Supreme Court decision that made George W. Bush president-elect in 2000, he held a press conference in Austin. He took questions from reporters about his potential Cabinet picks, whether he would call for tax cuts and when the weight of being the next president of the United States hit him. The next day, Bush introduced his choice for secretary of state and took more questions. The day after that, he answered yet more questions during a press conference to introduce his national security adviser and White House counselors. President-elect Barack Obama followed a similar pattern, regularly fielding questions from reporters, as he made choices about who would serve in his administration. In all, Obama fielded questions from the White House press corps on 18 different occasions as president-elect. George W. Bush, who had a shorter transition period, did so 11 times. At this point, if president-elect Donald Trump were to hold a press conference every day starting today, he wouldn't hit Obama's mark for formal interactions with the press during the transition period. As with so many other things, Trump is flouting this tradition. He hasn't held a press conference since July 27, when he called on Russia to hack Hillary Clinton's emails. ""I will tell you this, Russia: If you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,"" Trump said at his resort in Doral, Fla. ""I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.""

 President-elect Donald Trump and Kanye West pose for a picture Tuesday in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York. Instead Trump has opted for rallies, press releases, photo ops, a handful of interviews and tweeting. Lots of tweeting. On the day he announced his choice for secretary of state, Trump tweeted praise for his pick, Rex Tillerson, the chairman and CEO of Exxon Mobil, but didn't appear with him publicly. Trump did go down to the lobby of Trump Tower so he could be photographed with rapper Kanye West. ""Life,"" Trump said when asked what they talked about. ""We discussed life."" Later, he held a victory rally in Wisconsin. The first presidential press conference happened by accident When an aide to President Woodrow Wilson invited newspapermen to meet the new president in 1913, the presidential press conference was born. He wasn't expecting so many newsmen to show up. But since then, it has become a tradition, a fixture of the relationship between the president, the press and, by extension, the American public. Based on an NPR analysis of data from the American Presidency Project at the University of California, Santa Barbara over the past three administrations, the president has fielded questions from reporters on average about every 15 days. CBS News White House correspondent Mark Knoller, who meticulously tracks the activities of the president, says the longest drought between press conferences for President George W. Bush was 82 days, while the longest President Obama went without a press conference was 86. But the traditions of the relationship between the president and the press don't appear to be a driving motivator for Trump and his transition team. Appearing on the Hugh Hewitt radio show, Trump's future White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, said things like the weekly radio address, or even the daily briefing by the press secretary — where members of the media are allowed to question the administration on policy and topics of the day — could change under Trump. ""The traditions, while some of them are great,"" Priebus said, ""I think it's time to revisit a lot of these things that have been done in the White House, and I can assure you that change is going to happen.""

npr,"December 14, 2016",'Politically Correct': The Phrase Has Gone From Wisdom To Weapon," Now president-elect, Trump has denounced ""political correctness"" many, many, times since his campaign began. At a rally a year ago in South Carolina, he called for a ""total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States."" He told a cheering crowd that his statement on the subject was ""very, very salient, very important and probably not politically correct."" Politically correct. Political correctness. Using the biggest bully pulpit there is, Trump has wielded the phrase and its variants like a club some days and a shield on others. And he's hardly alone. Since as far back as 1793, when the term appeared in a U.S. Supreme Court decision about the boundaries of federal jurisdiction, ""politically correct"" has had an array of definitions. It has been used to describe what is politically wise, and it has been employed as ironic self-mockery. The phrase has driven contentious debates in which free speech and free choice are pitted against civility and inclusion. But it hasn't just changed meaning, it has changed targets. What the November election has made clear is that these words, especially when they're related to matters of multiculturalism and diversity, carry consequences. Fairleigh Dickinson University and the Pew Research Center released two polls in the past year, each finding that, like Trump, a majority of Americans thought people were too easily offended and that ""political correctness"" was one of the country's biggest problems. But what exactly is it? People of all political stripes have used the phrase with varying, even contradictory meanings. In 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson used it to simply describe the correct (and incorrect) way to do politics when he said that he would enact policies ""not because they are politically correct, but because they are right."" Washington Post reporter Caitlin Gibson cited the quote in a January story headlined, ""How 'politically correct' went from compliment to insult."" In academic debates this year, people have used the words to dismiss the validity of those who advocate for ""safe spaces"" on college campuses and trigger warnings in classrooms. The author Lionel Shriver riled up literary circles this fall with a controversial speech at the Brisbane Writers Festival. Some called her intolerant and out of touch. Then others accused Shriver's critics of being too politically correct, another way of saying ""hypersensitive."" Comedian Bill Maher, whose aptly named TV show Politically Incorrect ran for nearly a decade, regularly skewers American politics and assails ""political correctness"" with commentary and satire on Real Time with Bill Maher, his HBO talk show. In a contentious piece for the Hollywood Reporter in February in which he announced his support for Sen. Bernie Sanders, Maher said Americans ""have been choking on political correctness and overly careful politicians for the last generation or two and are sick of it."" In that essay, Maher used the phrase as a synonym for cultural cowardice. So, to review: ""Politically correct"" means politically wise or invalid or hypersensitive or cowardice. Ruth Perry, a professor of literature at MIT, has written about the moment she thinks the phrase took a turn toward its most common contemporary usage: a rebuttal to the ideals or practice of diversity. That history, she says, starts in the 1960s, when Black Power advocates, along with what she called the New Left movement, used ""politically incorrect"" to mean people were out of step with the movement's orthodoxy. Perry, who founded MIT's women's studies program, wrote a widely cited 1992 essay in The Women's Review of Books to make the case that the phrase had been co-opted by political conservatives. At the time, people were battling over language that seemed to serve as proxy for deeper disagreements about how Americans should handle ideas of equality and equity. Mixed in with debates about whether or not ""manhole cover"" should include the word ""man,"" were more divisive arguments about whether things like affirmative action and multiculturalism were destroying liberal education. In her essay, Perry talked about the countless times she had come across articles, op-eds and books that used the phrase ""politically correct"" to assail people like her. It was a phrase she and her friends, all civil rights activists, used all the time, but not the way it was being used in her readings. ""The attack on the 'politically correct,' "" Perry wrote, ""in the universities is an attack on the theory and practice of affirmative action—a legacy of the sixties and seventies—defined as the recruitment to an institution of students and faculty who do not conform to what has always constituted the population of academic institutions: usually white, middle-class, straight, male."" It was our shorthand, and it was always used ironically. ... So that you would say, 'I know it's not politically correct, but I'm going to go get a hamburger anyway,' or, 'I know it's not politically correct, but I shave my legs.'  Ruth Perry The emerging definition was ""confusing to us, me and my buddies,"" Perry said in a recent interview. ""It was our shorthand, and it was always used ironically. It was always used as a joke. It was, I think, one of the ways we distinguished ourselves as the New Left from the Old Left. It was about not being dogmatic. So that you would say, 'I know it's not politically correct, but I'm going to go get a hamburger anyway,' or, 'I know it's not politically correct, but I shave my legs.' "" But the meaning had already started to shift to the right. In 1987, conservative philosopher Allan Bloom wrote the book The Closing of the American Mind, which a New York Times writer described as having ""wildfire success."" In the book, he railed against the so-called ""open minds"" in academia that he said had instead offered students narrow, liberal perspectives. To make his case, he pointed to the Black Power movement: ""The Black Power movement that supplanted the older civil rights movement—leaving aside both its excesses and its very understandable emphasis on self-respect and refusal to beg for acceptance—had at its core the view that the Constitutional tradition was always corrupt and was constructed as a defense of slavery. Its demand was for black identity, not universal rights. .... ""The upshot of all this for the education of young Americans is that they know much less about American history and those who were held to be its heroes. This was one of the few things that they used to come to college with that had something to do with their lives. Nothing has taken its place except a smattering of facts learned about other nations or cultures and a few social science formulas."" Bloom, who died in 1992, is cited regularly by conservative academics and writers. While he didn't use the phrase ""political correctness,"" his writing stoked the view that people were overly concerned with multiculturalism and diversity at the expense of rigorous education and free thinking. In a 1991 commencement speech at the University of Michigan, then-president George H.W. Bush took note of the conversation that was preoccupying the country. ""The notion of political correctness has ignited controversy across the land,"" he said. ""And although the movement arises from the laudable desire to sweep away the debris of racism and sexism and hatred, it replaces old prejudice with new ones."" Perry said that she and her colleagues ""all believed in consensus and discussion and so on, so we used the term to signify an idealistic belief in something, but the inability of the frail flesh to actually manage always to live up to it. And that's how we used it."" Victor Davis Hanson, a senior fellow at Stanford's Hoover Institution, said that language is being manipulated for political purposes all the time by the left and the right. But liberals, he suggested in an interview, are more concerned with being politically right than being factually correct. Conservatives, he said, prefer to ""say whatever you want and let it fall where it is, and we'll make the argument as it is."" ""Now,"" Hanson said, ""the left has destroyed the idea of absolute truth and legitimate ends. ... I think it's really dangerous what the left has done. They've created this effort to distort reality through vocabulary and they thought their agenda was enhanced by it."" It is the case that words are weapons in political discourse, and they always have been. Vincent Hutchings Today, ""politically correct"" is being used as a ""kind of linguistic jujitsu"" to disable an opponent's diversity argument, said Vincent Hutchings, a professor of American politics at the University of Michigan. ""It is the case that words are weapons in political discourse, and they always have been,"" Hutchings said. Trump has blamed ""political correctness"" for the Orlando shootings, for NBC's decision in 2015 to sever its ties with him over the speech announcing his candidacy, and for a Scottish university's decision to strip him of an honorary degree. Last month, the writer and academic Moira Weigel wrote for The Guardian that Trump hasn't just rejected ""political correctness""; he has reveled in being incorrect. ""Trump did not simply criticise the idea of political correctness – he actually said and did the kind of outrageous things that PC culture supposedly prohibited. The first wave of conservative critics of political correctness claimed they were defending the status quo, but Trump's mission was to destroy it. In 1991, when George HW Bush warned that political correctness was a threat to free speech, he did not choose to exercise his free speech rights by publicly mocking a man with a disability or characterising Mexican immigrants as rapists. Trump did. Having elevated the powers of PC to mythic status, the draft-dodging billionaire, son of a slumlord, taunted the parents of a fallen soldier and claimed that his cruelty and malice was, in fact, courage."" So, to review again: ""Politically correct"" means cowardly and courageous; invalid or hypersensitive; in step with the orthodoxy; distortion and linguistic jujitsu. The writer Lindy West offers a way out of this semantic loop: People who think the phrase is used to demonize things like social justice and diversity should drop it altogether and call things what they are. For years, she said in an interview, ""I've had to write the same piece about how being 'politically correct' is good. Letting terms just sit there and calcify and normalize just makes it more difficult to dismantle those concepts that ... language props up."" A tweet recently captured her view about the decades-long debate in fewer than 140 characters: now that we've covered ""alt-right = white supremacist,"" can we go back to calling political correctness &amp; identity politics ""civil rights""? We're definitely not post-racial. And we like things complicated. For more on who we are, look here. Don't know what it means to ""code-switch,"" this will help.

npr,"December 14, 2016","Carrier Got Cut A Deal, But Can Other Companies Expect The Same?"," It's been a few weeks since President-elect Donald Trump celebrated Indiana's Carrier company's decision to keep some factory jobs from moving to Mexico. Other manufacturers are wondering what the deal might mean for them. It's been a few weeks since President-elect Donald Trump celebrated the Carrier company's decision to keep some factory jobs in Indiana instead of moving them to Mexico. The deal hinged on $7 million in state tax credits — some of which came from a rarely used fund for job retention. And now it has manufacturers wondering what the deal might mean for them. Indiana doles out tens of millions of dollars in tax incentives to companies like Carrier every year — but usually those are for creating new jobs, not retaining existing ones. The Indiana Economic Development Corporation caps its credits for job retention at $10 million a year — and it's only actually awarded $15 million total since 2005. Compare that to the IEDC awarding $1.2 billion in job creation credits. Andrew Berger, a lobbyist with the Indiana Manufacturers Association, says that's because it's easier to measure the economic benefit of a new job than one that was already there. ""The overall goal is to grow the income base, not just maintain it,"" Berger says. Berger says there won't be much to stop companies, feeling emboldened by Carrier, from asking for more of that money — but with the spectacle around Carrier, and uncertainty around other reforms, most businesses seem cautious. ""My guess right now is that people are kind of in a wait-and-see mode, particularly if they haven't committed to an investment overseas — whether that's in Mexico or anyplace else,"" Berger says. Employees are waiting, too. At Rexnord's Indianapolis factory, which Trump also has criticized for plans to shift jobs to Mexico, production worker Tim Mathis has his hopes up. ""We're tickled to death that President-elect Trump was potentially able to save Carrier's jobs,"" Mathis says. ""But we also want our jobs, and all the other jobs that are being sent out of this country."" As the shift changes at a ZF TRW factory in Lafayette, Ind., most workers are already inside for their 5:30 p.m. start time. They're going to be making commercial steering equipment for big-rig trucks until about 3 a.m. There are two TRW factories in Lafayette, but the other one is going to be closing in just a few weeks. Some of the workers will come here, and some of them are going to be laid off. Larry DeBoer, an economist at Purdue University, says companies like ZF TRW don't really face penalties for offshoring jobs. The company wouldn't comment on the role its overseas businesses played in the 65 layoffs it's planning in Lafayette, but workers did get a federal certification saying the jobs were impacted by global trade as positions move to China. DeBoer says the company could have asked the state for retention money, or for incentives to expand its factories or teach workers new skills instead of firing them — all breaks Carrier got. He says companies need more than just incentives to keep jobs here — they're watching to see if Trump will impose the kinds of offshoring penalties he campaigned on. ""Eventually there's got to be some nationwide policy — passed by Congress, presumably — that addresses this problem,"" DeBoer says. ""But you can't possibly have the president occupy himself, business by business by business, every time there's a report that somebody's going to move offshore."" Expectations like DeBoer's haven't seemed to limit the president-elect so far, and he has pledged to make some big trade and regulatory reforms in his first 100 days in office.

npr,"December 14, 2016",Trump And Technology Executives Try To Reconcile Rough Relationship," President-elect Donald Trump met Wednesday afternoon with a who's-who of the tech industry. They came from Silicon Valley and elsewhere to Trump Tower in Manhattan, where they talked about jobs and innovation. At the start of the meeting, which was open to pool reporters, Trump told the tech executives he was ""here to help you folks do well,"" and referred to the ""bounce"" in the stock market since Election Day, saying, ""Right now everybody in this room has to like me a little bit."" (Though for the most part, tech companies have lagged behind the big gains.) It was no secret that most of Silicon Valley backed Democrat Hillary Clinton in the presidential election, and Trump openly feuded with some tech companies during the campaign. He called for a boycott of Apple because of its refusal to help the government unlock an iPhone used by the San Bernardino shooter last December, and he also called on Apple to make its iPhones in the U.S. And he has also criticized Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon and owner of The Washington Post, over the newspaper's reporting during the campaign. In May, Trump called The Post a ""toy"" that Bezos used ""for power so that the politicians in Washington don't tax Amazon like they should be taxed."" Bezos was in the room today, along with Tim Cook of Apple, Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook, Elon Musk of Tesla and top executives from Microsoft, Oracle, IBM and other tech giants — as well as investor Peter Thiel, one of the few tech leaders who supported Trump's campaign, and who arranged today's meeting. Three of Trump's adult children were also present. Trump told the executives that his team ""has no chain of command,"" and that his phone line would be open to them. There's no shortage of issues for the group to discuss. The tech companies are highly reliant on highly skilled immigrants coming to the U.S., and so that's a concern for them, given Trumps views on immigration. And China is a big issue — not only in terms of the products that U.S. tech companies manufacture there, but also as a market for their products. There are fears that a trade war with China could injure the companies' bottom lines. But tech leaders aren't worried about everything on the president-elect's plans. Their companies have billions of dollars in profits sitting overseas, which they say is because of high U.S. corporate tax rates. Presumably the companies would repatriate those profits if tax rates were lower, which is something at the top of Trump's agenda. One of the few high-profile tech companies that was excluded from Wednesday's meeting was Twitter — Trump's preferred social platform. A Politico story suggested this was in response to Twitter rejecting the Trump campaign's #CrookedHillary emoji earlier this year. Trump's transition team says Twitter was not invited because it is too small. All Tech Considered explores how technology is changing culture and connection.

npr,"December 14, 2016",Webpages Linked To Pizzeria Shooting Go Dark Even As Prosecution Moves Forward," On Dec. 4, a man named Edgar Welch walked into a Washington, D.C., pizzeria with two loaded guns and demanded to search the premises before firing one of the weapons and, eventually, being arrested. A criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court this week lays out the FBI's evidence that Welch had been reading websites, listening to radio broadcasts and watching at least one YouTube video that led him to believe, incorrectly, that child abuse was occurring in hidden rooms at the restaurant, Comet Ping Pong. You can read more here about how the so-called Pizzagate lie got started, but briefly: ""Internet users have developed a wholly fictitious conspiracy theory that maintains Comet Ping Pong is the site of an international satanic child sex abuse cabal hosted by powerful Democrats, including Hillary Clinton. Speculation and fabrications tied to the bizarre conspiracy theory have been relentlessly circulated by politically motivated fringe sites."" The prosecution of Welch, who is from North Carolina, for illegally transporting firearms with the intent to commit a crime will almost certainly include evidence from the Internet, as the criminal complaint makes clear. But as the case moves forward, a website that amplified the conspiracy theory has removed content related to it, although archived versions are still accessible to authorities. The website Infowars.com has removed a misleading page titled: ""PIZZAGATE IS REAL: SOMETHING IS GOING ON, BUT WHAT?"" as well as a YouTube video about the fictitious plot.

 Another video on the same site, which matches a video described in the criminal complaint against Welch, is still active. Another potential source of the type of misleading information cited by Welch was shut down not by the people posting the information but by the website on which it was hosted. In late November, the Internet forum reddit.com banned a forum page called ""/r/pizzagate"" after it said people posted ""personal and confidential information."" ""We don't want witchhunts on our site,"" reddit's administrators wrote. This week, a member of President-elect Donald Trump's transition team also deleted a tweet linking to a different fake story alleging that officials in the Democratic Party were connected to child sex abuse. That tweet, originally posted on Nov. 2 by Gen. Michael Flynn, read: ""U decide - NYPD Blows Whistle on New Hillary Emails: Money Laundering, Sex Crimes w Children, etc...MUST READ!""

 Flynn then linked to a story on a website called truepundit.com that included unfounded accusations about the Democratic presidential nominee.

npr,"December 14, 2016",Seattle Natives Identify Gentrification By Who's Riding The Bus," When Donald Trump won the presidential election, he made a pledge to every citizen: that he would be president for all Americans. In the weeks before Trump's inauguration, we're going to hear about some of the communities that make up this nation, from the people who know them best, in our series Finding America. The No. 48 bus runs through the Central District of Seattle. This piece was produced by Mona Yeh and Yuko Kodama of Localore: Finding America, a national production of AIR, the Association of Independents in Radio. Find more stories at NPR and at Finding America. It's a historically black community that Carla Saulter and Gabriel Teodros know well. It's also a neighborhood that is gentrifying as Seattle has boomed in the past decade. During a ride on the 48, the two bus companions discussed the changes they've been seeing in their city. Saulter says riding the bus allows her to see how different parts of the city have changed physically and demographically. ""The thing about the 48 is that it goes through so many different communities,"" Saulter says. ""Of course, over time, the riders of the bus [have] changed, and that's one of the ways you can really see, just viscerally feel, the changes in the community, is that who's riding the bus is so different now than it was even 10 years ago.""

npr,"December 14, 2016",Trump Tower's Newest Tenants Likely To Be The Secret Service," Trump Tower, the building that President-elect Donald Trump calls home, bills itself as ""one of the world's elite luxury residences, catering to public figures, athletes, celebrities and other affluent sophisticates."" These days, some other people have taken up residence there as well: Secret Service agents. Trump has said that his family won't move into the White House right away and will remain, for a few months at least, in the world-famous steel-and-glass office and residential building where they occupy three floors. Even after his family makes the move, Trump seems likely to be a regular visitor in Manhattan, where he has lived for decades. For the Secret Service, that means setting up a vast intelligence and surveillance operation inside the building. ""Essentially what you have to do is make Trump Tower as secure as the White House,"" says former Secret Service agent Jonathan Wackrow. To do that, the Secret Service will almost certainly have to lease space inside the building, which is partly owned by Trump himself, giving the president-elect an opportunity to make money off the very agency assigned to protect him. It will probably have to do so at Trump's Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, as well. Wackrow, who is now executive director of the risk assessment company RANE, says this isn't at all unusual. The agency leased space in Crawford, Texas, where former President George W. Bush owned a ranch, and in Chappaqua, N.Y., the home of Bill and Hillary Clinton. ""We do it at a lot of facilities. Anytime the federal government is taking private space, it's logical for there to be a rental fee around that,"" Wackrow says. The difference is that Trump Tower is located in a ritzy shopping district in Midtown Manhattan, one of the most expensive places on earth, so rents there are likely to be a good bit higher than in Crawford. Just how much higher is hard to say. Secret Service officials are still trying to assess what they need to protect the Trumps and what the agency's ""footprint"" will be inside the building, so they didn't want to comment for this story. The Trump campaign was paying $35,458 a month to lease space in the building as recently as last March, but the price increased nearly five-fold by July. Critics said the increase — to a monthly rent of $169,758 — was a way of fleecing donors at a time when they were increasingly contributing to Trump's campaign. Steve Siegel, chairman of global brokerage at the giant commercial real estate firm CBRE, says office space in Trump Tower typically rents for about $70 a square foot, which amounts to $700,000 a year for 10,000 square feet of space. That's less than in premium properties such as the GM Building, which can go for $95 to $190 per square foot. It's not that there's anything wrong with Trump Tower, which is an attractive building with high ceilings, usable space and plenty of light, Siegel says. But much of Trump Tower consists of condominiums. Only the first 26 floors of the 68-story building are set aside for offices and retail stores, and some of that has been occupied by Trump's own businesses. Not enough space is left over for really big companies, and that lowers the price that the building can fetch, Siegel says. Major tenants also prefer to put their own names on buildings, and Trump Tower is already named for Trump, Siegel notes. Siegel adds that the presence of the Secret Service could actually end up hurting the building's value. Already, police have had to seal off the streets around the building, requiring anyone who lives or works in the building to pass through security checks. ""I just passed the building now and they were three deep and barricades and police everywhere,"" he said. While some people may feel safer as a result, a lot of potential tenants won't want to put up with it. ""I don't think I could put a tenant in there that would be comfortable with the security measures that are required by the president-elect living there and having his offices there,"" Siegel says.

npr,"December 14, 2016",Trump Puts Ronna Romney McDaniel In Line To Be Next RNC Chairwoman," Michigan GOP Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel is in line to lead the Republican National Committee. President-elect Donald Trump announced McDaniel's appointment on Wednesday as the RNC deputy chair. That puts her in place to succeed outgoing Chairman Reince Priebus, whom Trump has already tapped as his White House chief of staff. A supporter of Trump's during the primary, McDaniel not only oversaw a critical state that helped Trump pull off his upset win but is also the niece of Mitt Romney. The 2012 GOP presidential nominee was a vocal opponent of Trump's during the primary, but he later walked back his criticism as he made a failed pitch to become secretary of state. ""I'm excited to have a highly effective leader in Ronna McDaniel as RNC Deputy Chair and I look forward to her serving as the Party's Chairman in 2017,"" Trump said in a statement. ""Ronna has been extremely loyal to our movement and her efforts were critical to our tremendous victory in Michigan, and I know she will bring the same passion to the Republican National Committee."" McDaniel has led the Michigan GOP since February 2015 and helped turn the state red for the first time since 1988. Trump praised her efforts last week at a stop in Michigan on his ""thank you"" tour, telling her and the crowd, ""I was very impressed with you. She didn't sleep for six months."" The choice of McDaniel is also seen as a victory by Priebus, who reportedly preferred her over Nick Ayers. Some Trump loyalists were pushing for Ayers, an aide to Vice President-elect Mike Pence, to get the job. In the same statement, Priebus called her ""an outstanding fundraiser, and her ability to drive support for our mission of electing Republicans up and down the ballot gives me full confidence that she will be able to continue building on the RNC's success and organizational strength as we head into important elections in 2017 and 2018."" Trump also appointed his Ohio state director, Bob Paduchik, to be deputy co-chairman. Both are expected to be voted on next month at the RNC's winter meeting, but typically RNC members respect the wishes of an incoming or sitting president. So with Priebus' exit, McDaniel would be the new leader of the RNC with Paduchik as her No. 2. NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor ",http://www.npr.org/505011547
npr,"December 14, 2016",Partisan Divide Colors Obama's Place In History," As President Obama prepares to leave office, 45 percent of Americans think he'll be remembered as an outstanding or above-average president, according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center. That's the highest average for an outgoing president since Ronald Reagan. But pollsters found a deep partisan divide, with Republicans expressing much less support for Obama's historical record than Democrats. Obama's job approval rating has climbed to its highest level since just after his re-election, with 58 percent of Americans saying they approve of his performance. An even larger share — 64 percent — say they have a favorable impression of Obama personally. But the president still falls short of the first lady. Michelle Obama is viewed favorably by 72 percent. The president's place in history is anchored by passage of the Affordable Care Act, which 35 percent of survey respondents cite as his most memorable accomplishment. That's a tenuous legacy, though, as President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican Congress have vowed to repeal the law, which extends health insurance to more than 20 million Americans. An additional 17 percent of respondents say Obama will be most remembered as the first African-American president, while 7 percent point to his efforts to boost the economy. Only 9 percent of those polled say Obama will be most remembered for his foreign policy. Historical assessments of a president's record often change with the passage of time. But at this point, Obama is viewed as outstanding or above-average by more Americans (45 percent) than Bill Clinton (42 percent), George H.W. Bush (36 percent) and George W. Bush (11 percent) were at the end of their time in office. Reagan had the highest rating among modern presidents — he was viewed as outstanding or above-average by 59 percent. In a sign of growing polarization, there's a much wider gulf today between the way Democrats and Republicans rate Obama than there was for past presidents — 71 percent of Democrats or Democratic-leaners say Obama will be remembered as outstanding or above-average. Only 15 percent of Republicans agree. Bill Clinton's overall rating when he left office was similar, but the partisan gap was less pronounced. Republicans were somewhat more generous in their assessment of Clinton's place in history than they are of Obama's, while Democrats were slightly less so.

npr,"December 14, 2016",Wilbur Ross: The Best Commerce Secretary Pick Dems Could Hope For?," Billionaire Wilbur Ross Jr. is one of the wealthiest members of what's being called Donald Trump's ""gilded cabinet."" The parade of Wall Street and corporate elites is drawing sharp criticism from many on the left. But actually, Ross, who Trump has chosen as his secretary of commerce, is respected by organized labor. Those close to him say he is not a right-wing ideologue, and some who've known him over the years say he's the best possible pick that Democrats could hope for. But that's not stopping left wing advocacy groups from criticizing Ross. On an online petition to ""block Trump's cabinet of hate and Wall Street greed,"" the group Demand Progress describes Wilbur Ross as a ""notorious vulture investor,"" because Ross has profited from buying up dying companies. Leo Gerard is international president of the United Steelworkers union and he represented workers after Ross bought up several bankrupt steel mills back in 2002. When NPR asked about Ross' reputation as a vulture capitalist, Gerard said Ross wasn't a vulture at all. Vultures feast on a dying or dead animal. Ross was more like a rescue helicopter swooping down. ""Well look, the relationship we had with him was one where he was open and accessible and candid and honest and he put a lot of money back into the mills,"" Gerard says. ""So literally tens of thousands of jobs were saved."" Starting in the late '90s there was a massive global surplus of steel. ""We ended up with a steel crash in America where 35 to 40 companies went bankrupt,"" Gerard says. Gerard is a labor leader. He says he's seen the dark side of Wall Street investors coming in to profit off a steel company's misfortune. He says they raid the pension fund, sell off parts of the company, and all the workers lose their jobs. ""We've had experiences where we've had so called bottom feeders come in and sucked the capital out of [the companies] and left them there to die,"" he says. But Gerard says that's not what Wilber Ross did. Gerard says Ross saved the companies. And he even restored some of the retirees healthcare benefits after a bankruptcy court wiped them out, even if the benefits weren't as generous after Ross brought the company out of bankruptcy. Ross also turned to the blue collar workers for ideas on how to be more efficient, a fact Gerard says he liked about Ross' technique. Wilbur Ross talked about this approach in an NPR interview in 2008: ""We got an enormous amount of good ideas from the blue collar workers,"" Ross said. ""That fellow who has been standing behind a machine for 10 years, knows it better than the people who built it, really knows what to do."" Ross sold off the companies a few years later under the name International Steel Group for $4.5 billion. Gerard says by that time Ross had restructured the steel mills in a fair, sustainable, and smart way. ""With Wilbur it's been almost 15 years now, and those mills are [still] running and some of them are the most productive in North America,"" Gerard says. By that time, ISG had become the largest steel company in America by buying up failing steel companies including Bethlehem Steel, LTV Steel and Acme Steel. Gerard says the jobs Ross saved were at the mills themselves and at the companies in supply chain. Given this good relationship with the Steelworkers union, and that Ross is a former Democrat who was involved with the Clinton administration (before backing Romney and later Trump for president,) you might think democrats and liberals would be OK with Ross as Commerce Secretary. But he's still being lumped in with what critics describe as a cabal of wealthy elites getting ready to take over America. ""There's massive skepticism about Ross and his record,"" says Kurt Walters a campaign director with Demand Progress. He says the steel industry aside, when Ross bought textile companies, he did exactly what Donald Trump criticized during the campaign — he killed jobs in the U.S. ""He was very willing to ship American textile jobs from U.S. factories over to China and over to Mexico,"" says Walters. Still, Ross also kept textile jobs in the U.S. And even some in the labor movement don't vilify him for owning factories overseas. Scott Paul is a democrat and the President of the non-partisan Alliance for American Manufacturing. It's a union-business partnership that promotes American-made products. ""Wilbur Ross, he reminds me of a trauma surgeon, in a way, who's dealing with a patient who's in crisis,"" says Paul. ""There may be some unpleasantness associated with it. You might lose a limb, but he's gonna save your life."" And he said the workers whose jobs he saved have a strong appreciation for that. One former employee of Ross's who spoke to NPR says Ross is the opposite of the flamboyant Donald Trump. He remembers picking the billionaire up at the airport for the first time. He expected a private jet and an entourage. But he says Ross flew commercial, without any assistants, and got off dragging an easel and some charts for a presentation he was about to make in Congress about the auto bailout. This time, when Ross comes to Washington, these labor leaders say they hope he's the same guy they came to know who understood how to balance profits with the interests of working class Americans.

npr,"December 14, 2016",Rex Tillerson Gained Some Diplomatic Experience As ExxonMobil CEO," President-elect Donald Trump's choice for secretary of state is ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson. Tillerson has spent four decades at the company, and he's announced he'll retire at the end of the year. If confirmed, Tillerson would be the first secretary of state to have never worked in government before. But as NPR's Jeff Brady reports, he does have some diplomatic experience. JEFF BRADY, BYLINE: Imagine the life of an oil company CEO. If you're thinking it's all private jets and cigars, well, maybe that's part of it, but global politics also is an important element. JOHN HOFMEISTER: I had a secret clearance with the CIA, with the FBI, et cetera. BRADY: John Hofmeister was president of Shell Oil for three years about a decade back. He says regular contact with those agencies and the State Department is an important part of an oil company executive's job. HOFMEISTER: I was informing them, they were informing me of the security issues and the security concerns of where we might have people at risk. BRADY: Multinational oil companies like Shell and ExxonMobil drill in some dangerous places. To minimize the risks, they need good relations with the governments where they operate. Maintaining those can be a kind of diplomacy, and that's why Hofmeister, who's a Democrat, feels comfortable saying this about Rex Tillerson. HOFMEISTER: I think he's spent a career preparing for such a gigantic role as secretary of state. BRADY: Since his nomination, Tillerson has not granted interviews to journalists, but his supporters are out talking up his credentials. Tillerson is on the board of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank focused on international politics. John Hamre is president and CEO and says at meetings Tillerson often demonstrates that he knows as much or more than scholars at the center. JOHN HAMRE: He interacts with more heads of state than anybody on my board. And I have very impressive members on my board - people like Zbig Brzezinski and Henry Kissinger. BRADY: Hamre says as head of ExxonMobil, Tillerson has skills and information that'll be valuable when he meets with world leaders as secretary of state. HAMRE: You need to know the internal dynamics of the society. You need to know what their economy is like, what their energy picture is like. I mean, it requires just detailed knowledge and preparation. These are all attributes that, you know - that every secretary of state uses every day. BRADY: But all that experience was gained as a business executive with the goal of getting oil out of the ground and making a profit. That leaves some wondering if Tillerson can adapt those skills to be secretary of state. Andrew Steere is president and CEO of the World Resources Institute. ANDREW STEER: Most of his shareholders think he's done a good job for them. And that should give some hope that he might do a good job for his new shareholders, who are the citizens of the United States. Seventy percent of them have said they want action on climate change urgently. BRADY: Steer says the secretary of state plays an important role in addressing climate change. At ExxonMobil, Tillerson moved the company closer to Steer's point of view on this. And Tillerson has expressed support for the Paris climate accord, but President-elect Trump has threatened to pull out of the agreement. For Andrew Steer, that leaves an open question - where a Secretary Tillerson would come down on climate change. STEER: That's why the confirmation hearings are so very important - because there are some very, very important questions that need to be asked and addressed. BRADY: Even some Republican senators expressed concerns about Tiller's nomination and whether or not he can set aside his business-focused past and become an effective secretary of state.

npr,"December 14, 2016","Despite Past Differences, Trump Meets With Tech Industry Leaders"," In New York, President-elect Donald Trump met with a group of tech executives today. Leaders from Google, Apple, Facebook and several others joined the meeting at Trump Tower. Here's some of what Trump had to say at the start. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: I'm here to help you folks do well, and you're doing well right now. And I'm very honored by the bounce. They're all talking about the bounce, so right now everybody in this room has to like me at least a little bit. But we're going to try and have that bounce continue, and perhaps even more importantly, we want you to keep going with the incredible innovation. There's nobody like you in the world. CORNISH: NPR's Brian Naylor joins me now in the studio to talk about this meeting. Hey, there, Brian. BRIAN NAYLOR, BYLINE: Hi, Audie. CORNISH: Let's start with that bit about the bounce. What does that mean? NAYLOR: (Laughter) So, well, the bounce is in the stock market, which has been doing very well since Election Day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average almost reached the magical 20,000 mark today, although it closed a bit lower. Interestingly, though, tech stocks haven't endured quite the rise the rest of the stock market has. CORNISH: So help us understand what Trump meant when he said that this group has to like him at least a little bit. NAYLOR: A little bit - well, it's no secret that most of Silicon Valley backed Hillary Clinton in the election, and Trump openly feuded with some tech companies during the campaign. He called for a boycott of Apple over its refusal to help the government unlock an iPhone used by the San Bernardino shooter last December. He also criticized Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon and the owner of The Washington Post, over The Post's reporting during the campaign. Here's what he said about Bezos back in May. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: This is owned as a toy by Jeff Bezos, who controls Amazon. Amazon is getting away with murder tax-wise. He's using The Washington Post for power so that the politicians in Washington don't tax Amazon like they should be taxed. NAYLOR: So, interestingly, Bezos was in the room today, along with Tim Cook of Apple, along with Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook and many others, as well Trump's adult children. CORNISH: So is the sense here that Trump is letting bygones be bygones? NAYLOR: I think there's a little bit of fence-mending going on. We don't know exactly what went on in the room when the cameras weren't there, but it's safe to say there are some big issues on the table that both sides want to see resolved. The tech companies - very reliant on highly skilled immigrants coming to the U.S. - and so that's a concern for them, given Trump's thoughts on immigration. China is a big issue, not only in terms of the products that U.S. tech companies manufacture there, but also as a market for their products. There are fears that a trade war could have a negative effect on their bottom lines. CORNISH: And in the meantime, Trump told them, give me a call, right? He says he has no formal chain of command. NAYLOR: Yeah, he seemed to want to open up some lines of communication. He and the tech leaders would like to see from Trump - the companies have billions of dollars in profits sitting overseas that they say they would bring home if tax rates were lower. And that's one area where they and the president-elect do see eye-to-eye - lowering corporate tax rates. CORNISH: That's NPR's Brian Naylor. Brian, thank you. NAYLOR: Thank you.

npr,"December 14, 2016",Cybersecurity Firm Confirms Russian Hackers Breached The DNC," DMITRI ALPEROVITCH: Thank you. CORNISH: When the DNC first called you, what were the early indications of who might be involved? ALPEROVITCH: Well, we right away were able to determine that there were two intrusions inside the network, two separate actors that we affiliated with the Russian intelligence services that we call Fancy Bear and Cozy Bear that were inside. We did that by installing our software that we call Falcon on every machine within the DNC, every one of their laptops and servers on their corporate network. And it functioned essentially as a video camera inside the computer, allowing us to record and look at every activity that was taking place inside that machine. So we were able to literally shoulder surf and observe what these attackers were doing while inside the network. CORNISH: Oh, and what are some of the I guess markers of a hack or of a particular hacker that maybe they leave behind? ALPEROVITCH: Well, so any time you do an investigation of the sort, you collect a lot of digital evidence, sort of the equivalent of fingerprints at a crime scene where you're looking at, what exactly are the tools that they used to break in? How did they move around from one machine to another? How did they try to hide themselves within the network? Those are the telltale signs typically of a particular group. And these hackers - they tend to be lazy. Once they figure out what works, they tend to repeat it again and again and again across many victims. And that's their Achilles' heel. CORNISH: What surprised you about how these Russian-connected groups went about their work? I mean were you surprised at the boldness of this move? ALPEROVITCH: I really wasn't initially because at the time we were brought in, I assumed it was a traditional espionage operations. Political parties get targeted all the time. In fact during the 2008 and 2012 campaigns, we had other nation states like China targeting campaigns. But they were not releasing that information publicly. They were taking policy documents, information about people involved in the campaign and providing that as information to the Chinese leadership. I assume that the Russians were interested in the same thing. And it really was surprising to me when we started to see all these leaks coming out from the DNC and other organizations that have been targeted. And it became very, very clear that the goal here was not just espionage but really to influence this election. CORNISH: Lisa Monaco, President Obama's homeland security and counterterrorism adviser, says the U.S. is responding to Russia. But what do you make of the U.S.'s kind of broader response to the hack so far? ALPEROVITCH: Well, I've been very disappointed in their response. Not only have they waited very, very long time to actually conduct the public attribution. It was done as a statement. Compare that to when the North Koreans hacked into Sony and destroyed the Sony Network. You had the president coming out and stating that it was North Korea and using his bully pulpit to announce sanctions against North Korean regime. Nothing of the sort was done against Russia, and arguably this was a much more important intrusion in terms of influencing our election versus just an attack on one company. CORNISH: We've also heard reports that the U.S. was concerned about essentially escalating these tensions. And is that something worth thinking about here as we go forward and figure out the rules of engagement when it comes to cyber-warfare? ALPEROVITCH: Well, you always want to worry about escalation, and you certainly don't want any attacks in the cyber realm to then start migrate into the physical realm where we may actually get into a hot conflict with Russia. That's not in anyone's interests. But at the same time, you can't simply take these types of attacks, particularly when they're impacting the most vital institution that we have in this country, our democratic process and the idea of free and fair election. And you have to absolutely stand up to Russia and let them know that this is unacceptable and that there will be repercussions if they continue this behavior. CORNISH: Dmitri Alperovitch, thank you so much for speaking with us. ALPEROVITCH: Thanks for having me.

npr,"December 14, 2016",Homeland Security Adviser Suggests U.S. May Respond To Russian Cyberactivity," We begin this hour with an update on Russian cyber-meddling during the election. President Obama has ordered his spy chiefs to look into what exactly happened and to report back before he leaves office. The public learned about this investigation last week when Lisa Monaco announced it. Monaco has spent nearly four years at Obama's side as his adviser for homeland security and counterterrorism. She sat down with NPR's Mary Louise Kelly this afternoon at the White House, and now Mary Louise is here to tell us about that conversation. Good to see you. MARY LOUISE KELLY, BYLINE: And you, Robert. SIEGEL: Well, what does Lisa Monaco have to say about this report? KELLY: Well, I asked her how thorough it's going to be given that it's a bit of a rush job, has to be finished by January 20. I asked her what lessons she's actually hoping to learn and also asked her to respond to criticism of how the administration has handled the whole Russian cyber-meddling affair. So let me play you a minute or two from the interview. This is a long clip, but I want to give you a sense of - a flavor of the conversation. So here's Monaco. LISA MONACO: We are in a new world when it comes to cyber-vulnerability and the cyber threat. And what we want to do is compile everything we know about what's happened, put that in one place, capture some lessons learned, after-action this so we can make sure we are optimally prepared to make sure this doesn't happen again. KELLY: You will be aware that there's been criticism that the Obama administration didn't hit back more forcefully as this was unfolding during the campaign. The New York Times has a big front page story today in which they quote a senior State Department official who says - and I'll quote - everyone agreed you had to push back at the Russians and push back hard, but it didn't happen. Lisa Monaco, why not? MONACO: The president's been very clear. We will take steps to protect our interests, and we will do so at a time and place of our choosing. What we did over the summer is make very clear in an unprecedented statement that the director of National Intelligence and DHS issued that quite publicly and directly attributed the malicious cyber activity and the intrusions into emails and political institutions to Russian actors and quite frankly to the highest levels of the Russian government. What we also did was message quite clearly, quite directly, including at the level of the president - to Putin - our concern about this activity. KELLY: But to follow on this, issuing a statement from the DNI - the director of national intelligence - that may be unprecedented. It is hardly responding like for like. It is hardly a forceful pushback against Russia. MONACO: What we were concerned about was the integrity of our election system and our election process, which is why we issued that unprecedented statement, which is why the intelligence community briefed members of Congress, which is why we engaged across the government, across all levels of government. And the Russians are quite clear and can make no mistake about what our concerns are. SIEGEL: Lisa Monaco talking with our Mary Louise Kelly. Mary Louise, did Monaco rule out President Obama perhaps hitting back hard? He's got over a month left in office. KELLY: He does, and she did not rule it out. In fact she left that door wide open, which is interesting. The administration has always said all options remain on the table. But the clock is ticking, so let's hear her answer to that question. MONACO: We're going to be concerned about not escalating malicious cyber activity, and we're going to be very clear and proportional in our response. And that's what the public can expect. There will always be Monday morning quarterbacking. But I guess what I would say is, the game continues. KELLY: The game continues. So might we still see some form of retaliation between now and January 20? MONACO: I will leave it at what we said before, which is, we will respond at a time and place of our choosing. And the other thing I would say, Mary Louise, is the public should not expect to always see every element of our response. KELLY: And Robert, I pushed Lisa Monaco on that and said the public does have an interest in seeing that the U.S. isn't pushed around. And there is a sense that Russia has gotten the better of the U.S. in this latest round of cyber tit-for-tat. She took issue with that and said, you want proof? Look at Election Day. There was no uptick in cyber activity. SIEGEL: But actually tampering with ballot boxes on Election Day is different from stealing documents and leaking embarrassing information during the campaign. KELLY: It absolutely is. The horse was - I think it's safe to say - out of the barn at that point. SIEGEL: Finally, did Lisa Monaco, who has spent four years at the White House, have any advice for her successor? KELLY: She did. We did the interview in the basement of the White House where her office is in the West Wing. We pointed at her inbox which was overflowing. And I said, what's going to be on top for your successor? She said terrorism and the cyber threat - the big one. SIEGEL: NPR's Mary Louise Kelly - Mary Louise, thanks. KELLY: You're so welcome. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"December 14, 2016",Federal Agencies Pressure Trump To Address Conflicts Of Interest," Two federal agencies have now cautiously challenged President-elect Donald Trump to uphold federal ethics standards. They want Trump to avoid conflicts of interest between his administration and his business. NPR's Peter Overby reports. PETER OVERBY, BYLINE: Trump has interests in more than 500 business entities spread across at least 20 countries. To avoid the obvious conflicts of interest they would present, his plan has been to run the government while his children run the business. Here's Trump on ""Fox News"" Sunday this week. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""FOX NEWS"") DONALD TRUMP: Hopefully, they're going to run it properly. I'm sure they're going to run properly, but I'm not going to do deals. And I think, you know - I think that's going to be good. OVERBY: His critics don't think so. It's true that presidents are exempt from federal conflict of interest rules, but they've always complied with them so far. Now at the Office of Government Ethics, the agency that helps newly elected officials navigate the federal ethics laws, the director has gone on record saying Trump's plan to keep his family involved wouldn't eliminate the conflicts of interest. Democrats and advocates of clean government are pushing for Congress to look into the conflict issues. Here's Democratic Congressman Elijah Cummings at a bipartisan forum today. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ELIJAH CUMMINGS: This is bigger than our president-elect. This is bigger than this moment. This is about our democracy and the laws that go with it. OVERBY: Besides the Office of Government Ethics, the federal General Services Administration weighed in today on another conflict of interest - the Trump Hotel in Washington's old Post Office Building. GSA owns the building. Trump leases it, but federal elected officials are barred from being on the lease or benefiting from it. Cummings and other Democrats say a GSA deputy commissioner told them last week Trump will be breaching the lease the moment he takes office. But this afternoon GSA backed away from that language. The spokesperson said the agency can't assess the situation until Trump takes office. The president-elect has long promised a press conference to explain his ethics policies. It was going to be tomorrow, in fact, till it was postponed. It hasn't been rescheduled. Sean Spicer on the transition team had this response to a question in this morning's press briefing. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) SEAN SPICER: This will be something that comes up at the press conference the president-elect will now be holding in January. OVERBY: Meanwhile, lawyers and advocacy groups are talking quietly about an organized push on ethics issues. Daniel Bryan is the head of a watchdog group called the Project on Government Oversight, or POGO. DANIELLE BRIAN: This is about sort of preserving the integrity of the government and the Constitution. OVERBY: Such an effort would likely use freedom of information requests, lawsuits and similar tools aimed at specific cases. And the long range goal? Get Congress to take up the ethics issues.

npr,"December 14, 2016",Scientists Race To Preserve Climate Change Data Before Trump Takes Office," We started by talking about what's driving the effort given that as far as our science reporting team can see, there's been nothing to suggest the incoming administration plans to dump or delete data. ERIC HOLTHAUS: I wouldn't expect the Trump team to come out and say, you know, by the way, we're going to just delete all of the work that you guys have done for the last decades. I think the most likely scenario is that there will be across-the-board budget cuts in the realm of climate science across multiple parts of the government. NASA and the EPA and the Department of Energy come to mind. People that work there are going to have to make tough choices, and maybe that means not being able to maintain data sets in the same way that they have over the last several years. CORNISH: All right, so help us understand what kind of data is out there. HOLTHAUS: There are climate data sets that are scattered all throughout the federal government. The ones that come to mind are those at NASA and NOAA that take the temperature of the planet from weather stations, from satellites, from ocean buoys. There are satellites that take an assessment periodically of forest fires. There are assessments of Arctic sea ice. Any and all knowledge that we have of the climate system - in many cases, the U.S. government is the leader on that in the entire world. And scientists all over the world rely on the data that's collected here. Sometimes these data sets are only stored in United States government servers, so there hasn't really been an effort to catalog those in other countries because we haven't thought it was necessary before. CORNISH: So you believe this is necessary now, and you put out a call online, on Twitter and social media. Who's helping you, you know, and how are they saving this data? HOLTHAUS: So these were climate scientists or people that use climate data that volunteered their knowledge of what is most important. We also have developers, tech companies that are working on their own time. We have data storage companies that have volunteered space. We have computer science professors. It's truly remarkable the quick attention that it's received and the number of people that are volunteering to help. CORNISH: Is it any more helpful to have all of this data kind of scattered around the world and on random servers? HOLTHAUS: So part of the reason that we are interested in storing this data either on the cloud or scattered across the world is that it's harder for someone who maybe maliciously would want to destroy it to access it. So there are ways of keeping this data open and publicly available and uninterrupted during any sort of era (laughter) of our government that might be hostile to climate science. And it definitely feels like we are entering a time when climate scientists feel the need to sort of hunker down and preserve what they've done so far. This project is helping them to continue their work uninterrupted. CORNISH: What's your response to people who look at this and see paranoia, right? Donald Trump can't kind of walk into some computing center in the government and hit a button that says delete. HOLTHAUS: Sure. And again, the goal in this project is not out of some paranoia of a conspiracy to erase knowledge from humanity. It's to make sure that we are advocating for climate science in the sense that these scientists have devoted their lives, and they are now going to be operating under a government that is hostile to climate science. And we don't really know what to expect. We're acting out of an abundance of caution. It's not because of something that we think will happen. It's because we can't honestly project what might happen anymore. CORNISH: Eric Holthaus is a meteorologist. He writes for Slate and is host of ""Warm Regards,"" a podcast about climate change. Thank you for speaking with us. HOLTHAUS: Thank you so much. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

npr,"December 14, 2016",Environmentalists Brace For Scott Pruitt To Take Over EPA," Trump's nominee to lead the Environmental Protection Agency has questioned the science behind climate change. Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt has sued the EPA over what he calls its activist agenda. Both Pruitt and Trump want states to have more control over environmental regulations. Joe Wertz of StateImpact Oklahoma reports that if Pruitt is confirmed, he could test the limits of that idea. JOE WERTZ, BYLINE: A republican president created the EPA. Richard Nixon's idea was pretty simple. Pollution is an enemy that does not stop for state lines, and the only way to beat it is with a coordinated attack led by the federal government. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RICHARD NIXON: Clean air and clean water, the wise use of our land, the protection of wildlife and natural beauty, parks for all to enjoy - these are part of the birthright of every American. WERTZ: Today Scott Pruitt and other Republicans say the EPA is attacking a lot more than pollution. Here's Pruitt testifying against the Clean Power Plan at a Senate subcommittee hearing. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SCOTT PRUITT: When the EPA exceeds the constraints placed upon the agency by Congress, the relationship is thrown out of balance, and the rule of law and state sovereignty is affected adversely. WERTZ: Energy companies applauded the Pruitt nomination. Conservatives are happy, too. Shortly after Pruitt was elected, the Oklahoma AG created a brand new federalism unit devoted to fighting for more states' rights in court. Pruitt has sued the EPA and challenged rules on Mercury and cross-state air pollution and Obama's signature Clean Power Plan. DAVID GOLDSTON: Whatever they actually believe, the result is that they're protecting polluters. WERTZ: That's David Goldston with the National Resources Defense Council. GOLDSTON: It's one thing to say well, you don't think the federal government should do this or that. I mean he's gone further on climate and questioned whether there's actually a problem despite the clear consensus of scientists. WERTZ: Jody Freeman is the director of the environmental law program at Harvard Law. She also advised the Obama White House and is on the board at ConocoPhillips. She says EPA administrators get most of their power through setting program budgets and deciding which new programs to pursue or not pursue, and Pruitt would have wide discretion on enforcing environmental rules. JODY FREEMAN: And if he wants to slow down enforcement or treat the states more gently, be a little more lax, he can certainly try to do that. WERTZ: But Freeman says he couldn't just ignore rules, and she says courts are skeptical of dramatic changes. FREEMAN: You don't just eliminate a rule. There are legal procedures that prevent Cabinet heads from doing things with the stroke of a pen. WERTZ: Pruitt supporter Todd Hiett was a Republican speaker of the Oklahoma House when Pruitt was a state senator. He says Pruitt has a track record of building consensus and making deals on complicated environmental issues. TODD HIETT: He's going to be thorough. He's going to be fair. He's going to stay within the confines of the law. But at the same time, he's going to look for practical solutions. WERTZ: Pruitt declined an interview request. His predecessor in the Oklahoma AG's office, Democrat Drew Edmondson, thinks the EPA would be less proactive under Pruitt but not completely absent. DREW EDMONDSON: There are too many of us who remember what it was like when you couldn't see a skyline from five miles away because of smog. Nobody wants to return to that time. WERTZ: Including, he says, Scott Pruitt. For NPR News, I'm Joe Wertz in Oklahoma City. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"December 14, 2016",Trump's Men In Moscow: Trump Disciples Suddenly Showing Up In Russia," Donald Trump hasn't been inaugurated yet, but members of his campaign entourage are already riding the president-elect's coattails all the way to Moscow. On Monday, Jack Kingston, a former Trump surrogate, briefed American businesspeople in Russia on what they might expect from the incoming administration. Lifting Western sanctions that were imposed on Russia because of its armed intervention in Ukraine has become the top priority not only for the Kremlin but for foreign companies working in Moscow. During the campaign, Trump indicated he would reconsider those sanctions and suggested he would get along fine with Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""Trump can look at sanctions. They've been in place long enough,"" Kingston told NPR in Moscow. ""Has the desired result been reached? He doesn't have to abide by the Obama foreign policy. That gives him a fresh start."" Kingston said he had mostly met with businesspeople in Moscow and that there had been no meetings with Russian government officials or U.S. diplomats. Now was the time, he said, for business to step up and play a role in ""soft diplomacy."" Although Kingston traveled as a private individual, the former Georgia congressman's bio on the website of the American Chamber of Commerce in Russia didn't hide his connections to the stars of Team Trump such as Vice President-elect Mike Pence and campaign manager Kellyanne Conway. ""I was an active soldier in the foxhole, but not a general deploying troops,"" Kingston said about his role in the Trump campaign. By chance, Kingston's Moscow trip coincided with the visit of another Trump disciple, Carter Page, who once claimed to advise the Republican candidate on energy and Russia policy. The Trump campaign later distanced itself from Page after he came under scrutiny for his ties to Russia. On Monday, Page held a news conference at the headquarters of Sputnik, a Russian state-run news agency, where he complained about the proliferation of fake news. Page lamented the ""Cold War mindset"" in the U.S. and sang the praises of Rex Tillerson, the Exxon Mobil CEO who expanded his company's footprint in Russia and whom Trump now wants to be his secretary of state. Tillerson's last public appearance in Russia was in June during the St. Petersburg Economic Forum. When he was asked about the future of sanctions, Tillerson laughed and said only a U.S. government official could answer that question. The next time he comes to Russia, Tillerson may not be able to dodge that question quite so easily. NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor ",http://www.npr.org/505581348
npr,"December 14, 2016",Agency Pushes Back On Claim Trump Would Breach Hotel Lease Once He Takes Office," The General Services Administration is pushing back against House Democrats' contention that President-elect Donald Trump would be breaching his lease on his latest hotel in the Old Post Office Building once he takes the oath of office on Jan. 20. ""GSA does not have a position that the lease provision requires the President-elect to divest of his financial interests. We can make no definitive statement at this time about what would constitute a breach of the agreement, and to do so now would be premature,"" the government agency said in a statement. ""In fact, no determination regarding the Old Post Office can be completed until the full circumstances surrounding the President-elect's business arrangements have been finalized and he has assumed office,"" the statement continued. ""GSA is committed to responsibly administering all of the leases to which it is a party."" Four House Democrats on the Oversight Committee said in a letter Wednesday that the deputy commissioner of the GSA had told them that Trump would be in breach of his lease with the government for the new Trump International Hotel in D.C. That contract has a clause that specifies that no elected government official can be party to the lease. ""The Deputy Commissioner made clear that Mr. Trump must divest himself not only of managerial control, but of all ownership as well,"" Reps. Elijah Cummings, D-Md.; Peter DeFazio, D-Ore.; Gerry Connolly, D-Va.; and Andre Carson, D-Ind., wrote in the letter. The GSA, however, says it cannot determine whether occupying the Oval Office and being a part of the lease would constitute a breach until Trump officially takes office. But Cummings, the ranking member of the Oversight Committee, says, ""We understand GSA's position that this breach has not yet occurred, will not occur until Donald Trump is sworn in as president, and is officially viewed as a 'hypothetical' issue until that time. We also share GSA's hope that the agency will not have to address this issue if President-elect Trump divests his ownership in the lease before then. But the simple fact is that GSA informed our staffs that they interpret this lease provision as prohibiting any elected official from having any ownership interest in the lease, and we stand 100% behind our letter."" The president-elect has yet to outline how he plans to deal with his business interests and the many conflicts of interests arising as he prepares to enter the White House. Trump was slated to hold a news conference on Thursday to address that, but instead on Monday he postponed it until a yet-to-be specified date in January. Trump suggested Sunday in an interview with Fox News Sunday's Chris Wallace that he will not sell off his businesses to avoid conflicts of interest during his term, instead letting his adult children run them. But given the closeness of some of his children to his transition and eventual administration, there are still questions about conflicts from their involvement as well. In a letter on Tuesday, the U.S. Office of Government Ethics urged Trump to fully divest from his businesses, arguing that letting his children run the companies wasn't enough. Trump opened the luxury hotel to great fanfare just days before the election.

npr,"December 14, 2016",Fake News Expert On How False Stories Spread And Why People Believe Them," This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross. So do you remember reading that Hillary Clinton paid Jay Z and Beyonce $62 million dollars for performing at a rally in Cleveland before the election? You might have, but the story is false, one of many posted on hyper-partisan websites and spread by aggressive social media campaigns during the presidential election. Our guest, Craig Silverman, has spent much of his career as a journalist writing about issues of accuracy in media. He wrote a column for the Poynter Institute called Regret the Error and later a book of the same name on the harm done by erroneous reporting. He also launched a web-based startup called Emergent devoted to crowdsourcing the fact-checking of fake news. He's now the media editor for the website BuzzFeed, and he spent much of this year writing about fake news, rumors and conspiracy theories that gained currency in the presidential campaign - where they came from, why they got so much engagement on social media and what should be done to reduce their impact on public discourse. I spoke to Craig Silverman yesterday. Well, Craig Silverman, welcome to FRESH AIR. You did an analysis comparing how stories done by, you know, mainstream major news organizations like The New York Times, The Washington Post did it in terms of engagement on Facebook. You compared those stories to other stories done by essentially fake websites or fake election stories. What did you find? CRAIG SILVERMAN: Something pretty surprising. So what we did was we looked at 19 major media organizations and we found sort of the election content from them that had performed best on Facebook. And to kind of define what that means, Facebook doesn't give us a lot of data. That's I think one of the frustrations overall that a lot of researchers and other people have. But what Facebook will give you is one number for a piece of content that gives you the total count of the number of shares and comments and reactions for that one piece of content. And so what we did was we looked across 19 major media organizations and we picked out the best-performing stuff about the election. And then because I'd been looking at fake news for so long, I have lists of more than 50 websites that completely publish fake information. I looked at what had performed best from them about the election, and I also did some searches to try and find other things about conspiracy theories that I knew had spread. So at the end of the day, when we kind of looked at the numbers we saw that nine months before the election, six months before the election, the overall Facebook engagement for those top election stories from the mainstream outlets was greater than the fake news that was spreading. But when we went three months before the election, that critical time, we actually saw the fake news spike. And we saw the mainstream news engagement on Facebook for those top 20 stories decline. And so at the end of the day, in that critical moment, the fake news of those top 20 stories was getting more engagement on Facebook than some of the stories from the biggest media outlets in the U.S. And that was incredibly surprising. I didn't actually expect fake news to win out in that sense. DAVIES: So what does that tell us? SILVERMAN: Something was going on there where, one, you can conclude that the stuff that they were creating and spreading was really resonating with voters. But two, I think you also have to look at Facebook itself and wonder how is it that these sites that have for so long been so marginal, how is it that these sites that in many cases had only been launched in the previous, you know, six to 12 months, how is it possible that they're getting stuff out there on this massive platform, Facebook, that is getting more engagement than, you know, op-eds and commentary pieces from major media, than, you know, big stories about the Trump campaign, about the Clinton campaign? It just didn't make sense to me. But there's no question that these fake stories resonated with people. There's no question that they saw them and they shared them or they commented on them and they liked them, and that created tremendous velocity on Facebook. And a lot of people saw them, and that's a really surprising thing and it's a distressing thing. DAVIES: When you looked at the fake news stories, did they tend to help one side more than another? SILVERMAN: Yeah. Overwhelmingly, when you looked at the stories that performed really well on Facebook, they were pro-Trump or they were anti-Clinton. And that was a very clear trend. The stuff that was anti-Trump was just not getting the same traction. And so I think what happened is that a lot of people creating fake news looked at this and said, well, let's go all-in on Trump. DAVIES: You've discovered that there are more than a hundred websites peddling false news stories for the American voting public from a single town in Macedonia in the Balkans. Tell us about this place. Who's pushing this stuff? SILVERMAN: There's a town in central Macedonia called Veles, you know, population is roughly around 40 to 50,000 people. And, you know, to back up for a second, myself and a researcher named Lawrence Alexander were interested in pro-Trump movements outside of the United States and outside of North America. And so working with Lawrence, we kind of went from, you know, one European country in particular to the next to sort of see, you know, are there other pro-Trump Facebook pages? Are there pro-Trump websites? Who are the people running these? You know, what messaging are they using? We were interested in that element of it, and we were interested for a couple of reasons. The first reason is that a lot of pro-Trump content online was getting really good engagement. And so we figured that there might be people from other countries around the world who are sort of trying to grab a piece of that. And then the second piece was that we were interested to see if there were any other foreign entities that were helping push pro-Trump messaging outside of the U.S. And, obviously, one of the ones that comes to mind when you think about that would be Russia. Are there any sites pushing pro-Trump messaging in Europe that had connections perhaps to Russian interests? So we went looking and we found some sites in different places. And we found this small cluster initially in Macedonia, and that was sort of of interest. You know, why would people in Macedonia be running sites that seemed very pro-Trump in English? And we looked a little bit closer and did more research and we found that actually The Guardian months earlier had pointed to over a hundred websites about U.S. politics in this small town of Veles. So we did our own research and we turned up a number of 140 sites. And I went and I visited every single one of these 140 sites personally. And we started to build a spreadsheet to sort of see like, OK, so what kind of content are they publishing and do they lean right or left or do they seem kind of, you know, in the middle? And as I filled out the spreadsheet it became very clear that they were overwhelmingly pro-Trump. And as I visited the websites and read their content, I saw that a lot of the stuff that they were pushing was misleading, was to the extreme of partisanship and also occasionally was false. And so we dug in even more and realized that among the top shared articles from, you know, these range of sites, the majority of, like, the top five were actually completely false. So at that point, once we understood the content that they were publishing and how many there were, we really wanted to understand so who are the people behind these sites? DAVIES: OK, so you got in contact with these folks. Who were they? SILVERMAN: Yeah, I shot out a lot of emails. You know, the sites that we had found, we found sort of who was registered as the owner of the sites. And most people didn't respond to me. Some people got back to me and politely declined saying that they weren't interested in talking to me. But a few people through email or through finding them on Facebook and talking to them did speak to me. And one of the things that stood out right away was that a lot of them were very young. In fact, a lot of the people I spoke to were still in their teens or in their 20s and in university. And, you know, the biggest question is why. You know, why run politics sites, why pro-Trump politics sites and how would a teenager in Macedonia think to do this? And I think there were probably still some unanswered questions there. But the answer that they always gave me was that, you know, it was simply for money. There are a lot of sites run out of Veles, run out of Macedonia in general that we found. In particular, there's a huge cluster of websites in English about health issues because they find that that content does really well. And if they sign up, for example, for Google AdSense, an ad program, they can get money as people visit their sites and it's pretty straightforward. So they tried election sites, and over time they all came to realize that the stuff that did the best was pro-Trump stuff. They got the most traffic and most traction. DAVIES: So these are young people, teenagers in some cases, who aren't driven by ideology. They're making a buck. Do they make money from doing well on Facebook? SILVERMAN: Facebook directly doesn't really earn them a lot of money. But the key thing about Facebook - and this is true whether you're running a politics site out of Macedonia or whether you run a very large website in the U.S. - Facebook is the biggest driver of traffic to, you know, news websites in the world now. You know, 1.8 billion people log into Facebook every month. And they'll... DAVIES: They see stuff they like, they hit the link and they go to the site, right? SILVERMAN: That's it. And so the key thing there is you have to get your content onto Facebook. You have to get in front of people so that they start sharing it and clicking on it. And so Facebook is the driver. And what we've found in subsequent investigations was that a lot of the folks running these sites in Macedonia also have these - sometimes they're creating or buying fake Facebook accounts which they then use to go online and to drop links to the stories on their websites into, for example, pro-Trump Facebook groups that exist online. Maybe they have thousands or tens of thousands of members. If you put your story in there, hopefully you're going to get some clicks. And so that's what they were doing. They were using Facebook to drive the traffic to the website where they had ads from Google and where they would earn money from that traffic. DAVIES: Right. Now, these young people in Macedonia I don't expect know enough about American politics to produce convincing fake election stories. Where were they getting the content? SILVERMAN: This is, again, one of the key things you wonder because, I mean, the English of some of the folks that I interviewed, you know, was OK, but not enough for them to kind of create this content themself. And so as we were looking at the sites, we realized that, you know, if you, for example, would place the headline for a particular article on a Macedonian site in Google, you would probably find that exact headline on a site run out of the U.S. maybe a day or two earlier. And so in the end, what they were doing was paying attention to the content that was doing well on Facebook, you know, looking in those pro-Trump Facebook groups to see what people were sharing. And then they would, you know, copy that text completely or just kind of pick a little piece out of it and link back. And so it was a very easy thing for them to do. They didn't have to come up with stories. They certainly weren't doing reporting. They were kind of copying and pasting and getting their stuff onto Facebook. And the key here is it speaks to kind of what happens on Facebook, which is that it doesn't matter who necessarily created the story first. It matters who was able to get it to move the most on Facebook. That's who would earn the most money. DAVIES: So these guys figured out there was money to be made from pushing this. When you talked to them, did you say hey, this isn't true, voters are being misinformed? Did they care? SILVERMAN: There wasn't a huge amount of concern over that. And I think part of it is that, you know, Veles, it's a small place. It's - economically, it's not doing very well. Used to be heavy industry there. A lot of those jobs are gone now. And I think there was an element almost - in some of the people I was speaking to, there was almost an element of pride saying, you know, we're here in this small country that most Americans probably don't even think about, and we're able to, you know, put stuff out and earn money and to run a business. And I think there was a bit of pride in that. One of the people that I spoke to, who was a bit older - he was in his 20s - you know, he said that yeah, I mean, people know that a lot of the content is false. But that's what works. And that's, again, one of the really big takeaways, I think, from this election, is - and I heard this not only from people in Macedonia, but from people in the U.S. who run very large - what people sort of refer to as hyper-partisan conservative Facebook pages. You know, meaning that their content is very, very slanted and very much appealing to their core audience there. They all said that when it came down to it, the fake stuff performed better on Facebook. And if you weren't doing some stuff that was misleading or fake, you were going to get beat by people who were. DAVIES: You actually did an analysis where you looked at the accuracy of stories done by hyper-partisan sites on the right, hyper-partisan sites on the left and mainstream sites. What did you find about how well accurate stuff played and how well false stuff played? SILVERMAN: So a team of us at BuzzFeed, you know, we spent seven consecutive weekdays looking at all of the posts that went up on the Facebook pages of a selection of, as you said, pages on the right, pages on the left. And then we also looked at three mainstream pages as well as kind of, you know, a base of comparison. And what we found overall is that the content that performed best was - you know, fell into two categories. So one is - was sort of misleading or false completely. That would get high engagement, meaning high shares on Facebook. That's - we really zeroed in on shares because that's how you drive the most traffic. And then the other type of content that performed really well was, you know, memes, like a photo that just sort - kind of expressed a very partisan opinion. These - you know, they weren't necessarily factually based, but they really kind of riled up the base. And for the pages that were partisan pages on the right and the left, if you had stuff that really appealed to people's existing beliefs - really appealed to, you know, a negative perception of Hillary Clinton, a negative perception of Donald Trump - even if it, you know, completely bent the truth, that would perform much better than a sort of purely factual thing. And when we looked at the performance of the mainstream pages, you know, the engagement for the partisan pages was much better. And I don't think that's only because we did find false and misleading stuff on the partisan pages. I think it's also because frankly, you know, the mainstream pages weren't posting as many memes. They weren't posting as many videos. And that stuff does really well on Facebook. It's strange, but you would think the media - big media companies are better at kind of running their Facebook pages. But honestly, these partisan pages on the right and the left were just much better at understanding what does well on Facebook. DAVIES: Craig Silverman is the media editor for BuzzFeed. We'll continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're talking about fake news in the presidential campaign with BuzzFeed media editor Craig Silverman. When we left off, we were talking about BuzzFeed's analysis of how false, highly partisan content did better on Facebook than stories reported by mainstream media. SILVERMAN: So at the core of this is - there's two factors that are at play here. So one is a human factor and one is kind of a platform or algorithmic factor. So on the human side, there's a lot of research out there going back a very long time that looks at sort of how humans deal with information. And one of the things that we love as humans - and this this affects all of us. We shouldn't think of this as just being something for people who are very partisan. We love to hear things that confirm what we think and what we feel and what we already believe. It's - it makes us feel good to get information that aligns with what we already believe or what we want to hear. And on the other side of that is when we're confronted with information that contradicts what we think and what we feel, the reaction isn't to kind of sit back and consider it. The reaction is often to double down on our existing beliefs. So if you're feeding people information that basically just tells them what they want to hear, they're probably going to react strongly to that. And the other layer that these pages are very good at is they bring in emotion into it, anger or hate or surprise or, you know, joy. And so if you combine information that aligns with their beliefs, if you can make it something that strikes an emotion in them, then that gets them to react. And that's where the kind of platform and algorithms come in. Which is that on Facebook, you know, the more you interact with certain types of content, the more its algorithms are going to feed you more of that content. So if you're reading stuff that aligns perfectly with your political beliefs, it makes you feel really good and really excited and you share it, Facebook is going to see that as a signal that you want more of that stuff. So that's why the false misleading stuff does really well is because it's highly emotion-driven. It tells people exactly what they want to hear. It makes them feel very comforted and it gets them to react on the platform. And the platform sees that content does really well and Facebook feeds more of it to more people. DAVIES: There are plenty of stories that debunk inaccurate information and you looked at how they do. How do they compare to the false stories? SILVERMAN: They don't, unfortunately. And this goes back to a research project I did a couple of years ago where I was really very focused, one, on the spread of rumors and misinformation online and two, also how media organizations deal with this new world where it's very easy for something, you know, that's simply a tweet claiming something to suddenly get huge exposure and huge distribution. And the same obviously happens on Facebook on an even bigger scale. So when you're a journalist and you see something out there, you're not sure whether it's true or false, how do you deal with it? Do you wait and do your work? Or because potentially millions of people have already seen it, do you kind of write about it? So I did a research project where we kind of identified rumors that we saw out there. We looked at how media coverage was of it. And this is how I started to encounter a lot of fake news stories and started to realize that there were entire websites that existed that just had completely fake stuff. So when I would see that completely fake stuff circulating, I would - we would look at the Facebook and other types of social engagement for it. And then we would also try to find any debunking of it from Snopes or from other sources. And honestly during that research project, we really only found I think one example where the debunkings (ph) actually had actually gotten more engagement on social, and in particular Facebook, than the false information. DAVIES: It's just not as much fun? SILVERMAN: Yeah. There's a few things going on there. And again, psychology comes into it a little bit. So one, when people create the false stuff and if they're smart about it - if I put it that way - you know, they know that it needs to appeal to emotion. They know that maybe if it can have a sense of urgency, if it can be tied to things people care about, that's probably going to do well in terms of fake stuff. Whereas when you come in as the debunker, what you're doing is actively going against information that people are probably already, you know, willing to believe and that gets them emotionally. And to tell somebody I'm sorry that thing you saw and shared is not true is you coming in in a very negative way unfortunately. And so the reaction is often for people to get defensive and to disagree with you. And just in general you just seem like kind of a spoil sport. You're ruining the fun or you're getting in the way of their beliefs. And a lot of times when I put debunkings out there, you know, some of the reactions I get are people saying, well, it might as well be true. You know, he could have said that or that could have happened. Or, of course, you get accusations that, you know, you're biased. And so the debunkings just don't appeal as much to us on a psychological level. There's some emotional resistance to wanting to be wrong. That's a very natural human thing. And they're just not as shareable because the emotion there isn't as real and raw as something that makes you angry, for example. DAVIES: Craig Silverman is media editor for BuzzFeed. After a break, he'll talk about how Facebook handles fake news and what it might do better. I'm Dave Davies and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross. We're speaking with BuzzFeed media editor Craig Silverman about the spread of fake news in the presidential campaign. Silverman spent a lot of this year investigating fake news, reporting that a torrent of false web stories came from a small town in Macedonia and discovering that late in the campaign fake news did better on Facebook than stories from mainstream media sources. As the campaign proceeded, did the campaigns themselves or Donald Trump through his tweets have any role in building an audience for these fake news stories? SILVERMAN: Yeah. I think the Trump campaign was so remarkable for so many reasons when we talk about this specific area. So the first that I think needs to be mentioned is that, you know, the Trump campaign itself helped circulate false news stories, 100 percent fake news stories from 100 percent fake news websites. DAVIES: Give us an example. SILVERMAN: So the one that comes to mind right away, this is a story that was on a website that is made to look like ABC News but its domain is slightly different. And the story that was published, you know, long before the election claimed that a protester had been paid $3,500 to go and protest at Trump rally. And this fed into perceptions that the people who are against Trump were being paid by big interests. And that story did pretty well on Facebook. It got a fair amount of engagement. But it was tweeted by Eric Trump. It was tweeted by Corey Lewandowski, who was a campaign manager for Donald Trump, and it was tweeted by Kellyanne Conway, who was his campaign manager, not that long before the election. So when you have people in positions of power and influence putting out fake news - and I want to say, you know, there's no evidence that they knew it was fake and put it out there to fool people. I think in each case they genuinely believed it was true because, as we've discussed, I think it fed into the message their campaign wanted to put out. And it's really kind of unprecedented to think of people that high in a campaign actively putting out misinformation and it happening from several people. You would have thought that after one or two of them did it, you people would have talked to them. So that piece is really, really remarkable. The other one that I think has to be mentioned is that Donald Trump, on a very frequent basis throughout the campaign and now that he is the president-elect, says things that are not true and things that are demonstrably false. And when you have somebody who is in that position of power, with that amount of influence, with that amount of people who are very passionate about him and what they think he can bring to the country, putting out false information - you know, I think it lays the groundwork for other false information to get out there. And it creates a fertile environment for folks to start kind of making things up because the door is wide open. And I think that there is something unique about the Trump campaign in that respect. DAVIES: Did you see any of this kind of activity among Democrats? SILVERMAN: So there certainly was false information circulating that was, you know, anti-Trump or pro-Clinton. I certainly can't think of an example from the Clinton campaign of them actively falling for fake news or what have you. But there's no question that there were things that were false that spread about Donald Trump. I can think of one meme that I saw where people had misquoted him. One that was really popular actually was one that falsely claimed he had given a quote to People magazine many years ago basically saying that if I ever ran for president, I would run as a Republican because conservatives are so stupid they'll believe anything. And this was turned into a meme. It spread a lot on Facebook. It was debunked so many times. We debunked it at BuzzFeed. Snopes has debunked it. And it just kept going and going and going because this is something I think a lot of Democrats wanted to believe. But it also has to be said, I mean, all of the analysis that we've done about misinformation related to the election has shown that pro-Trump misinformation and anti-Clinton misinformation far outperformed anything that came from the other side. DAVIES: Do we have any idea what the effect of this was on this election? Has anybody tried to figure out how many minds were changed, how many votes might have been affected? SILVERMAN: I don't think anybody's going to get a definitive answer on that. It's really tough to conclude the effect of media on people's voting habits because there are so many factors. But - so I think anyone who believes that fake news won Trump the election is wrong. There's no data to support that. And I say this as somebody who's been looking at this data in a lot of different ways. There's no smoking gun. There's - I don't think we'll ever get it. But when we look at some of the data about the impact of misinformation, it's really significant. So we at BuzzFeed partnered with Ipsos to do a survey of 3,000 Americans. And one of the things we wanted to find out was their familiarity with fake news headlines about the election. And what we found in the end after testing a group of five fake news headlines that went really big during the election and six real news headlines that went really big during the election is that 75 percent of the time, the Americans who were shown a fake news headline and had remembered it from the election believed it to be accurate. And that's a really shocking thing. It's impossible to go the next step and say, well, they voted because of that. But I think one of the things this election has shown is that people will believe fake news, misinformation will spread and people will believe it and it will become part of their worldview. DAVIES: Yeah, but did I hear that right, three quarters of us will believe a fake headline, think it's true? SILVERMAN: This is - this was a pretty high number, a shocking number. And that number is based on more than 1,500 judgments about fake news headlines from people in this sample of 3,000 people. So it's a pretty good sample size. It's not definitive, but it's a high number. And it is shocking because, I mean, for example, one of these headlines that we tested claimed that Hillary Clinton had been proven to have sold weapons to ISIS. I mean, that was one of the headlines and people did believe that. DAVIES: We're speaking with Craig Silverman. He is the media editor for BuzzFeed. We'll continue our conversation after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And we're speaking with Craig Silverman. He is the media editor for BuzzFeed. He's been writing about accuracy in reporting and fact-checking for many years. And he spent a lot of time this election season writing about fake news. Let's talk about Facebook's role here. Now, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has said a number of different things about this. At one point, he said, you know, we're a tech company, not a media company. And that's what Facebook does - right? - it allows millions of people to share content and is kind of reluctant maybe to regulate it. What have its own policies done to propagate or limit the spread of false information? SILVERMAN: One of the core things that Facebook does or I suppose what it doesn't do as much as it can tries to not act as kind of a censor or a control point on what people are sharing. And I think overall, you know, that's a good thing. I don't want Facebook deciding whether what I put up is good enough to be shown to other people or not. And this goes into what you mentioned about it sees itself as a platform, meaning it's a place where you can put stuff out and they help it reach lots of people and help you connect with other people. But, of course, that cuts both ways. So me sharing stuff about my family, me sharing news stories I've read that I care about can get just as much attention and can move just as easily as somebody who's consciously created something false and is working to get it to spread on Facebook. So the platform mentality creates the opportunity there. And the scale of Facebook, which I think people should never get comfortable with how big it is because it's unlike anything in human history. There are almost 2 billion people logging in every month around the world. We've never had a communications system where people are connected in this way that has reached that amount of scale. And so I think along with, you know, the platform mentality, there's also the scale piece of it that is a huge factor in false information spreading because there's just so many people there. And there's so much potential for information to move and to spread. And Facebook at the scale it's at to a certain extent I feel is almost unknowable. You can't even fathom understanding what's happening on it at any given moment. I think that's not only true for us, but it's also true for them because I think from what we've seen Mark Zuckerberg say, I think he's been really taken aback by what happened, to be honest. DAVIES: Taken aback by the volume of fake news stories that spread during the election, you mean? SILVERMAN: Yeah. I mean, his first comments were very dismissive. You know, the first thing he said publicly about it was at a tech conference and he talked about it being, you know, just a crazy idea that fake news had an effect on the election. And, you know, I agree with him. I'm not ready to say that fake news decided the election for Trump. But I also think that completely dismissing, you know, the growing evidence that we have that fake news got huge, huge engagement on his platform, you know, it doesn't make any sense. And he got a lot of blowback for that comment. And I think over time they have come to realize inside Facebook that, you know, this is actually a big issue. And they faced a lot of criticism. And now, you know, the most recent thing from Mark Zuckerberg is they announced seven things they're going to do to try and reduce the spread of misinformation on their platform. DAVIES: What are they? And do you think they're effective? SILVERMAN: So one of the things that they're going to do, for example, is to make it easier for average users of Facebook if they see something that's false to be able to kind of flag it and say, hey, this is a false piece of content and signal to Facebook that this is something that you don't want to see but also something that they should look at and prevent from spreading further. Now, that's a feature that actually already exists in some ways. The problem is that it's very hidden. So they want to make that a little more evident for people. And I think that's a good thing. The downside as always is that how many people are going to use that? And would people use it to kind of flag stuff they simply just disagree with rather than things that are false? They've also acknowledged that there's a role of their algorithms in this. And they're looking at ways of having algorithms be able to recognize stuff that might be misinformation. And that may sound like a simple thing to say. It's incredibly complicated to do. And I've spoken to a lot of researchers who were very focused in this area of trying to automatically identify misinformation or automatically identify rumors and there is no algorithm that exists today that can do that at a high level of accuracy. So the opportunity is for Facebook to really do huge amounts of leadership in this area and do some innovation. The downside is for them to hand too much over to an algorithm that starts suppressing free speech and suppressing other things it's not supposed to. One of the last things he mentioned that's probably worth noting is they've announced that they are not going to allow fake news websites to have access to the advertising tools on Facebook. So if you run a fake news website, they're going to try and stop you from, for example, paying to promote that post to more people on Facebook. And that's a good thing. And I think if we can cut off some of the financial incentives around fake news, that overall it can be quite powerful. DAVIES: Right. And, of course, that requires somebody to make a judgment about what a fake new site is. SILVERMAN: Yeah. Now, this is where things are getting very tricky. And as much as we talk about algorithms when we talk about Facebook, you know, there are humans who are involved in the review of content. When you flag something as offensive on Facebook, it's possible that it may automatically then be scanned by an algorithm and realize that that is an image, for example, maybe they've already banned. But a lot of the time it ends up in front of a person on their content review team who has to make a judgment call. And I can tell you from speaking to people in conservative media, they are extremely concerned. One, they view Facebook as a liberal organization. They think it's biased against conservative points of view. And two, they're extremely concerned that if Facebook starts trying to weed out fakes, they're going to have people with a liberal point of view who disagree with an article potentially suppressing it. And so there is risk now of suppression of free speech and suppression of different points of view if these things were to go in the wrong direction. DAVIES: Do you have a view yourself about what they should be doing? SILVERMAN: You know, the first thing in terms of what should be done is that - is the answer is kind of a lot of things. And that's an unsatisfying answer to give, but it speaks to the complexity of this problem. When people started circulating lists of fake news websites, it was a huge problem because a lot of the sites on those lists, sure, they may publish some stuff that's misleading or false but they weren't publishing stuff a hundred percent in those areas. And there were a lot of simply ideologically-driven sites that were on these lists. And so if, for example, Facebook wanted to just implement a big bad blacklist, get rid of lots of sites, that would be a terrible, terrible outcome. So it's not as simple as I think some people have suggested it can be. I would like to see them make flagging more of - more easy for people and to make sure that it can't be abused. I think they absolutely need to innovate in the area of algorithmic detection of misinformation. I also think, frankly, they do need to increase the amount of people who are reviewing content, whether it's for being offensive or other things because the scale of their platform is so big that I don't think they've put the human element in there in the right places. So them figuring out where that can be applied and how to guard against ideologically-driven decisions is a big thing. And to be honest, I think that they should figure out ways to identify the sites that are a hundred percent fake news and to see how they're sharing. Are they just being shared among small groups of people who all sort of think the same way and realize that that probably isn't a story that should spread further. So I'm not a huge proponent of blacklists but I think that analyzing the content and knowing what it is and knowing how it's being shared is really important. The other unsexy thing finally, I think, is that we need to put this in our education system. There are a lot of people being fooled by fake news. There are a lot of people who don't know how to kind of check out the story they're reading online and that's understandable. It's not a matter of intelligence. We're consuming media in very different ways. We're having a whole menu of links and things from all different kinds of sources fed to us every day by Facebook. And that's very different from opening up a newspaper and knowing where everything was coming from. So I think we do in our schools need to start thinking about how we integrate more media literacy and critical thinking education so that people can make better judgments for themselves. DAVIES: What's Google's role in all of this? SILVERMAN: Well, Google is in a lot of ways the financial engine for fake news. And similar to Facebook, Google is - considers itself a technology company, not a media company, and considers itself in many ways a platform, which means they're not there, you know, to decide what should or shouldn't be published. They're there to facilitate these things. The biggest piece for Google - aside from obviously the search element which can send a lot of traffic to these sites - the biggest piece is AdSense, which is their very big advertising network, which you can sign up for very quickly. If you put up a website and you've got some content on it and you submit to AdSense to apply to put ads on it, you can get approved relatively quickly. They do review the site to see if it goes against any of their terms of service. But once you have the ads up there, that's how you make the money. And I have to say, I mean, the vast majority of the fake news websites and kind of dubious websites that I come across are running AdSense. And oftentimes they're doing things that are in direct opposition to the terms of service that Google says it applies to the sites that are supposed to be in that program. DAVIES: How would they violate Google's terms of service? SILVERMAN: Well, let's take the Macedonian sites as an example. One of the things that Google looks for in approving a site for AdSense is that they're adding value in some way. So if you, for example, set up a site and all you did was copy and paste content from other sites and you added nothing to it, you should not be approved for AdSense. But that's what a lot of the Macedonia's sites that I looked at were doing. They were either completely plagiarizing or just quickly taking from elsewhere and copying it almost completely. There's no reason why those sites should have been approved. They violate Google's own terms of service for AdSense, and they just shouldn't be able to make money that way, but they do. And so these review processes, whether it's Facebook, you know, trying to review a piece of content to figure out whether it's false or offensive or Google trying to figure out whether a site is in line with its advertising standards, you know, there's always going to be mistakes. There's always going to be things that slip through cracks because when you're a platform, you have reached such massive scale that it's very hard to do quality control.

npr,"December 14, 2016",How Fast Could GOP Congress Get Obamacare Repeal To Trump's Desk?," House Majority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., is part of the Republican leadership working to repeal the Affordable Care Act as quickly as possible in January. Republicans in Congress are so eager to repeal the Affordable Care Act that some have vowed to get a bill to President-elect Donald Trump's desk on the day he takes the oath of office. ""We will move right after the first of the year on an Obamacare repeal resolution,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told reporters at a news conference Monday. But could lawmakers introduce and pass a repeal measure in the 17 days between Jan. 3, when they convene, and Inauguration Day, Jan. 20? Not likely, say budget specialists. ""No way. I just don't think it's possible,"" says G. William Hoagland, senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington-based think tank and 20-year Republican staff veteran of the Senate Budget Committee. Others think it could be done, but probably won't be. ""Mechanically they can get it done,"" says Ed Lorenzen, senior adviser to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. ""The bigger question is, can they decide what should be in the package?"" Republicans and the incoming Trump administration have been careful not to talk about exactly what they plan to do to the Affordable Care Act beyond repealing virtually all of its coverage expansions and the taxes that help fund them. But they seem to be coalescing around a strategy of repeal and delay, in which they would pass a bill to kill many of the major provisions of law by a certain date, then set to work on crafting and passing a replacement before that date arrives. It would be quicker for Congress to simply repeal the health law outright. But Republicans can't do that, because they would need 60 votes in the Senate to fend off Democrats' delaying tactics, and they will have only 52 GOP members. So instead they will be limited to using a special budget strategy that will let them pass their bill with 51 votes. That's called budget reconciliation, and the strategy does not let lawmakers repeal the entire law — only the parts that directly impact federal spending. It's been widely discussed as something the Republicans might attempt, but there has been less focus on how long the process takes. No one in Congress can simply introduce a budget reconciliation bill. The word ""reconciliation"" refers to the process by which congressional committees that control permanent spending programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, as well as tax policy, take action to reconcile that spending with the terms of the annual budget resolution. That means the first action must be to pass a budget resolution, which Congress failed to do last year. That is the resolution McConnell was referring to in his Monday remarks to reporters. The budget resolution, which is essentially a planning document for spending and taxes for the coming fiscal year, does not go to the president for a signature. But like a regular bill, it does have to be passed by both the House and Senate in the same form. And while the budget resolution also may not be filibustered in the Senate, lawmakers have up to 50 hours to debate it and unlimited time to vote on proposed amendments, which in practice can take up to another full day. Once that measure is agreed to by the full House and Senate, the action moves back to congressional committees. The budget resolution often includes reconciliation instructions to committees. Those instructions order proposed legislative changes to the programs the committees oversee, to meet the terms of the budget. That process triggers the reconciliation bill that goes to the president. In the normal course of events, those changes take from several weeks to several months to accomplish. Legislative changes need to be written, voted on by the committee and reported back to the House or Senate budget committees, which then forward them to the House or Senate floor for votes. Again, Senate debate is limited to 20 hours, with unlimited additional voting on amendments. House and Senate negotiators then hammer out a compromise, pass it again in the full House and Senate and send it to the president. The last budget reconciliation bill, considered a dry run by Republicans for the coming year, was launched by the budget resolution at the end of April 2015. The resulting reconciliation bill was sent to President Obama, who vetoed it, on Jan. 26, 2016. Clearly, if Republicans were to simply recycle their 2015 bill, the process could be dramatically shortened. That bill called for repeal of funding for Medicaid expansion, as well as for jettisoning subsidies of health insurance premiums and other items that help individuals afford private coverage, along with the taxes to pay for those benefits, as of Dec. 31, 2017. Predictions of getting the reconciliation bill to the president by Inauguration Day are ambitious, according to Stan Collender, executive vice president of Qorvis MSLGROUP, a Washington communications and consulting firm. ""It would be unprecedented to do it that quickly,"" says Collender, who has worked for both the House and Senate budget committees. ""But just because it hasn't worked that expeditiously before doesn't mean they can't do it."" While Jan. 20 might not be feasible, ""I think they could do it by the end of January,"" says Lorenzen. He notes that while some Republicans in the Senate have been expressing doubts about repealing the law without having a replacement in hand, and others in the House object to leaving current policies in place for as long as three years, ""no one want to be the skunk that stops repeal."" But others think that even with a model bill in hand, the process will be harder — and take longer — than many Republicans are saying. With last year's bill, ""That repeal legislation, they knew they weren't shooting with real bullets,"" says Hoagland of the Bipartisan Policy Center. ""They knew it was going to be vetoed."" Already, health analysts and health provider groups are warning that repealing major pieces of the law without immediately replacing them could cause a collapse of the individual insurance market that currently covers around 20 million people. The risk of that collapse could — and should — slow things down, says Chris Jennings, a health consultant who worked in both the Bill Clinton and Obama administrations. ""Few people have ever been wrong projecting that Congress takes a little bit longer"" than some predictions, he says. ""I think this health debate is of such consequence, that will likely be the case for this as well."" Shots is the online channel for health stories from the NPR Science Desk.

npr,"December 14, 2016",Trump Taps Rick Perry To Head Energy Department," Let's talk next about President-elect Trump's choice for secretary of energy. Rick Perry, the former governor of Texas, is that choice. And NPR's Scott Horsley is here to talk about it. Hi, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: Didn't Rick Perry once call for eliminating the Department of Energy? HORSLEY: That's right, Steve. When he ran for president four years ago, Rick Perry wanted to eliminate not only the Energy Department, but also the departments of Commerce and Education. Energy is the department he had trouble remembering during that awkward televised debate. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RICK PERRY: The third agency of government I would - I would do away with - the Education, the Commerce... And let's see - I can't. The third one - I can't, sorry... Oops. (LAUGHTER) HORSLEY: It was an oops moment that effectively ended Perry's presidential campaign. He made a second run at the White House in this cycle, but that was short-lived. He did, however, like a lot of fallen celebrities, win a measure of redemption competing on ""Dancing With The Stars."" INSKEEP: OK. I just have to ask - I mean, it's not fair to judge somebody by one screw-up, even on television like that. But this is someone that Trump himself, when they were candidates against each other, mocked for his lack of smarts and said he was wearing glasses to try to look smart. Does Trump believe now that Rick Perry actually is smart? HORSLEY: In his official announcement this morning, it was very effusive, and no crack about the glasses. Instead, the Trump team highlighted Rick Perry's role as the chief executive of one of the biggest states in - and one of the biggest economies in the country. Of course, Perry led Texas. He's the longest-serving governor of that state. He led Texas for most of this century. And it's true, Texas has enjoyed a generally strong economy during that period, thanks in part to its energy industries, especially oil and natural gas. We should say Rick Perry also embraced wind energy. There's a lot of wind in Texas, and it's become a leader in that field. But as our Texas-based colleague Wade Goodwyn said, it's really the oil and gas industries that Rick Perry loves. And they love him right back. INSKEEP: Well, let's try to understand what the Department of Energy does. Aren't they more about nuclear materials and nuclear weapons than about oil and gas? How's it work exactly? And what do they do? HORSLEY: It is a big department, and it does have responsibility for managing America's nuclear stockpile. The last two energy secretaries, under President Obama, have been eminent scientists. Steven Chu, President Obama's first energy secretary, was a Nobel Prize winner. He helped - with the help of money from the stimulus fund, Steven Chu really helped turn the Energy Department into sort of a venture capitalist for clean energy development. Chu also was notable for helping BP during that disastrous oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. The current energy secretary, Ernie Moniz, was a top scientist at MIT. His grasp of nuclear physics made Moniz a key player in brokering the Iran nuclear deal. INSKEEP: Oh, yeah, that's right. HORSLEY: Rick Perry would be a very different sort of energy secretary. He is someone who has questioned the scientific consensus surrounding climate change. And in fact, the Trump energy - the Trump transition team at the Energy Department has been raising questions, asking for names of Energy Department staffers and contractors who took part in climate meetings around the country. There is a real fear that that could cast a chilling effect over the agency and the incoming administration. There's a suspicion that maybe the incoming administration wants to carry out some sort of ideological purge at the Energy Department. Just yesterday, the department said it would not be turning over the names of those individual staffers. INSKEEP: Let me pose a question that I know to be getting asked here and there on Capitol Hill, as some of these Cabinet appointments have been rolled out. Are people being named to run agencies, or close them down? That's the question. In this case, it's a guy who actually said he wanted to close the agency down once upon a time. HORSLEY: Certainly if you look at a lot of the Trump Cabinet picks, these are people who have very strong philosophical differences with the agencies they're being assigned to run. If they don't close them down, they're certainly going to try to move those agencies and departments in a very different direction. INSKEEP: Interesting times. Scott, thanks very much, as always. HORSLEY: My pleasure, Steve. INSKEEP: That's NPR's Scott Horsley, giving us some background on Rick Perry, the former Texas governor and former presidential candidate, now President-elect Trump's designee for secretary of energy.

npr,"December 14, 2016",An Obama-Backed Change At Voice Of America Has Trump Critics Worried," A new law is raising concern that the journalistic independence of Voice of America and other federal broadcasters could be compromised by a future White House eager to market itself abroad. The federally funded Voice of America — and its affiliated broadcasters such as Radio Martí, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Radio Free Asia — is intended to provide reliable news reports in multiple languages to countries that lack a viable independent media and to promote democratic values abroad. The new law strips away the presidentially appointed bipartisan Broadcasting Board of Governors. The broadcasters instead would answer to a chief executive nominated by the president and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. The Obama administration embraced the change, promoted by congressional Republicans before the November elections. It was passed earlier this month by the Republican-controlled House and Senate as part of a much larger and essentially unrelated bill, which awaits Obama's signature or veto. The board was intended to insulate the broadcasters' journalists from political interference, but management by part-time, nonresident board members proved unwieldy; last year the board appointed a former Scripps executive, John Lansing, as CEO with day-to-day responsibilities. The new law's formalization of the structural shift, to an advisory board with a CEO directly appointed by the president, was seen as a way to ensure the broadcasters could function more smoothly. But the election of Donald Trump, whose attitude toward the press veers wildly depending on the favorability of the treatment he receives, has left some supporters of the venerable broadcaster worried. Critics, such as Democratic board member Michael Kempner, charge that the Obama administration and Congress are handing Trump new propaganda tools with a vast international reach. For decades, the international U.S. broadcasters were not allowed to present their programs to the United States, but that ban was lifted in 2013, accentuating the concerns of what a Trump administration might bring. ""Congress unwittingly just gave President-elect Trump unchecked control of all U.S. media outlets,"" Kempner told Politico. ""No president, either Democrat or Republican, should have that kind of control. It's a public jewel. Its independence is what makes it so credible."" The Washington Post's editorial board, suggesting Trump could appoint the head of Breitbart News as the broadcasting CEO, wrote, ""If Congress's intention was for U.S. broadcasting to rival the Kremlin's, it may well get its wish."" In the past, the promise of journalistic independence could be found in a firewall preventing meddling by political figures. The U.S. secretary of state sits on the nine-member Broadcasting Board of Governors or assigns someone to do so by dint of his or her position. A spokeswoman for the board said in a statement to NPR that the legislation makes no change to the statutory protections afforded the federal broadcasters. ""The CEO now is legally required to abide by and oversee the firewall,"" the spokeswoman said. ""It is the job of the news directors, editors and broadcasters, under the strict journalistic standards spelled out in the U.S. International Broadcasting Act of 1994, to determine the stories that get covered."" Amanda Bennett, director of the nearly 75-year-old Voice of America, says journalists in her newsroom take great pride in that promise. ""I really value this as a neutral, credible, objective, nonpolitical news organization, and I want to make sure we do everything possible to keep it that way,"" Bennett tells NPR. ""I also presume that everybody else does, too. I am comfortable that this country values what we do.""

npr,"December 14, 2016",Should Trump Foes See Tillerson At State As Last Straw Or First Ray Of Hope?," Several of Donald Trump's Cabinet choices have prompted controversy from the moment they were named, but the one most likely to face real Senate opposition is Rex Tillerson, the CEO of ExxonMobil, whom Trump wants as his secretary of state. How badly did Trump want Tillerson on his team? Badly enough to defend his pick's remarkable profile as a Russophile, a reputation so vivid that several Republican senators immediately began flashing yellow cards — if not red. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said being a ""Friend of Vladimir"" was hardly a Cabinet qualification, a reference to Russian President Putin, who once gave Tillerson the ""Order of Friendship"" — the highest accolade Moscow grants to friendly foreigners. Arizona Sen. John McCain went farther, calling Putin a ""murderer, a thug and a KGB agent,"" a reference to the Russian leader's early career with the Soviet Union's secret police. So was he calling Tillerson a friend of murderers, thugs and KGB agents? South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham added his grave doubts, as well, suggesting there might be enough Republican defections from the GOP's 52-seat majority to block the nomination on the Senate floor. This much at least is clear: For all the shade that has been thrown on other Trump Cabinet picks — from the generals to the Goldman Sachs alumni club — none seems in as much danger of Senate rejection as the big guy from the Big Oil company. Trump no doubt knew he would catch flak over Tillerson's Putin ties, but saw them as proof of the Texan's deal-making and globe-trotting savvy. And he was settled enough on his man to stand by him even after the story had broken about the CIA concluding the Russians interfered with the 2016 election with an eye to aiding Trump. Under these extraordinary circumstances, many will see the Tillerson pick as Trump doubling down on a potentially explosive departure from Republican orthodoxy. The party that nominated Trump has never been at ease with his defense of Putin as ""a strong leader"" or his divergence from the party's longstanding commitment to NATO. (A more traditional GOP nominee, Mitt Romney, said during the 2012 presidential debates that Russia was the biggest threat to the U.S. on the planet.) At the same time, for those who say they like Trump because he sticks to his guns, Tillerson is proof — and as such he offers a chance to cheer. And for those who prefer a practitioner of private sector realpolitik over a politician or a polished diplomat, Tillerson may fill the bill rather admirably. For others, even those implacably opposed to Trump and Tillerson both, this may be a moment to consider the options. Sure, the head of ExxonMobil may be the antithesis of everything you hold dear. Yes, you would have preferred the head of Greenpeace USA. But given that Trump was choosing, what did you expect? Tillerson has drawn predictable pushback from all the proper quarters. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders called it ""very troubling ... very sad ... very dangerous,"" because it meant Trump saw ""the short-term profits of the fossil fuel industry [as] more important than climate change and the future of the planet."" Environmental groups such as the Environmental Defense Fund said Trump was putting the oil-and-gas industry interests above Americans' health. Government watchdogs, such as Every Voice, were disturbed, because Tillerson owns so much stock in a company active in 50 countries with interests likely to conflict with those of the U.S. As an example, Tillerson has opposed the U.S.-NATO sanctions on Russia imposed after the latter annexed Crimea — after those sanctions blocked his company's plans to drill below the Arctic Sea with Moscow's blessing. That issue will surely be a feature of his confirmation hearings, if not a major stumbling block. But elections have consequences, as President Obama was once fond of saying. Tillerson makes sense in a Trumpian world, because he breaks the mold of diplomats and politicians who usually command the U.S. State Department. He has no government experience, but that is surely not disqualifying in the Trump administration. Trump and Tillerson are two tough-minded corporate businessmen who have spent decades atop large companies with global interests. Both have a penchant for big projects and a professed devotion to the works of philosopher-novelist Ayn Rand. Trump makes a show of downscale tastes while living in a tower on Fifth Avenue. Tillerson has the versatility to talk Texan while also playing the sophisticated realist who sees the world as something more than us versus them. At ExxonMobil he has led a complex, worldwide organization that at least publicly recognizes the realities of climate change, fossil fuels and alternative energies. That veneer of commitment to future technologies will not placate those who see environmental disaster on the horizon. But if Tillerson defines the extremes of drill-baby-drill for these activists, that is just fine with the man who is soon to redecorate the Oval Office. One might say the whole idea behind the Trump Cabinet is to pick people who personify ""the problem"" — as defined in the liberal mindset. Whether Trump ultimately follows his team of hotspurs or uses them as heat shields as he negotiates a new reality, he sees them all as serving his purpose — not the other way around. Trump nominees Georgia Rep. Tom Price (Health and Human Services) and Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt (the Environmental Protection Agency) are prime examples of this. Each can protect Trump's right flank within the GOP if and when the new president cuts his own deals on health care and the environment. Tillerson is more multidimensional than that, and may prove more original and interesting. Trump clearly wants a redefinition of the Russia relationship, and he may pursue that with a combination of Tillerson on one hand and a hard-line old-fashioned Cold Warrior on the other. For example, former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton has been mentioned as a possible No. 2 at State. That should be a sufficient reminder to administration critics that other candidates for the most prestigious and symbolic Cabinet job — including Bolton and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani — might have made the Tillerson choice seem palatable by comparison.

npr,"December 14, 2016",Tech Leaders To Meet With President-Elect Trump," Gates offered this example: President-elect Trump is not sold on climate change. Gates — the co-chair of a new billion-dollar investment fund for clean energy — is. On CNBC Tuesday morning, Gates made it sound like that disagreement is a minor detail because, he said, ""This administration likes a good deal."" Deal. Key word! Even if Trump doubts the science, Gates believes the president-elect could be convinced to throw federal money at companies pursing green technology — if that would create jobs. On China, despite every threat Trump has made regarding trade, Gates used that word — deal — again: ""Well, I don't think it would be a good deal to have trade relations between China and the U.S. really fall apart."" Gates said Trump was elected for his leadership style — not policy positions — and those positions can change. In his post-meeting remarks Gates threw in a little flattery, making this comment about Trump's Twitter style: ""Yeah, he tweets more than I do. I'm impressed. You know, I come from the tech industry and I just can't keep up."" It's important to contrast Gates' voice — the tech titan pragmatist/optimist — with the voice of Microsoft's current chief. Or rather, his silence. Microsoft would not confirm if CEO Satya Nadella is attending the summit. Other CEOs have been equally cagey. The Trump transition team says they may release a list of attendees after the meeting. Gary Shapiro, head of the trade group Consumer Technology Association, will not be on that list. He's not boycotting. ""Sadly I did not get my invitation,"" he says. ""Sadly,"" because he's ""thrilled"" about the meeting. He thinks Trump will be better than President Obama on business issues. Shapiro offers a long list of possible industry wins under Trump: a holiday on cash repatriation (so tech companies can bring back their stockpiles of overseas money without a big tax bill); a lower corporate tax rate; aggressive moves to push back on Chinese and European protectionism; and even immigration — for so-called high-skilled, Ph.D. types. ""President Obama and the Democrats said they wanted to do that, but they always tied it into overall immigration reform — which as Steve Jobs said on his death bed, that will kill it,"" he says. ""And that's what indeed has happened the last seven years. No action on immigration, and Trump can get action on immigration."" There's another place Trump could get action, which CEOs might not like: bringing tech manufacturing back to the U.S., where it's more expensive. China tells U.S. companies, if they want to sell there, they have to manufacture there. Robert Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, says Trump could pressure the Chinese government to drop that rule, and shame U.S. tech companies for bowing to it. ""You get rid of those policies, you will have more semi-conductor jobs in the U.S., in places like Boise, Idaho, in places like New Mexico and Arizona and Oregon. Trump could do that,"" Atkinson says. The summit is being organized by Peter Thiel, an early Trump backer who's also on the board of Facebook. While CEOs may be meeting with the president-elect, hundreds of their employees have signed a statement, called neveragain.tech, pledging to not build databases that could be used for racial profiling of Muslims and other minorities.

npr,"December 14, 2016","For CIA Nominee Mike Pompeo, 'Not A Good Situation To Inherit'"," Mike Pompeo, a Republican congressman from Kansas and Donald Trump's pick to run the CIA, is no stranger to Russian intrigue. After graduating first in his class from West Point in 1986, he headed to Europe. There, according to his official bio, he served as a cavalry officer, ""patrolling the Iron Curtain before the fall of the Berlin Wall."" The situation Pompeo now faces as Trump's CIA nominee would test the savviest politician: If confirmed, he will go to work for a president who is openly feuding with the agency he's preparing to run. Since his election to Congress six years ago, Pompeo has carved a reputation for taking hard-line positions. On C-SPAN in February, he spoke in harsh terms about former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, saying, ""He should be brought back from Russia and given due process. And I think the proper outcome would be, that he would be given the death sentence."" Then there's Iran and the nuclear deal. The current CIA director, John Brennan, recently told the BBC that tearing up that deal would be ""the height of folly,"" saying: ""I think it would be disastrous, it really would. For one administration to tear up an agreement that a previous administration made would be almost unprecedented."" But the day before his CIA nomination was publicly announced, Pompeo tweeted, ""I look forward to rolling back this disastrous deal."" Then there's Benghazi. During hearings last year investigating the 2012 attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Libya, Pompeo, a Harvard-trained lawyer, grilled Hillary Clinton about what contact information Ambassador Chris Stevens, who died in the attack, had for her. Even after the congressional investigation found no evidence of wrongdoing by Clinton, Pompeo and another Republican wrote their own 48-page addendum to the official report, alleging a cover-up and harshly criticizing Clinton. So how might Pompeo handle the leap from the partisan knife fights of Capitol Hill to the challenge of running an agency that is supposed to operate above the political fray? Jane Harman, who spent 18 years representing California in Congress and served as the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, says Pompeo will have to change roles. ""He's been in the politician role. Now he's going to be in the speak truth to power role,"" says Harman, currently head of the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington. ""He should be asked about his views in confirmation hearings. I'm sure he will be. You know, among other things — the head of the CIA has to go dark."" In other words, he has to stay out of the headlines. But that is not where the CIA currently finds itself. Three Senate committees now say they will investigate Russian cyber-hacks and why the CIA has concluded the motive for them was to elect Trump, Pompeo's soon-to-be boss. ""This is not a good situation for a CIA director to inherit,"" says John McLaughlin, former acting director of the agency. ""On the other hand, welcome to the CIA director's world. A CIA director is almost always dealing with some sort of controversy. This one's bigger than the average one. And it comes on top of all the other things he's going to have to do."" Those challenges include unraveling the war in Syria or destroying ISIS. ""Anyone moving from Capitol Hill to CIA is crossing a sort of Rubicon,"" McLaughlin says, ""because the mission of the agency is to look at events in the world dispassionately. I would say, even clinically. And then to step back, and let the policymakers decide what they wish to do with that."" There are hints that Pompeo may already be beginning that transition, taking steps toward going dark in preparation for his confirmation hearing next month. He's laid low since being nominated, and not emerged for a single interview. But this past weekend, as the controversy over the CIA and Russia erupted into a full-blown political and media frenzy, Pompeo was tweeting — about a Santa's Village. He's still a Kansas congressman, and the actress Kirstie Alley has built a snowy tableau in the front yard of her Wichita house. ""Looks great, @kirstiealley!"" wrote Pompeo. He hasn't tweeted since.

npr,"December 14, 2016","Rep. Zinke Chosen To Head Interior, Published Reports Say"," Donald Trump has chosen first-term Republican Congressman Ryan Zinke of Montana to be his secretary of the interior. That's according to multiple news sources. If confirmed, Zinke would take over one of the most closely watched and controversial posts in the cabinet. He would be in charge of managing some 500 million acres of federal public lands and close to 400 national parks and monuments. NPR's Kirk Siegler joins us now from Laramie, Wyo., where he's been reporting about public lands issues facing the new administration. Good morning, Kirk. KIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel. MARTIN: So Congressman Zinke was among several names that had been floated for this job. Tell us a little more about his background and why the president-elect chose him. SIEGLER: Right, well, for starters, he was an early and vocal supporter of Donald Trump, so I think that's a big factor. Zinke served nearly two decades in the Navy SEALs. He's a decorated veteran. He's certainly a rising star in the Republican Party. He served in the Montana legislature before being elected to Congress in 2014. In both places, you know, he's became quickly known as a champion of conservative causes. He's a very vocal advocate of oil and gas drilling and expanding oil and gas drilling on federal lands as well as coal mining. And, not surprisingly, like a lot of House Republicans, he gets a pretty poor rating from environmental groups for his party-line votes on issues like mining and the climate. MARTIN: So his environmental record is well known, but I understand there's at least one recent instance where he bucked his party line. SIEGLER: Yes, and this is a very closely watched issue, especially here in Wyoming and the rural west, and it's an important one. It's this proposal in Congress to transfer ownership and management of millions of acres of federal lands to the states. This is included as a pillar in the RNC platform. You'll recall that this issue was at the heart of what Cliven Bundy and his militia were demanding in those armed anti-government standoffs out in Oregon and Nevada. But Ryan Zinke, at least for now, has said he's opposed to this transfer. He told Montana Public Radio recently that he's always been a strong supporter of public lands. Let's hear a little tape of that quickly. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RYAN ZINKE: Public land should not be sold or transferred, but certainly we need to look at better ways of managing our public lands in the best interest of all. SIEGLER: And, Rachel, Donald Trump seemed to say as much, too, on the campaign trail, although the issue hasn't come up recently, anyway. MARTIN: So we mentioned you're in a state with a lot of federal land, Wyoming, also a state that is very pro-states' rights in trying to protect the rights of ranchers and farmers. What are you hearing about Zinke? SIEGLER: Well, right, this is an energy state. I think Zinke is going to be seen as pretty popular here. And he's a lifelong hunter and fisherman. This will carry a lot of clout for him across the rural West, not the least of which in his home state of Montana, one state to the north. You know, yesterday, I was out on a story with a hunter who was scoping out an upcoming elk hunt north of Laramie. And, you know, he told me that sportsmen are ready and will likely work with Zinke and vice versa. He was especially hopeful that Zinke would continue to fight for access to public lands and keeping federal public lands public. So we'll have to see how that plays out in Congress and both in the Department of Interior going forward. MARTIN: NPR's Kirk Siegler from Laramie, Wyo. Thanks so much, Kirk.

npr,"December 14, 2016","A Year Later, Unfiltered Flint Tap Water Is Still Unsafe To Drink"," The state says more than 600 pipes have been replaced in Flint, Mich., this year — but 30,000 suspect pipes remain. A year ago, Flint, Mich., Mayor Karen Weaver declared a state of emergency because of lead-contaminated drinking water, attracting national outrage and sympathy, and millions of gallons of donated water. But a year later donations have slowed to a trickle, and little has changed — unfiltered water here is still unsafe to drink. With frigid temperatures and flurries swirling around outside, the crowd inside Flint's downtown transit station ebbs and flows as buses come and go. At the end of one bus terminal, 10 large pallets of bottled water stand about 4 feet tall. Keith Hill fills two bags with about 20 pounds of water bottles before making the long trek home. He hates doing this. ""Yeah, it's pretty much bad, because we can't do nothing about it, and they ain't doing nothing about it,"" Hill says. ""City of Flint going down — that's making it worse."" Many residents say that Flint's decades old economic struggles only have been worsened by this crisis, and that despite all the attention, there has been little progress. Flint Mayor Karen Weaver also is frustrated. ""We're in year three, actually, of not being able to drink water, and that still makes no sense to me,"" Weaver says. ""And it shouldn't make sense to anybody else."" Flint's drinking water issues date back to 2014, when the city's water source was switched to the Flint River. Mistakes in treating the corrosive river water damaged pipes, which continue to leach lead. Despite tests showing lead levels declining, many people don't believe their tap water ever will be safe to drink again. The state has spent more than $200 million in Flint distributing more than 3 million cases of bottled water and 145,000 water filters. State officials are trying to convince residents to use the filters, but many just don't trust them. Replacing the lines Flint is getting some help, though. Last week, Congress finally approved $170 million in aid — though city officials say they'll need tens of millions more to replace all of the city's lead pipes. The state says about 600 pipes have been replaced this year; at that rate it would take half a century to replace more than 30,000 suspect lines. Michael McDaniel oversees the effort. ""It was a matter of the city really lacking, not just the finances, but because they lacked the finances for so long they lacked the capacity,"" McDaniel said.

 Flint's drinking water issues date back to 2014, when the city's water source was switched to the Flint River. While McDaniel expects the pace to speed up, it still will take years and cost more than $100 million to replace all the lines. More than 400 civil lawsuits — some of them class-action cases — will take years to be resolved too, and there are criminal cases as well. Nine government employees have already been charged with tampering with evidence and willful neglect of office. Two have cut deals with a special prosecutor, but more charges could be coming. Water for the holidays At the end of a difficult year, some Flint residents are trying to put the water crisis aside to get in the Christmas spirit. A few days ago a small crowd gathered outside Flint City Hall to celebrate the beginning of the holiday season with a tree lighting ceremony. But even at a Christmas event, the water crisis was not far away. As a choir sang outside City Hall, many in the crowd moved inside, where their kids could sit on Santa's lap and where the adults could do something they've been doing all year long — pick up some bottled water to take home.

npr,"December 13, 2016",Government Ethics Office Says Trump Should Divest Himself Of His Businesses," President-elect Donald Trump should divest himself of his vast business interests in order to avoid conflicts of interest while in the White House, according to a letter from the U.S. Office of Government Ethics. Moreover, transferring ownership of his businesses to his grown children wouldn't go far enough to address the conflicts, the letter said. ""Transferring operational control of a company to one's children would not constitute the establishment of a qualified blind trust, nor would it eliminate conflicts of interest"" under federal statutes governing conflicts of interest, said the letter, written by OGE Director Walter M. Shaub, Jr. The letter was written in response to questions from Democratic Sen. Tom Carper of Delaware, ranking member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, who wrote: ""The full extent of his financial interests remains unclear, in part because he was the first presidential candidate in modern history to decline to release his tax returns to the American public. These unique circumstances raise important questions about how the Administration of President-elect Trump will avoid conflicts of interest and ensure integrity of executive branch programs and operation."" With his vast network of licensing deals, golf courses and commercial real estate, Trump and his family stand to profit from his presidency to an unprecedented degree. Virtually any decision Trump makes could affect part of his domestic or international business empire. A federal statute bars executive branch employees, including cabinet officials, from participating in any decision that would affect their financial interests or those of their family and business partners. Shaub noted that the statute does not apply to the president and vice president, as Trump himself has pointed out. ""Nevertheless, it has been the consistent policy of the executive branch that a President should conduct himself 'as if' he were bound by this financial conflict of interest law,"" Shaub wrote. He added: ""Given the unique circumstances of the Presidency, OGE's view is that a President should comply with this law by divesting conflicting assets, establishing a qualified blind trust, or both."" Shaub noted that his office has no power to force Trump to divest, but said ""every President in modern times has adopted OGE's recommendedapproach."" Trump was supposed to hold a press conference this Thursday promising to explain how he would address the conflicts, but cancelled it this week. Instead he said an announcement would come on the subject in January. During the campaign, Trump said he would turn over business operations to three of his grown children and promised to have nothing to do with his companies. He repeated that promise this weekend. But lawyers who specialize in government ethics say that wouldn't begin to resolve the conflicts Trump's presidency poses. The OGE has already made its voice heard on the issue of Trump's businesses. It released an unusual series of tweets earlier this month encouraging Trump to divest.

npr,"December 13, 2016",Reports: Trump Nominates Rep. Ryan Zinke To Head Interior Department," And there is word tonight of yet another Cabinet decision. President-elect Donald Trump has tapped a freshman Republican congressman from Montana to be his Interior secretary according to several news organizations. Ryan Zinke is a former Navy SEAL commander and an avid outdoorsman. NPR's Kirk Siegler reports that Representative Zinke has won praise for his support of access to public lands in the West. KIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE: If confirmed as Interior secretary, Congressman Ryan Zinke of Montana would be in charge of managing more than 500 million acres of public lands mostly in the West, including close to 400 national parks and monuments, not to mention countless dams and reservoirs. This is a high-stakes job. Federal lands generate millions of dollars for the recreation and tourism industries as well as mining and cattle grazing. This is land that's open to all of us. It's just that what we can and cannot do on it is a decision that usually rests with the Interior secretary. Mark Trahant is a professor at the University of North Dakota. MARK TRAHANT: I'm always reminded of that old joke that it doesn't matter who's elected president of the United States. It matters in the West when the secretary of Interior is appointed because that's the person that has the most direct say over our lives. SIEGLER: A lifelong hunter and fisherman, Congressman Zinke's selection as the possible next head of Interior is drawing some initial praise from sportsmen here in the West who say he's had success balancing the public's right to access federal public lands with oil and gas drilling and coal mining.

npr,"December 13, 2016",Trump Taps Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke To Lead Interior Department," Rep. Ryan Zinke, R-Mont., spoke at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July. Updated Dec. 15, 11:30 a.m. ET President-elect Donald Trump has selected Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke to be his interior secretary, the transition team announced Thursday morning. Zinke is a first-term congressman and a former Navy SEAL commander who served in Iraq and was awarded two Bronze Stars. He was re-elected to a second term last month with 56 percent of the vote. In the House, the Republican lawmaker serves on the Natural Resources Committee and has split with his party before to defend public access to federal lands. Zinke resigned his position this summer as a delegate to the Republican National Convention after the GOP platform supported transferring federal public lands to the states. ""What I saw was a platform that was more divisive than uniting,"" Zinke told the Billings Gazette in July. ""At this point, I think it's better to show leadership."" Zinke still spoke at the convention in Cleveland in support of Trump, whom he endorsed last May. However, Zinke is overall not praised by environmentalists. He has just a 3 percent voting record with the League of Conservation Voters and is a supporter of coal, oil and gas exploration. He also backs building the Keystone XL pipeline. The interior secretary is one of the most closely monitored — and controversial — Cabinet positions, especially in the American West. The department oversees the management of more than 500 million acres of federal public lands, including close to 400 national parks and federal monuments, not to mention numerous dams and reservoirs. ""I'm always reminded of that old joke that it doesn't matter who's elected president of the United States; it matters in the West when the secretary of interior is appointed,"" said Mark Trahant, a professor at the University of North Dakota. ""That's the person who has the most direct say over our lives."" Trahant, who is also a member of the Shoshone Bannock tribe in Idaho, predicted one of the top priorities of the next secretary under Trump will be to develop more oil and gas reserves, especially on tribal lands. Another equally controversial item on the department's agenda could be the federal government's overall role in management of all federal lands in the West. During the Obama administration, fringe Western lands groups on the far right — including rancher Cliven Bundy and his sons, who staged armed standoffs over cattle grazing in Nevada and Oregon — pushed for massive amounts of federal land to be turned over to the states and local counties. Zinke told Montana Public Radio recently that he is open to reforms in how the federal government manages lands, but he reiterated: ""I have always been a strong supporter of public lands, and have voted against the transfer or sale of public lands. My position is known and well-established."" Zinke has a bachelor's degree in geology from the University of Oregon, where he played on the football team. If Zinke is confirmed by the Senate, it could be a setback for Republican hopes to knock off Democratic Sen. Jon Tester in 2018. Tester is a top GOP target and Zinke was considered to be a strong challenger to the Democratic incumbent. Zinke confirmed a few weeks ago that he was considering a bid. In theory, Zinke could still serve but resign early to campaign back in Montana, and even use the position to boost his credentials against Tester. Still, for what's seen as one of the top opportunities for Republicans in two years, the lack of time to build a campaign and raise funds would be a setback. Trump had also considered House Republican Conference Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., to lead the Interior Department, and many believed she was the likely pick, but a source close to the congresswoman said Tuesday those reports were driven by the transition team and that she did not receive an offer or a call from the president-elect. In a Facebook post, McMorris Rodgers said it was an honor to meet with Trump last week, but that she was looking forward to continuing in Congress, where she is the highest-ranking woman in GOP leadership.

npr,"December 13, 2016",Trump's Cabinet Picks 'Take The Establishment And Shake It Upside Down'," With the selection of Rex Tillerson for secretary of state and the expected nomination of Rick Perry for the Department of Energy, Donald Trump's Cabinet has largely taken shape in Trump's own image — a combination of millionaires, billionaires, outsiders and even a few politicians who oppose the work of the very agencies they've been tapped to lead. ""It's a reflection of what Donald Trump has been wanting to do, which is to take the establishment and shake it upside down,"" said Ron Bonjean, a Republican consultant. Bonjean pointed out that Trump is coming into office not like a traditional Republican president but with an approach all his own. ""It's as if these Cabinet secretaries are each moving into a house and completely demolishing it and turning it upside down and remodeling it the way they want to see it,"" he said. And that's exactly what Trump voters were asking for — to take a wrecking ball to Washington and start over. Energy ""oops"" Looking at domestic policy, you could describe many of Trump's choices as an Anti-Cabinet. Take former Texas Gov. Rick Perry who, during a 2011 presidential debate, famously attempted to list three government agencies he'd do away with. He stuttered and paused and just couldn't think of the third, finally saying, ""Oops."" That third agency Perry wanted to eliminate, the one he couldn't remember? It was the Department of Energy, the very department he'll head up, pending Senate confirmation. A climate skeptic at EPA Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, whom Trump has picked to head the Environmental Protection Agency, is a climate change skeptic, a promoter of the fossil-fuels industry and has described himself as ""a leading advocate against the EPA's activist agenda."" He has sued the agency repeatedly. ""What the Affordable Care Act was to health care, what Dodd-Frank was to the banking and finance system, the Clean Power Plan is to our power grid and energy in this country,"" Pruitt said at the Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, in March 2016. Pruitt argues that Congress needs to be more prescriptive when it comes to environmental goals and that the EPA shouldn't be in the business of writing regulations. An Obamacare critic at HHS Trump's choice to head the Department of Health and Human Services, Rep. Tom Price, is an opponent of the Affordable Care Act. When it comes to Medicare, he favors creating a voucher system. ""The problem isn't that there isn't enough government involvement in health care,"" Price said in an interview on Fox Business. ""The problem is that there's too much."" Undermining public education from the Education Department? Trump's choice for the Department of Education, Betsy DeVos, is a staunch advocate for charter schools and school vouchers. Teachers unions say that would undermine public schools. A dim view of government social programs at HUD And then there's Ben Carson, Trump's pick for the Department of Housing and Urban Development. He's a renowned neurosurgeon with no experience in housing policy who has expressed a dim view of government social programs, many of which are administered through HUD. ""My stance is that we the people have the responsibility to take care of the indigent in our society,"" said Carson during a CNN town hall. ""It's not the government's job."" Carson has described the war on poverty as an expensive failure. A potential labor secretary whose company has been cited for overtime violations by ... the Labor Department Andy Puzder, who runs the company that owns the Carl's Jr. and Hardee's fast-food chains, is on tap to lead the Labor Department, the very agency that cited Hardee's for overtime violations. Puzder also opposes significant increases in the minimum wage and has advocated for automation to replace low-wage workers. ""Out of the ordinary"" ""I have to say it's really quite shocking,"" said Neera Tanden, president of the left-leaning Center for American Progress. She served on the Obama transition team in 2008. It's not uncommon for there to be significant policy shifts when control of the White House changes parties. But Tanden said this goes well beyond that. ""You did not see that with previous Republican administrations,"" said Tanden. ""Obviously there were some Cabinet members who were very, very conservative. But it's unusual to have picks who do not believe in the department itself and the mission of the department."" And there's another way Trump is breaking with tradition: government experience. ""So many of these people are so very inexperienced in terms of the Cabinet departments that they've been tapped to oversee,"" said Dave Cohen, a political science professor from the University of Akron, who studies the presidency and White House staffing. There are wildly wealthy business executives like Wilbur Ross for commerce secretary, Steven Mnuchin for Treasury secretary, Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson for secretary of state and Linda McMahon as administrator of the Small Business Administration. They are all people with impressive resumes in business, but like many of Trump's choices, no experience in government or the agencies they hope to lead. Cohen said Republicans and Democrats alike have typically chosen Cabinet secretaries from people who have served in the agencies they will lead or have other relevant government experience. ""I think it is very out of the ordinary,"" Cohen said. ""You know what a president usually tries to do is to place people in the Cabinet that won't run into a lot of objection on Capitol Hill, and one way you do that is you appoint people that have a vast amount of experience.""

npr,"December 13, 2016","Department Of Energy Defies Trump, Won't Name Climate Change Workers"," The Department of Energy is refusing the Trump transition team's request to name those who have worked on climate change within the department, because of concerns about what the incoming administration will do with the names. President-elect Donald Trump has denied climate change is real. NPR's Jennifer Ludden tells our Newscast unit the request of such names was included in a 74-question document distributed to the agency's workforce. Jennifer says, ""The Trump team wants the names of career employees and contractors who have attended U.N. climate talks over the past five years. It also wants emails about those meetings."" The full list of questions can be found here. On Tuesday, the department released a statement saying the questionnaire had ""unsettled"" many in its workforce, that it would ""be forthcoming with all [publicly] available information"" but it would withhold ""any individual names."" ""We are going to respect the professional and scientific integrity and independence of our employees at our labs and across our department,"" said spokesman Eben Burnham-Snyder. The questionnaire had been seen among employees and critics as a precursor to a purge of climate scientists from the next administration. Jennifer told Weekend Edition last Saturday: ""They're unnerved. They're concerned. They say this kind of letter is not really normal. ... [Sen. Ed Markey] sent a letter to Trump warning that if people are penalized for simply doing their jobs that it's going to amount to an 'illegal political witch hunt' — that's a quote. The Union of Concerned Scientists ... also issued a statement saying this seems designed to intimidate workers. And they said it, quote, 'smacks of McCarthyism.' "" As pointed out in that interview, Trump has signaled plans to break from the Obama administration's policies to reduce carbon emissions. Jennifer says: ""He said he wants to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate deal. He's talked about ... job-killing regulations he wants to end. And then ... we got more insight this week. He named his head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt. [Pruitt] has expressed skepticism about climate change, and he helped spearhead this lawsuit by 28 states to try to overturn President Obama's Clean Power Plan.

npr,"December 13, 2016","For Trump's Top Diplomat, Questions Loom About Conflicts Of Interest"," Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson, President-elect Trump's nominee for secretary of state, will have his Senate confirmation hearing in January. Before then, experts say, he'll have to think hard about how to divest from a company where he has spent his entire career. Tillerson reportedly owns 2.6 million shares of Exxon Mobil stock, which would be worth about $240 million, as of the Wall Street close on Tuesday. When John Kerry became secretary of state nearly four years ago, he and his wife, Teresa Heinz, divested from a long list of companies to avoid any possibility of a conflict of interest. For the same reason, George Shultz — an executive at Bechtel before serving as Ronald Reagan's top diplomat — set up a blind trust, says Davis Robinson, the State Department's legal adviser at the time. But, Robinson says, ""his was not as complicated as Mr. Tillerson, because Mr. Tillerson owns so much of Exxon Mobil stock."" Blind trusts and divestment are two of the most common options to meet the requirements of federal ethics laws. And tax breaks allow wealthy appointees to defer capital-gains taxes when they sell off assets so they can serve in government. Paul Light, the Paulette Goddard Professor of Public Service at New York University, says divestment is the most effective cure to conflict of interest concerns. ""If you are to reassure the public that your negotiations with foreign governments have no tie to your financial interests, you divest,"" he says. For Tillerson, that may not be enough. Even if he divests from Exxon Mobil stock, he will face tough questions on Capitol Hill about his past dealings, especially in Russia. Tillerson opposed U.S. sanctions on Russia, imposed after Russia annexed Crimea, that slowed a joint project between Exxon Mobil and Russian energy giant Rosneft to drill in the Arctic. ""It troubles me greatly that Mr. Tillerson would have reason to advocate for the rolling back of sanctions because that would be the best interests of his company,"" says Sen. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat who serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ""And it is my hope that he's enough of a patriot to separate his decades-long affiliation with this major oil company and the genuine interest of the American people."" Russia isn't the only place of concern, Coons says. ""I suspect we will be having discussions about a number of different countries where he negotiated relationships or deals with dictators or authoritarian regimes that worked for Exxon Mobil, but will not work for America's interests,"" he says. Edward Verona, a former Exxon Mobil colleague of Tillerson's in Russia, now with McLarty Associates in Washington, D.C., believes the oil executive will be able to make the switch to the State Department. ""I don't believe that he would, certainly not consciously, do anything that would contravene the interests of the United States for the potential benefit of his former company. That's just my sense of him,"" he says. Republican Sen. Bob Corker, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman, says he will chair a confirmation hearing for Tillerson in early January. But before the nominee meets with any senators, he'll need to answer the committee's questionnaire about whether and how he will sever his business relationships with Exxon Mobil.

npr,"December 13, 2016",First Mention: Rick Perry Runs For Texas Agriculture Commissioner," UNIDENTIFIED MAN: First mention. SIEGEL: The earliest reference to Rick Perry that we could find on NPR was on October 27, 1990. And he was talking mushrooms. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RICK PERRY: Folks, we can grow reishi mushrooms in our backyards and Chinese cabbage and blueberries until the world looks level. And we ain't going to make a real impact on the Texas economy. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  Perry was talking mushrooms back then because he was running for state agricultural commissioner. He was challenging the incumbent Democrat, Jim Hightower. SIEGEL: Perry argued that the office needed to get back to the basics of Texas agriculture, like cattle, corn and cotton. CORNISH: He said Hightower was too focused on less traditional crops like wine grapes, cut flowers and those mushrooms. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PERRY: Now, we may have a heck of a time out there on the sides of the roads selling those babies and meeting lots of interesting people. But we are not going to make a dent - we're not going to make a blip on that economic graph in the state of Texas. CORNISH: Jim Hightower was way ahead in the polls at the time. So almost everyone was caught by surprise when Rick Perry narrowly won that election in 1990. SIEGEL: It was Perry's first win at statewide office and well before he went on to become Texas governor and maybe the next secretary of energy. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"December 13, 2016",Multiple Investigations Underway On Russian Ties To U.S. Election," We're going to take a moment now to check in on the latest twists involving Russia, the CIA and Donald Trump. Specifically, what we know and what we don't know about the CIA assessment that Russia intervened in the November election to tip it to Trump. NPR's Mary Louise Kelly has been working her sources, and she's with us now. Welcome. MARY LOUISE KELLY, BYLINE: Thank you, Robert. SIEGEL: Let's start with the various investigations underway. The White House has ordered a review of what's known. Senators on Capitol Hill said that they'll do the same. Where do things stand there? KELLY: Well, they certainly are gearing up. There are three Senate committees so far. The Intelligence Committee is leading the way, but Armed Services also says they're going to investigate. And just today, we heard the Foreign Relations Committee also plans to join the bandwagon. Now, we don't know what form that will take. Are we talking hearings? Or - will they be public hearings, closed hearings? Will we see a report - all to be determined. SIEGEL: What exactly is Congress trying to learn? What are the biggest outstanding questions at this point? KELLY: Well, at this point, go back to the issue that has been making news this week of - that there are maybe differing opinions between the CIA and the FBI, if that is in fact true. If they have reached different views on Russian motives, why? What's informing that? Also, key question - was the RNC, the Republican National Committee - were they hacked? U.S. intelligence agencies say yes, they were. The RNC says no, we weren't. I mean, that would seem, Robert, to be a question that a cybersecurity expert could answer. And that basic technical question could be put out there and you put that to rest. But this is still a question. Other key questions - what's the timeline? What do we know about when this all started? Is it ongoing? Does it continue at this moment? And the biggie, which is attribution - that's always a challenge in cyber cases. The DNI, the director of National Intelligence, has said with confidence that only Russia's most senior officials could have authorized these hacks. Donald Trump, as we keep hearing, says that is ridiculous. He doesn't believe it. He says the DNI has no idea if this was Russia. SIEGEL: And with confidence is a term of art here. It's a... KELLY: It is a term of art. It's a very different thing to say we believe this or we have confidence in this, we have high, confidence, medium confidence. These are things that the intelligence community agonizes over, the precise wording to give a sense of how sure they are. SIEGEL: As you mentioned, we don't know if the hearings are going to be public or not. How likely is it that more evidence will be made public? Can the CIA actually share more of what it knows without revealing, as they say, sources and methods of gathering intelligence? KELLY: Right, the classic question, sources and methods. And the CIA, as we know, is an agency that by definition operates in the shadows. Making things public does not come easily to them. As someone who tries to crack them every day, I can you that firsthand. I will say based on calls that I was making today, I heard - let's call it a growing view - that the agency has a responsibility to be more specific about how they have reached certainty in this case. I mean, protecting sources is something that the CIA takes very seriously for obvious reasons. There are lives at stake. But here's one scenario, how this could unfold, that a former senior CIA official outlined for me today. This is an official who has testified before Congress, who has faced questions about this type - thing before. And he - and this official said, look, start with the fact there's never 100 percent certainty in the intelligence world. Sources lie to you. Intercepted messages can be misunderstood. Even if you happen to hear a conversation, overheard conversations can be misinterpreted. But in a case like this, the official said you could imagine saying the information I'm sharing with you came from a human source who is one of the most reliable sources I've seen in my career as CIA station chief. Boom. That would not reveal any sources. And it would have the added bonus in the Russia case, this official said, of driving Russia's spy services crazy trying to figure out who it was. SIEGEL: (Laughter) Donald Trump gets sworn in next month. It's a big deal for a president to openly question his intelligence officers. How... KELLY: It is. SIEGEL: How is all that playing at the CIA? KELLY: There is anxiety at the CIA, as you would imagine. I don't think alarm is too strong a word - also soul-searching. A couple of former senior CIA officers I reached today said, look, if there is a trust deficit between the CIA and the incoming president, which it appears there is, it's the CIA's job to fix that. He is the customer-in-chief. The stakes are too high not to work with him. SIEGEL: That's NPR national security correspondent Mary Louise Kelly. Thanks. KELLY: You're welcome. Copyright © 2016 NPR.

npr,"December 13, 2016",Red State Democrat Prepared To Work With Donald Trump On Trade," JOE DONNELLY: Thank you so much for having me with you today. CORNISH: Now, to start, we want to note that you had high praise for Donald Trump for doing the Carrier factory deal. That's the deal that preserved a little less than half of the factory jobs that this company planned to send to Mexico. But Democrats really hammered Trump about this deal. So are you at odds with the left wing of your party already? DONNELLY: Well, no. I think that the key to this is that we did have approximately 700 more folks be able to stay in their jobs. And that was a critical element of it. And what I've said is that I hope President-elect Trump will work with me and with the rest of the Senate to try to keep more jobs here in America. I mean, I want to make sure that everybody, when they get to the Christmas table, has a chance to tell their family, hey, I've been able to stay in my job. That's what the focus is. That's what we're trying to get Donald Trump to join in on. CORNISH: Now, Republicans, particularly Republicans in the Senate, decided early on to essentially stand fast against President Obama. And that worked pretty well for them. Should Democrats become the party of no during a Trump administration? DONNELLY: Well that seems pretty un-American to me - what they did. My job isn't to represent the Democrat Party or the Republican Party. It's to represent Hoosier families. I thought that was shameful behavior. And my job is to do what's right. And that's what I'm going to try and do. CORNISH: You talked about Hoosier families. But Trump won your state by nearly 20 percent. So does it sound like they agree with his agenda? And what does that leave for you, as a Democrat in the Senate? DONNELLY: Well, I think that the people in our state want to see more jobs, more opportunity. And they want to make sure that Washington listens to them. Look, I have an agricultural community that's second to none in the world. And every time they tried to move forward, it seemed the EPA was working against them in - turn after turn. And so they've always said, we want clean water. But we want to be part of the solution. And so I think that was a message that the folks not only in my state but around the country - want people to listen to them and know that they're here, know that they have a lot to contribute and make our country stronger. CORNISH: You mentioned concerns about the EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency. When you look at these cabinet choices by the incoming administration, which one are you worried about? Because there are Democrats who look at them and say, you've got picks who want to abolish the departments they may be leading, who want to roll back major Democrat-penned legislation like Obamacare. Which one do you think Democrats should challenge? DONNELLY: I'm very concerned about the Tom Price nomination because he talks about privatizing Medicare. CORNISH: This is for the Health and Human Services. DONNELLY: Health and Human Services, yes. He talks about privatizing Medicare. You know, our seniors shouldn't have to check their stock balance before they can get knee surgery. And we're going to stand up for our seniors on this issue. I'm also very concerned about the nominee named today, Rex Tillerson, for secretary of state. I'm very, very concerned about the Russian connections that we're seeing, the potential damage to our national security and the lack of experience. And so I'm concerned about both of those. I think that General Mattis is a good choice in Defense, though. CORNISH: You know, when you were first elected back when you're elected in the House, it was with Blue Dogs, right? There was, like, a whole coalition of red-state Democrats. That's been decimated. DONNELLY: I'm a proud Blue Dog, absolutely. CORNISH: Now you're here in the Senate with, again, just a handful of other Blue Dogs. This is not a group of Democrats that's growing. Can Democrats regain the ground that they've lost with voters in states like yours? DONNELLY: When we talk to them about issues of importance to them, when we talk to them about their family and making sure that we can have better skills training for their kids to get good jobs - that we can try to keep jobs here in America rather than seeing them go overseas - that we'll fight for our friends and neighbors. We'll fight for the people of Muncie and Richmond and Evansville. When they hear... CORNISH: But you don't think Democrats have been doing that up until this point? DONNELLY: Well, not when we've had trade deals that have ship jobs overseas, absolutely not. What we need to do is stand up and fight for our people in our states. CORNISH: Senator Joe Donnelly is a Democrat from Indiana. Thank you for speaking with us. DONNELLY: Thank you so much. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"December 13, 2016",Columbia Journalism Report Criticizes Exxon CEO's Position On Climate Change," The agreement is the one Donald Trump now says he is studying to see whether the U.S. should withdraw from it. Trump has called climate change a hoax. What is Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson's record of statements and actions on climate change? We're going to ask Susanne Rust, who directs the Energy and Environment Reporting Project at Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism. Welcome to the program. SUSANNE RUST: Thank you for having me. SIEGEL: I want to first play something that Rex Tillerson said in 2012 when he appeared before the Council on Foreign Relations. He said this about burning fossil fuels. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) REX TILLERSON: Clearly, there's going to be an impact, so I'm not disputing that increasing CO2 emissions in the atmosphere is going to have an impact. It'll have a warming impact. How large it is is what - is very hard for anyone to predict. SIEGEL: Well, is it fair to say that Rex Tillerson is not a climate change denier? RUST: He is not a climate change denier. Publicly, he has called climate change a real and serious problem. SIEGEL: What about his actions as head of Exxon Mobil? Did he act on those beliefs? RUST: When he stepped up as CEO in the late 2000s, the company did change its public policy, or at least its public communication, on climate change. They accepted that climate change was real, called it something that was concerning and risky not just to the planet, but to the company. However, they are still in the business of supporting the oil and gas business around the world, and actively explore for new oil and gas reserves everywhere. SIEGEL: As CEO, Tillerson was under pressure from, among others, the Rockefeller Family Fund to do more to combat climate change. We should note that Exxon was previously called SO, which stood for SO, Standard Oil, the source of the Rockefeller fortune. What does the Rockefeller family want Exxon Mobil to do? RUST: The Rockefeller family, as well as several other shareholders of Exxon Mobil stock, are concerned that domestic and international policies that would curb greenhouse gas emissions will have an effect on Exxon Mobil's core business. And they are looking for Exxon Mobil to discuss what those reductions might look like in terms of its bottom line. I think they're concerned about things called stranded assets, which would be oil and gas reserves that Exxon Mobil has invested in but will not be able to tap into if these policies are enacted. SIEGEL: So the question is are they really valuable assets or not? How does Exxon Mobil compare to Shell and BP when it comes to environmental practices? RUST: Shell and BP have been much more directed into looking into new forms of energy. They have put more money and resources into green energy. Exxon Mobil has not put as much in. It really is counting on the fact that over the next 30 to 40 years, oil, gas and coal will be fueling the global population. SIEGEL: Mr. Tillerson, when he has spoken about global warming, has said, while there is indeed global warming, it can be coped with through various engineering and other measures, and that the computer models that people use to try to describe how much the Earth will warm by are not competent. And he claims there is great consensus about the weakness of the models. Is he correct in saying that? RUST: Technically, he is correct in saying that nobody knows what is going to happen - where there will be droughts, where there will be hurricanes, where there will be floods. However, it would not be true to say that the models don't predict that climate change is going to have a serious impact on this planet. I think where the models are imprecise is exactly when and where. SIEGEL: Susanne Rust, thanks for talking with us. RUST: Thank you for having me. SIEGEL: Susanne Rust, director of Columbia University's Energy and Environment Reporting Project. POST-BROADCAST CLARIFICATION: During this interview, Susanne Rust is asked about the Rockefeller family's views of Exxon Mobil's efforts to combat climate change. It should have been noted that the Energy and Environment Reporting Project at Columbia University, which Rust directs, receives financial support from the Rockefeller Family Fund and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund.

npr,"December 13, 2016",Trump Postpones Announcement On Plan For Businesses," President-elect Donald Trump says he'll walk away from his sprawling business before he takes office next month, but details of that separation will have to wait. Trump postponed a news conference planned for this week where he was supposed to spell out his plans to distance himself from the Trump Organization. Ethics watchdogs have urged Trump to sell his stakes in his multibillion-dollar business. The president-elect is resisting that. NPR's Scott Horsley joins us now. And Scott, of course people were waiting for this news conference, which was set for Thursday. It's now been put off. But there were a couple of late-night tweets. What can you tell us about that? SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Yeah, the Trump team had said yesterday that they were going to postpone that news conference until sometime next month. And then late last night, Trump tweeted out, quote, ""I will be leaving my business before January 20 so I can focus full-time on the presidency."" He added that his sons, Don Jr. and Eric, would manage the business in his absence and that no new deals would be done during the time he's in the Oval Office. Trump had telegraphed something similar over the weekend when he spoke to Chris Wallace on ""Fox News Sunday."" (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""FOX NEWS SUNDAY WITH CHRIS WALLACE"") DONALD TRUMP: I turned down seven deals with one big player, great player, last week because I thought it could be perceived as a conflict of interest. It was... CHRIS WALLACE: But your kids are going to be able to do it? TRUMP: ...Probably a billion dollars of deals that I turned down because... WALLACE: But if your kids do it, isn't it going to be the same thing? TRUMP: No, it's totally different. They're not president. I mean, they're not president. But they're not going to do it, either. CORNISH: Scott, help us understand what we're hearing. He's talking about having his sons run the business while he runs the country. HORSLEY: That's right. And that's a subtle change from what Donald Trump has said in the past. He used to talk about having his three eldest children run the business. But now it sounds as if his daughter, Ivanka Trump, is also planning to put some distance between herself and the Trump Organization. Now, Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, have both been close advisers to the president-elect. Kushner tagged along when Trump visited the White House last month, and Ivanka Trump sat in on her dad's meeting with the Japanese prime minister, as well as a meeting last week with former Vice President Al Gore. Kushner and Ivanka Trump reportedly have been house hunting here in Washington, and there is speculation that one or both of them could play some ongoing role in a Trump White House. CORNISH: If Trump and his daughter were to simply walk away from the Trump Organization, would that satisfy ethics watchdogs? HORSLEY: I put that question to Noah Bookbinder. He's the executive director of a group, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. He says that doesn't go far enough. NOAH BOOKBINDER: Not even close. The problem is that Donald Trump knows what his business interests are. Most of them have his name on them. He knows where his hotels are, what properties he controls, what kinds of deals they're involved in. Him stepping away won't reduce his knowledge of all of that and of what things would benefit those companies. HORSLEY: Keep in mind Trump has billions of dollars' worth of assets scattered across hundreds of companies in 20 different countries. And as long as those business ties are there, watchdogs say, there will be questions about whether a decision that Donald Trump makes as president is in the country's best interest or the best interest of his personal businesses. The only way they - to avoid that, ethics watchdogs say, is for Trump to sell his business and to put the proceeds into something like a blind trust. There were more than 20 Democratic senators who sent a letter to Trump today urging him to do just that, but he's shown no inclination to move in that direction. And, as the president-elect likes to point out, there's no law that requires him to do so. CORNISH: That's NPR's Scott Horsley. Scott, thank you. HORSLEY: My pleasure, Audie. Copyright © 2016 NPR.

npr,"December 13, 2016",Trump Nominates Rick Perry To Lead Department Of Energy," Multiple media outlets are reporting that Donald Trump plans to nominate Rick Perry to run the Department of Energy. Perry is the former governor of Texas. And at one point in 2011, he was actually the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination. Then, at a primary debate, he promised to abolish three cabinet-level departments and tried to list them off. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RICK PERRY: And I will tell you. It's three agencies of government when I get there that are gone - Commerce, Education and the - what's the third one there? Let's see. (LAUGHTER) CORNISH: That third agency Governor Perry wanted to abolish was the Energy Department, the same one he may soon lead. To talk about Perry's record in Texas is NPR's Wade Goodwyn. He joins us from Dallas. And Wade, although we didn't know it at the time, Perry's memory lapse was kind of his last moment as a national political figure until now, right? WADE GOODWYN, BYLINE: It was definitely a painful moment in presidential debate history. And even though it was a kind of a there-but-for-the-grace-of-God-go-I sort of thing, that was it for Rick Perry. He tried running again for president last year but was never a serious contender - first one to drop out. But now, through the grace of Trump, Rick Perry's back. CORNISH: And he did serve 14 years as Texas governor, the longest-serving governor in the state's history. What was his track record on energy issues during that time? GOODWYN: Well, you're not going to be surprised to hear that he was a big proponent of the fossil-fuel industry. As governor, Perry fought the EPA for years in federal court as the agency tried to regulate the state's prodigious greenhouse-gas emissions. He's a fracking supporter. He attempted to fast-track the expansion of coal-fired power plants in Texas. The governor also has described climate-change science as hysteria and a contrived, phony mess. He sits on the board of directors of Energy Transfer Partners, the company behind the Dakota Access Pipeline. However, I would not describe Perry as hostile, at least historically, to alternative energy. He allowed legislation to pass in Texas which helped make the state the leader in wind energy. But his true loves are the oil, chemical and natural-gas industries. And the feeling was definitely mutual. CORNISH: Now, as we mentioned, when he ran for president the first time, he vowed to abolish the department he's now set to run, the Energy Department. And at the same time, this is a department that seems to be on the defensive. Just today, the agency spokesperson said that they would not turn over names of climate scientist specialists, which was something that the Trump transition team reportedly demanded. GOODWYN: Yeah. I imagine there's some resume sprucing going on as we speak. But the DOE is not just about energy. It manages the nation's nuclear stockpile, science and technology labs around the country. Here's one of Rick Perry's top advisers, Abby McCloskey. ABBY MCCLOSKEY: I would bet that the agency probably stays in existence. However, there are clearly significant areas of reform. And I think that those things will be taken very seriously by the governor and by President-elect Trump. And that's a good thing. GOODWYN: McCloskey's point's well-taken here - and that it's not going to be Rick Perry who sets the Energy Department's agenda. He's going to take his direction from President Trump. CORNISH: Before I let you go, one bit of truly random trivia - Rick Perry was also the first cabinet member who's been a contestant on ""Dancing With The Stars."" What can you tell us about that? GOODWYN: Well, you know, I don't think he threatened Gene Kelly's legacy. But, you know, he wasn't fabulous. But he worked hard, and he got better. CORNISH: That's NPR's Wade Goodwyn in Dallas. Thanks so much. GOODWYN: It's my pleasure. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

npr,"December 13, 2016",Rep. Jeb Hensarling Outlines Future Of Financial Reforms Under Dodd-Frank," Earlier today, we spoke about his plan to do that. And in that conversation, he made the argument that Dodd-Frank was affecting economic growth. JEB HENSARLING: After Dodd-Frank, the big banks were bigger. The small banks are fewer. We're losing a community financial institution a day in America. CORNISH: Do you - by that, do you mean community banks? HENSARLING: Community banks and credit unions - we're losing one a day. CORNISH: But when the FDIC sort of studied that, didn't they find that, say, banks are often acquired by other community banks, right? HENSARLING: Well, they're usually acquired by larger banks because they cannot handle the weight, the load, the complexity and the expense of the Dodd-Frank regulatory onslaught in our community financial institutions, had little or nothing to do with the financial crisis. What we're trying to do, again, is to foster economic growth and to minimize financial panics. And the way we do that is to ensure that banks keep more loss-absorbing capital. CORNISH: And I think it's worth noting that in your version of this legislation, you would actually have banks hold on to more loss-absorbing capital than even is required right now. And if they did that, they'd be able to get out of some Dodd-Frank regulations, right? HENSARLING: Well, indeed it's kind of a Dodd-Frank off-ramp that's financed with private capital. And that is, if you will raise large amounts that are commensurate with a safe and secure banking system, then you can get out of the micromanagement of the federal government. That management, remember, helped bring us into the crisis in the first place. Fannie and Freddie, our federal regulators, said that you didn't have to reserve hardly any capital against mortgage-backed securities or sovereign debt. Think Fannie, Freddie and Greek bonds. So the regulators got it wrong. We would be better served by higher levels of capital than the supposed wisdom of the financial regulators who got it wrong last time. So that's basically the trade-off there. CORNISH: Now that financial service companies, banks and other institutions have been working this many years to put Dodd-Frank in place, how hard will it be to undo it? HENSARLING: Well, I am not ignorant of the Senate's cloture rules. The Senate is not a majoritarian institution, so there are clearly hurdles. It's inside baseball. As you know, there's a process called reconciliation that takes 51 votes. Some aspects of what we're trying to do can be done through that process. Other aspects won't be. CORNISH: So just to clarify, you're willing to use the budget reconciliation - right? - the budget rules that allowed for the pushing through of Obamacare. You're willing to use those here to undo Dodd-Frank. HENSARLING: Well, it can't - there are only certain aspects of Dodd-Frank that are reconcilable under our budget rules. And frankly it's a fairly small universe of issues that are. So I have an open mind. It's not an empty mind. I always - I'm always ready to negotiate in good faith with others. But I'm hopeful that after six years, people can tell that the promises of Dodd-Frank unfortunately weren't realized no matter what good intentions there may have been. I would hope that many Democrats - reasonable Democrats - would want to sit down and say, OK, this maybe wasn't chiseled in stone. Maybe Dodd-Frank did not come down from Mount Sinai on tablets. And so we have passed a bill out of the Financial Services Committee, and I hope early in the next Congress we'll get it passed out of the full House. And I look forward to seeing what the Senate can produce, again, to get jobs growing in America and to give every American the ability to achieve financial independence which I don't think they can do under Dodd-Frank. CORNISH: Well, Jeb Hensarling, thank you so much for explaining it to us. HENSARLING: Well, you're welcome, and thanks for the invitation to come on the show. CORNISH: Texas Congressman Jeb Hensarling is head of the House Financial Services Committee. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"December 13, 2016","Is Sessions, Trump's Attorney General Pick, Trying to Paper Over His Record?"," His Republican colleagues on Capitol Hill are hoping to advance Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions' nomination to serve as U.S. attorney general at warp speed. Leaders at the Senate Judiciary Committee have already announced that confirmation hearings for the nation's next top law enforcement officer will begin Jan. 10, well before Donald Trump's inauguration. But Democrats and civil rights advocates are signaling that the path for Sessions may not be as rapid, or as smooth, as Republicans would like. Sessions, 69, returned his questionnaire to the committee amid little fanfare late last Friday evening. The former U.S. attorney and attorney general for the state of Alabama dutifully listed his employment record. But under a section asking for ""any unsuccessful candidacies you have had for elective office or unsuccessful nominations for appointed offices,"" Sessions didn't mention his failed bid for a federal judge post. Back in 1986, the Republican-led Judiciary Committee, the same panel that will consider his nomination next year, rejected him for a lifetime-tenured judgeship after lawyers testified he had a record of making racially insensitive statements. Sessions denied he was a racist, but he acknowledged he made a joke about thinking members of the KKK were all right — until he learned they smoked marijuana. At the time of his nomination last month, Trump described Sessions in a written statement as ""a world-class legal mind."" The transition team has pointed to Sessions' support for a congressional award for civil rights hero Rosa Parks; his vote for Eric Holder Jr., the first black man to serve as attorney general; and his assistance in helping the Southern Poverty Law Center to sue the Ku Klux Klan into bankruptcy in 1981. The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights isn't so certain Sessions will enforce the civil rights laws on the books. The coalition of more than 200 human rights groups wrote lawmakers earlier this month to condemn the nominee as the wrong man for the job. ""Senator Sessions has a 30-year record of racial insensitivity, bias against immigrants, disregard for the rule of law, and hostility to the protection of civil rights that makes him unfit to serve as the Attorney General of the United States,"" they wrote. Ten years after the Senate turned him away for a judgeship, Sessions was elected a U.S. senator — and he won re-election three more times. He went on to serve on the Judiciary Committee, where he vetted the records of two of President Obama's Supreme Court nominees, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who will become the panel's lead Democrat in January, sought to pump the brakes on the Sessions nomination Tuesday. She said lawmakers need more time to consider his record, which spans more than 150,000 pages. And she has yet to agree to limit the attorney general confirmation hearing to just two days. Instead, Democrats are pointing to four days of hearings the Judiciary Committee held for former Sen. John Ashcroft before he became President George W. Bush's first attorney general. Feinstein pointed out that Sessions still hasn't turned over complete information on which Republican candidates he has endorsed over the years. Nor, she wrote, has he turned over several speeches he gave on behalf of Trump on the campaign trail. ""These events, which happened only very recently, obviously are highly relevant to Senator Sessions' ability and intent to serve as an independent Attorney General,"" Feinstein wrote. ""It also appears there are other missing speeches, such as a speech at an event called 'Restoration Weekend' from 2003 and a speech at a Federation for American Immigration Reform event in 2007."" At some points during the presidential race, Sessions appeared to throw his support behind Trump's proposal to ban Muslims from entering the country. In December 2015, at a Judiciary Committee meeting, Sessions spoke out to oppose an amendment sponsored by Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy that sought to affirm that the U.S. should not bar immigrants from entering its borders based on their religion. ""With regard to immigration, it is our responsibility to protect the rights and well-being first of American citizens,"" Sessions said at the time. ""Fundamentally, foreign nationals living in foreign countries do not have a constitutional right to enter the United States. ... The goal is to select immigrants for admission based on the benefits they provide to the society, based on skills, ages, values, philosophy, income, etc."" That resolution later passed with bipartisan support, 16 to 4. And, one more thing about that questionnaire: Sessions was asked to provide the 10 most significant cases he ""personally handled"" as a lawyer. His list includes eight cases that were not listed in his 1986 judgeship materials, including four civil rights cases. But those newly listed cases date to the mid-1980s, something Democratic aides are casting as an effort by Sessions to belatedly ""rebrand"" himself as a civil rights advocate. They also question whether Sessions did much more than attach his name to legal filings, a somewhat pro forma step for U.S. attorneys. Lawmakers have already collected several letters of support for Sessions, from former Republican Justice Department leaders who described him as a ""person of unwavering dedication to the mission of the department — to assure that our country is governed by the fair and even-handed rule of law."" The Major City Chiefs Association, which represents police officials in big metropolitan areas, praised his ""storied record of service to our nation and our justice system."" Sen. Charles Grassley, the Iowa Republican who leads Judiciary, has predicted Sessions will achieve confirmation next year. ""I trust the other side will resist what some liberal interest groups are clearly hoping for — an attack on his character,"" Grassley said after Trump announced the choice. ""The confirmation process of John Ashcroft to be attorney general turned into a reckless campaign that snowballed into an avalanche of innuendo, rumor and spin. That will not happen here.""

Investigators say 28-year-old Edgar Welch spent days prior to the Dec. 4 incident at Comet Ping Pong planning the confrontation. A federal complaint filed against Welch quotes text messages mentioning ""Pizzagate,"" a baseless rumor claiming the pizzeria housed a child sex ring for Washington elites. Just two days before he entered the restaurant, Welch allegedly texted a friend his plan to raid ""a pedo ring"" where lives could ""possibly"" be lost. ""I'm sorry bro, but I'm tired of turning the channel and hoping someone does something and being thankful it's not my family. One day it will be our families. The world is too afraid to act and I'm too stubborn not to,"" the complaint says, quoting the text. In another instance, he sent a friend a link to a supposed expose on the restaurant. In a federal courthouse on Tuesday, Welch was formally charged with interstate transportation of a firearm to commit a crime. Local authorities opted not to charge Welch for the multiple weapons, including the AR-15 he fired, which he transported to D.C. from his North Carolina home. 
                The Dec. 4 incident, in which Edgar Welch is accused of entering the Comet Ping Pong restaurant and firing a rifle, has unnerved politicians and Washington locals alike.

 The Dec. 4 incident, in which Edgar Welch is accused of entering the Comet Ping Pong restaurant and firing a rifle, has unnerved politicians and Washington locals alike. Authorities have maintained Welch was motivated by the online conspiracy theory plaguing a restaurant known for its family-friendly atmosphere and live music. These new details give a sense of how closely he had followed Pizzagate. As we've previously reported, Comet Ping Pong entered the realm of conspiracy after emails uploaded to WikiLeaks showed Clinton campaign manager John Podesta referring to the restaurant. Misguided interpretations concluded ""pizza"" was code for ""pedophilia."" Fake-news sites and social networks lent the rumor longevity and reach. Even before Welch's plans to investigate, owner James Alefantis had already been receiving death threats. In an interview a week before the gunman entered his restaurant, Alefantis told NPR: ""They would go into our social media accounts and they would take photographs that were on my Instagram of my friends' children or of my associates' children and post them around thousands and thousands of fake-news sites and on reddit and on YouTube and use these images of happily playing, innocent children as proof of some kind of human trafficking scheme led by the Clintons. ... ""In the case of Comet Ping Pong, we're a beloved neighborhood institution. And so we're very strong in a way. We have great community support. If this kind of attack were leveled at an individual or a less strong small business, it would be — I think could be potentially devastating to some of these people.""

Schock, 35, entered his not guilty plea at a pre-trial hearing on Monday. He was indicted by a grand jury in November after resigning from Congress in 2015 amidst an ethics investigation. ""I look forward to all the facts coming out in this case,"" Politico reported Schock said after the hearing. ""I have full confidence in my legal team, full confidence in the good people of this community and I'm confident that in the end, justice will prevail."" The trial is set to begin in February. At the hearing, Politico also reported attorneys for both sides discussed whether Schock could use campaign bank accounts to pay legal fees: "" 'These campaign funds are potential victims of the crimes charged,' prosecutor Timothy Bass told the judge, adding that Schock shouldn't be able to continue 'unsupervised expenditures' from the accounts. ""The two sides agreed to try and work out a deal after the arraignment. Schock's three campaign accounts currently contain, in total, about $379,000. As of October, Schock had $746,000 in debts."" Schock was elected to Congress in 2008 when he was just 27 years old and a rising star in the Illinois Republican Party, as we have reported. In 2015, multiple news reports alleged inappropriate spending by Schock's office, the most damaging of which was a story in The Washington Post about his choice to turn his office into a replica of a lavish Victorian sitting room from the hit PBS show Downton Abbey. November's grand jury indictment estimated the remodeling totaled ""approximately $40,000, including the purchase of a $5,000 chandelier,"" $25,000 of which was charged to the House of Representatives. The remodeling costs were described in invoices as ""services to assist the member in setting up our district and DC offices,"" and said the Victorian lounge design included ""materials from our district and rearranging/ designing/ structuring the space to best suit the member and staff's needs."" Schock is also accused of misusing public funds to attend or profit from tickets to professional sports games, submitting false mileage expenses for ""campaign-related"" travel, hiring private planes and helicopters for personal use and submitting false expense claims for camera equipment and vehicles. U.S. Attorney Jim Lewis, who is prosecuting the case, alleged in a November statement that Schock ""generated income to himself, which resulted in a loss of more than $100,000 to the government, Schock's campaign committees and others.""

npr,"December 13, 2016",Donald Trump Taps Rick Perry To Head Agency He Once Forgot," Updated 7:51 a.m. ET Dec. 14 with official announcement of Perry's nomination. It's a good thing former Texas Gov. Rick Perry once forgot he wanted to eliminate the Department of Energy, because President-elect Donald Trump is nominating him to lead the agency. Perry, who served 14 years as governor of energy-rich Texas, blanked on the Department of Energy's name during a televised gaffe in a 2011 debate that was probably the most high-profile moment of his troubled 2012 presidential run. It's become known as the ""Oops"" moment: Perry ran again in 2016. But in an early sign of the electorate's anti-establishment mood, he and several other multiple-term governors dropped out of the race in its early stages, while Trump, a man with no prior political experience, rushed to the head of the Republican primary pack. Perry was critical of Trump, warning that he was a ""cancer on conservatism,"" but he eventually endorsed him. abc, dancing with the stars, dwts, finale, rick perry #gif #trendingGIF #meme pic.twitter.com/TznnJEvmyT In a statement, Trump said Perry would carry out his goal to ""take advantage of our huge natural resource deposits to make America energy independent and create vast new wealth for our nation."" In one of the many only-in-2016 twists, the former Texas governor appeared on Dancing With The Stars this fall as the onetime-Apprentice star contended for, and ultimately won, the White House: If confirmed, Perry would oversee a broad-reaching department with ties in everything from funding energy research and providing loans for alternative energy efforts, to tracking and analyzing American energy production and consumption, to securing the safety of America's nuclear weapons. (Despite the popularity of Netflix's summer hit Stranger Things, the Department of Energy does not explore parallel universes. It actually put out a statement about this during the show's cultural peak.) The current energy secretary, Ernest Moniz, a nuclear physicist, played a major role in negotiating and crafting the Obama administration's controversial nuclear deal with Iran. Under Obama, the department has been a big booster of alternative energy like wind and solar power. A questionnaire the Trump transition team sent to Department of Energy employees is raising a lot of questions about how the incoming administration would change the department's priorities. As NPR reported: ""It wants to know who at the Department of Energy attended domestic and international climate talks. It wants emails about those conferences. It also asks about money spent on loan-guarantee programs for renewable energy. ... The Trump team questionnaire also asks about the Energy Department's role in the Iran nuclear deal, which Trump has called 'stupid.' And it asks for the 20 highest paid employees at the department's national laboratories."" The questionnaire alarmed Democrats, like Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey, who sent a letter to Trump raising concerns that ""this request suggests that your administration may intend to retaliate against career employees who faithfully executed their responsibilities."" Trump has repeatedly expressed skepticism about wind power's cost and effectiveness. But under Perry, Texas heavily promoted wind. Massive wind farms dot the Texas landscape, and wind energy now produces more than 10 percent of the energy the state consumes.

npr,"December 13, 2016",Trump Tweets About Plans To Leave 2 Of His Children Running Businesses," President-elect Donald Trump says he plans to leave two of his children — Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump — in charge of his businesses. He also says ""no new deals will be done"" while he is in office. The statements were released via Twitter late Monday night. Trump has previously said he planned to leave his companies in the hands of his three oldest children — now, he appears to be suggesting Ivanka will be stepping back from the family business as well. Keeping the companies in the family could create unprecedented conflicts of interest, analysts say. Trump was set to hold a news conference this week to explain how, exactly, he would address potential conflicts of interest. He canceled the press conference and rescheduled it for January. His tweets amounted to the following statement: ""Even though I am not mandated by law to do so, I will be leaving my busineses [sic] before January 20th so that I can focus full time on the ... Presidency. Two of my children, Don and Eric, plus executives, will manage them. No new deals will be done during my term(s) in office."" In a subsequent tweet, the president-elect tacitly acknowledged that he had rescheduled the planned news conference, tweeting ""Busy times!"" As NPR has reported, laws that bar conflicts of interest in the executive branch do not apply to the president or vice president.

npr,"December 13, 2016",What Exactly Is The 'President's Daily Brief' And Why Is It Important?," Updated at 9:10 a.m. ET For more than 50 years, it's been a tradition at the White House — a concise daily intelligence briefing, presented to the president and a small group of top officials. It is also tradition for the winner of the presidential election to start receiving the same briefing during his transition, as a way to start preparing for the world he will face once he moves into the Oval Office. But Donald Trump, who defied all conventions of campaigning for the White House, is doing the same when it comes to the President's Daily Brief. Most days he has declined to receive the briefing, making it more of a weekly occurrence than a daily one. ""Well, I get it when I need it."" That was Trump's answer to a question posed by Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday. He then added, ""First of all, these are very good people that are giving me the briefings. If something should change from this point, immediately call me. I'm available on one minute's notice."" It does raise questions of just how Trump views the CIA and other intelligence agencies. He questioned the competence of and quality of the nation's intelligence gathering operations during the campaign and again this past week when he rejected reports that the CIA has determined Russia tried to disrupt and influence the 2016 vote in hopes of a Trump victory. The president's daily brief is the most tightly controlled daily document in the world."" David Priess, a former CIA analyst, briefer during the Bush White House and author of ""The President's Book of Secrets"" On Fox News, Trump didn't address that question specifically, instead getting back to his reasons for not getting the daily intelligence briefing, known to the president and White House staff as the PDB. ""I don't have to be told — you know, I'm, like, a smart person,"" Trump said. ""I don't have to be told the same thing and the same words every single day for the next eight years. It could be eight years — but eight years. I don't need that."" President Obama warned Trump against dismissing briefings from intelligence professionals in an interview Monday evening on Comedy Central's The Daily Show. ""If you're not getting their perspective — their detailed perspective — then you are flying blind,"" Obama said. Some background on the President's Daily Brief It has its origins in the early days of John F. Kennedy's presidency. The early 1960s were tense times for the country, and especially for those working in espionage on behalf of the U.S. The Central Intelligence Agency felt it needed a more orderly way to keep the president updated on potential crises and hot spots around the globe. Former intelligence analyst and now author David Priess said the solution was a small daily ""book"" called the Presidents Intelligence Checklist. Well, I get it when I need it."" President-elect Donald Trump to Fox News' Chris Wallace on Sunday, referring to the daily presidential intelligence briefing He describes it as ""very short, very punchy, small enough that it could be folded and put into his suit pocket."" JFK, Priess said, could easily check it and refer to it throughout the day. It took its current name, the ""President's Daily Brief,"" during President Lyndon Johnson's tenure. ""The most tightly controlled daily document in the world"" Priess, who was a briefer in the Bush administration starting in 2002, said it's hard to overstate the gravity assigned to the PDB. ""The president's daily brief is the most tightly controlled daily document in the world,"" he said. The president determines who gets to see it. During the Nixon administration, it was often limited to just two people — the president himself and his national security adviser, Henry Kissinger. Others, like George W. Bush, had it shared with top national-security staff, the attorney general, secretary of state, FBI director, his chief of staff and some others. The circle is a bit wider under President Obama, but it remains a very exclusive group. U.S. intelligence veteran Barry Pavel, who served the past two administrations, said different presidents have different preferences when it comes to the briefing. Some presidents, like George W. and George H.W. Bush, wanted the daily briefing in person, so they could ask questions on the spot. Most others, including Obama, prefer it in briefing-book form, and any questions are relayed to the appropriate agencies and experts at the CIA or elsewhere. ""A critical start to their day"" Pavel is currently the director of the Brent Scowcroft Center on International Security. (Note: Scowcroft was national security adviser to presidents Gerald Ford and George H.W. Bush). Pavel said that over the decades, presidents have often considered it ""a critical start to their day, where they have this exchange on these critical issues."" He added that it ""gets them thinking about what's going to happen that day, that month or that year."" Which brings us back to Donald Trump. Pavel said his first reaction when he heard the president-elect cite the repetitive nature of the briefing as a reason to skip it was that that can be addressed. There may need to be a new briefer — or a new approach, someone who can find a way to present the information to Trump in a way that works for this ""customer,"" as the intelligence community refers to the recipient of such a briefing. Pavel added that Trump's staff and advisers need to help out in that regard. ""Everyone has a different style,"" Pavel said, suggesting that Trump's current belief that he doesn't need the briefing every day might change in the White House. ""I would be interested to see how that posture evolves over time, because once you're in that chair and in the office, I would expect that tempo to increase significantly."" But Pavel also stressed the importance of these regular sessions with intelligence briefers during the presidential transition period. It's a way, he noted, to begin to get up to speed on the state of the world — and it's equally important to begin to establish a good relationship and rapport with intelligence officials.

npr,"December 13, 2016",Trump Announces He's Picked Rex Tillerson As Secretary Of State," This was supposed to be a week of big announcements from President-elect Donald Trump, and this morning, we have two new Cabinet picks to report on. Trump is reportedly preparing to tap former Texas Governor Rick Perry as his secretary of energy, though NPR has not independently confirmed that yet. Earlier this morning, Trump's team announced that he has chosen Rex Tillerson, the CEO of ExxonMobil, to be secretary of state. And let's bring in NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson to talk about this. Morning, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, David. GREENE: So we're just getting word of these reports that Rick Perry is secretary of energy, former Texas governor, once presidential hopeful himself. What do you make of this? LIASSON: Well, he's from an oil-and-gas state. He sits on some energy company boards. However, he used to be a real stark, strong critic of Donald Trump. He called him a barking carnival act and a cancer on conservatism. But when it comes... GREENE: That's not holding back. LIASSON: (Laughter) No. But when - later he endorsed him and campaigned very enthusiastically for him. But what he's most famous for, when it comes to the Department of Energy, was this famous clip from a 2012 - 2011 debate when he was running for the Republican presidential nomination for the 2012 election. And here's what he said about what he would do to reform government if he was president. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RICK PERRY: It's three agencies of government, when I get there, that are gone - commerce, education and the - what's the third one there? Let's see. (LAUGHTER) LIASSON: That's known as the oops moment. That third one was the Department of Energy. Now he's going to run it, which he... GREENE: Which he's theoretically going to be leading. LIASSON: ...Wanted to get rid of. Yes, he wanted to get rid of it. Now he's going to lead it. And the Department of Energy is more than just about oil and gas. It also manages the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile and runs programs on nuclear nonproliferation and counterterrorism. And the last energy secretary, the current energy secretary, is a nuclear physicist. So it's a lot more than just fossil fuels... GREENE: OK, so... LIASSON: ...And nuclear energy. GREENE: ...Sitting on some boards of companies, you say, and that brings up the next pick, which is Trump choosing Rex Tillerson to lead the State Department. He certainly knows about companies. He's ExxonMobil's CEO. But what - let's look at this broadly, Mara. What happened to Mitt Romney? A very different choice. LIASSON: Well, Mitt Romney would have been a very different choice. He's kind of the path not taken. He famously said that Russia was the United States number one geopolitical foe. Rex Tillerson seems to be more in line with Donald Trump's approach to Russia. He advocated a much friendlier role to Russia during the campaign. He has been consistently complimentary of Vladimir Putin. Several of his advisers have ties to the Putin government, and Russian diplomats said they were in touch with the Trump campaign all throughout the election, although the Trump campaign has denied that. And Donald Trump famously called on Vladimir Putin to hack into Hillary Clinton's emails. So this could be a reset - a more robust reset - towards Russia than anything ever tried by the Obama administration because Rex Tillerson is known as the friendliest CEO to Vladimir Putin. He got the Russian award of friendship. He does a lot of deals in Russia, a lot of oil and gas deals. So this could represent a big split between Donald Trump and the majority of Republicans and national security professionals who feel that Russian aggression in Europe and elsewhere needs to be checked, not accommodated. GREENE: OK. So people who are worried about that when it comes to both Donald Trump and what he has said about Vladimir Putin and also Tillerson's ties to Russia, there will be a confirmation hearing. I would imagine this is a time when a lot of senators, including Republicans, could bring some of that up. LIASSON: Yes, and I think they will, although the Trump administration-in-waiting has lined up a lot of establishment figures to vouch for Tillerson, including Bob Gates, Condoleezza Rice, who run a consulting company where ExxonMobil is one of their clients, and Dick Cheney and Jim Baker. But there has been pushback from Republican senators, from Lindsey Graham... (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE RINGING) LIASSON: ...And even from Marco Rubio. GREENE: If you have to get that, Mara, it's OK. LIASSON: Yeah, thank you very much - sorry about that - from Marco Rubio who actually said today he thinks the secretary of state needs to have moral clarity and no conflicts of interest and he has serious concerns about Tillerson. So this - these hearings for Tillerson, or the announcement of Tillerson, come just as Congress is gearing up to look into Russian hacking of political operatives during the election, something that Donald Trump - a conclusion widely held by the intelligence community but one that Donald Trump has adamantly rejected. He says I don't believe Russia hacked. So you're going to have these two forces coming together, Donald Trump's view of Russia, his nomination of Tillerson and congressional skepticism. GREENE: And we should just say briefly one event that we are not expecting this week that we were expecting at one point was Trump having a press conference to talk about how he's going to avoid conflicts of interest with his businesses when he's president. LIASSON: Nope. He's not going to do it. He says he'll do it in January. But he says he's not divesting. His sons will manage the business, and he won't do any new deals while he's president. GREENE: OK. That's NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Mara, thanks a lot. LIASSON: Thanks a lot. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"December 13, 2016",Sen. John McCain Weighs In On Threats To U.S. Posed By Russia," JOHN MCCAIN: This issue of the campaign and their interference there is only a small part of our whole issue regarding cyber and our capabilities or lack of. GREENE: Now, President-elect Trump called the CIA conclusion into question, tweeting out this comment - (reading) can you imagine if the election results were the opposite and we tried to play the Russia-CIA card? It would be called conspiracy theory. That's the end of the quoted tweet there. Senator McCain told Steve Inskeep that he is looking to Trump's advisors, like two key Cabinet picks, retired General James Mattis and retired General John Kelly, to help turn Trump around on this issue. MCCAIN: What I can hope is that the people around the president will convince him that this is an issue that is - has to have the highest level of attention. STEVE INSKEEP, BYLINE: Do you want a select committee, a special committee of some kind or something like the 9/11 investigation that would have very broad powers to examine what has happened to the United States here and what could happen in the future? MCCAIN: Right now, it is the view of both Senator Schumer and Senator McConnell - and I agree - that we have the Armed Services Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Foreign Relations Committee, both chairmen and ranking members and the members going at this issue, and we will coordinate. I am good friends with both of them. We will coordinate. I'm setting up a subcommittee on cyber, not just to examine this issue and what happened and what needs to be done, but on the overall issue of cyber. INSKEEP: How concerned are you about the threat that Russia poses to the United States? MCCAIN: I think that Vladimir Putin is playing a weak hand with great intelligence and very cleverly. I think that when you look at what he's been able to do in the last eight years, it's almost astounding - now playing a major role in the Middle East, which Russia had no role since 1973 when Anwar Sadat threw them out of Egypt, the dismemberment of Ukraine, the continued threats and attempts to destabilize the Baltics. His behavior has been, in my view, just outrageous. And by the way, what's really egregious is now the precision strikes that Russian aircraft are dropping - precision weapons on hospitals in Aleppo. I mean, there is no depths that these people won't plummet. And so... INSKEEP: You - you believe that those strikes that have killed many civilians in Aleppo are not indiscriminate but actually targeted on civilians? MCCAIN: I know for a fact they're using precision weapons. I know that for a fact. And so when those precision weapons hit a hospital, you can only draw one conclusion. INSKEEP: Senator, as you know, the president-elect has raised the possibility of Rex Tillerson of Exxon... MCCAIN: Yes. INSKEEP: ExxonMobil as a possible secretary of state. He's been criticized because he's been friendly with President Putin. He's done business deals with Putin. What's wrong with that, though? He knows the guy. MCCAIN: I think it depends on whether he condones the behavior that I just talked about. Did he ever raise those issues with Vladimir Putin? Is it strictly business? I think these are legitimate questions. By the way, I am not making a judgment about Mr. Tillerson. I will wait, and the questions will be asked. That's why we have hearings, advice and consent. And I will withhold judgment, but I think that I have concerns about what kind of business we do with a butcher, a murderer and a thug, which is exactly what Vladimir Putin is. INSKEEP: We are getting a sense of a group of senators who have expressed concerns about the president-elect's views toward Russia and, more broadly, about his foreign policy. Is there any coordination among those of you in the Senate on the Republican side who have these concerns? MCCAIN: No, and - not - not that I'm aware of. Look, we want the president-elect to succeed. We respect the outcome of the election. He is now the president of United States. I want to work with him for the good of the nation and security of this nation. I think there's more challenges than we've experienced in 70 years when you look around the world. INSKEEP: One last thing, Senator, and I'll let you go. The president-elect has dismissed most of his offered intelligence briefings and said on television over the weekend that they weren't of much value to him. He's just being told the same thing over and over again and because he's a smart guy, he doesn't need that. I'm presuming that as chairman of the Armed Services Committee and, once upon a time, as a presidential nominee, that you've received a lot of classified briefings. What value were they, if any? MCCAIN: I think they're important. I think it's important for the - for the president of the United States to be aware of the intelligence information that we have. There have been times in our history at which he and others are quick to point out, such as weapons of mass destruction. But overall, our intelligence services over time have been, generally, mostly accurate. And we need them, and the President of the United States, I believe, can benefit from them. But I'm not in the mood to tell the president of United States what he should and shouldn't do. I'm just not going to do that. INSKEEP: I'm just curious if those briefings, having been in them, are valuable. Do you hear the same thing over and over again, or do you learn things? MCCAIN: A lot of times you do hear the same thing over and over again, but sometimes, I think, when they're of the utmost seriousness, it's beneficial to hear them more than once. So we'll see how he evolves, but the fact remains he was smart enough and good enough to be elected president of the United States, something that yours truly was - wasn't able to achieve (laughter). INSKEEP: Well, Senator McCain, thanks for taking the time. I really appreciate it. MCCAIN: It's good to talk to you again. Bye-bye. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: That was Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona. He is chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and he was speaking to our colleague, Steve Inskeep.

npr,"December 13, 2016",Sen. Rand Paul Pushes For Probe Into Russia's Election Hacking," RAND PAUL: I can tell you in my state of Kentucky, 70 percent of eastern Kentucky voted for Donald Trump not because the Russians told them to but because they were upset with the war on coal regulations coming from President Obama and from Hillary Clinton. So we voted our own self-interests. We - it had nothing to do with Russians. And so I think it'd be a mistake to blame the election on the Russians. But at the same time, I think any kind of threat of cyberterrorism we ought to take seriously. GREENE: So just to be very clear here, I mean, you're suggesting some might be politicizing this and suggesting Donald Trump was elected because of this. That aside, you do believe the CIA's assertion that Russia was trying to influence the outcome of this election. PAUL: I have actually no evidence other than what I see on the news. I have no extraordinary information that I've gotten through any kind of briefing to say that the Russians did anything. You know, what I've read in the press is that they say there might be Russian fingerprints on this. So, yeah, we should investigate it is all I'm saying. GREENE: Your colleague John McCain, Republican from Arizona, suggested that if what the CIA is saying is true that this was an act of warfare from Russia. You agree with that? PAUL: You know, I think that's a little bit oversimplified, to tell you the truth. Foreign countries are always trying to hack into each other, and I'm assuming that we do some of the same. So I don't know that it's extraordinary that Russia might be trying to do this. The reason I think we should investigate it is so we can protect our national security interests. And, you know, some of this should be a warning just to individuals. Apparently, the Hillary Clinton campaign was very sloppy with this. They, you know, one of their - I think their campaign manager sent a password via email, and, you know, every high school student is told not to do things like that, not to... GREENE: Are you suggesting that the Clinton campaign somehow invited this Russian hack? PAUL: No. I'm saying that it was sloppy work, and we all need to learn from people who - you know, you're not supposed to send your password by email. So you cause yourself to be vulnerable to anybody, whether it's Russia, China or thieves. GREENE: You were a candidate in this election in the Republican primary. Do you know if Russia hacked into your systems? PAUL: No. GREENE: They didn't or you don't know the answer to the question? PAUL: No, nobody's ever made that insinuation, so that's the first I've ever heard anybody ask about. But no, I have no evidence that anybody's ever hacked into my email or anything with our campaign. GREENE: You've had some pretty tough language over the course of the last few days about John Bolton, who has been talked about as being nominated by Donald Trump for a top job in the State Department. He was George W. Bush's U.N. ambassador. You've said that you will block his nomination in committee. Why are you firmly against him? PAUL: Well, he's part of promoting the false data that there were WMDs in Iraq. He was a big promoter of the Iraq War but continues to be an apologist for it. So he hasn't learned any of the lessons in the last 15 years. He was a promoter of regime change in Libya, which actually made us less safe, and he's been in favor of regime change in Syria as well. He's not only for regime change in Iran; he actually advocates Israel using nuclear weapons on Iran to prevent them from getting a nuclear weapon. So no, I think he's way outside the mainstream and really has a naive understanding of the world. I think he's a real danger to the world. So I will be a no vote for him for any position in the State Department. GREENE: Which we should say on a very tightly - tight committee with almost as many Democrats as Republicans. I mean, you could effectively block his nomination from reaching the floor. I mean, I wonder, you know, as a Republican, you're not alone in wanting the Russian hack investigated. You're not alone in raising some concerns about Trump's potential nominees. President Obama was seen by your party as going beyond his executive authority. Is this a sign that your party is ready to do the same, to try and limit Donald Trump? PAUL: Well, many of us do believe in the separation of powers. One of my chief complaints up here for any president has been that our founding fathers were very clear that war is not initiated or declared without the authority of Congress. And we still haven't declared war on the Middle East, and they're using the 9/11 proclamation on getting those who attacked us on 9/11, which it's ridiculous to say that has anything to do with what we're doing in the Middle East now. So yes, I'll continue to advocate for Congress asserting its role, for not letting the president run amok through executive order. Domestically, most of that has been an overreach by President Obama, though, instituting regulations that could have never gotten through Congress. And I am confident that I think in the first hundred days we'll get dozens and dozens, hopefully, of onerous job-killing regulations removed. GREENE: What's one regulation that would give people an idea of what you're talking about, a single regulation that you can really point to and you think limits jobs? PAUL: There's a regulation called Waters of the U.S. There was a cattle rancher, Andy Johnson, out in Fort Bridger, Wyo. He was fined $37,000 a day for building a cattle pond that he had a local permit for. You should not have to get a federal permit to build a cattle pond. This is the kind of thing that has kind of run amok in our country is the federal government trying to regulate individual local issues like land use. GREENE: Do you see the other side of that an effort to protect the environment? I mean, is there some middle ground you might be able to find when some of these debates happen? PAUL: Yeah. I don't think cattle ponds are really hurting the environment any. And I don't think that people who live in Hollywood care that much about, you know, a cattle pond in Kentucky. I think we care more about it. And you won't find anybody who lives in the mountains of Kentucky that isn't worried about the environment and worried about clean water. They also realize that regulations have to be balanced with the economy, that if you lived in a perfect society and there was no emissions from cars, there'd be no cars. If there were no emissions from power plants, there'd be no power plants. So it is a trade-off in finding a balancing act. And the pendulum has swung too far such that it's damaged our economy and our way of life in Kentucky. And so we are kind of tired of people who don't live in Kentucky telling us what to do, and we think that our local environmental protection in Kentucky can do a much better job than anybody out of Washington. GREENE: All right. We'll leave it there. Senator Paul, thanks as always, nice talking to you. PAUL: Thank you. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"December 13, 2016",Trump Picks Rex Tillerson To Lead The State Department," It's official - President-elect Trump has announced he intends to nominate ExxonMobil chairman and CEO Rex Tillerson as his secretary of state. For more we're going to turn now to NPR's Michele Kelemen. Good morning, Michele. MICHELE KELEMEN, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel. MARTIN: We know Tillerson is a career oil executive, presumably he's had a lot of global dealings in that role. Well, bottom lines are different than diplomatic interests. What qualifies him for this post? KELEMEN: That's right. I mean, as you said, he joined Exxon back in 1975. He's a Texan who spent his entire career there, though he has traveled and worked in, you know, many countries around the world. He's hitting retirement age 65 next year, so there are big changes ahead if he's confirmed for this job. For one, a big pay cut but also a very different job. He's used to running a company that's larger than the economies of most countries. Steve Coll, who wrote a book about ExxonMobil, described it this way when he spoke to NPR's weekend All Things Considered. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) STEVE COLL: The oil industry is a different industry compared to the typical ones that produce national leadership. ExxonMobil is a very large corporation. It operates all over the world negotiating with leaders on behalf of its shareholders. It's kind of a parallel quasi-state. KELEMEN: You know, Coll said that in many situations ExxonMobil is actually more influential than the State Department. He gave an example of, you know, being in the African nation of Chad. Even Iraq, where ExxonMobil cut a deal with the Kurdish government in the north. That was a move that rankled U.S. diplomats and put them at odds with the State Department's policy. So, you know, we could probably expect some real culture clashes ahead to say the least. MARTIN: Yeah. Let's talk about his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. They've known each other for decades in business dealings. Is that likely to help or hinder Tillerson's prospects for confirmation in the Senate? KELEMEN: I think there will be a lot of questions about that in the Senate hearings, particularly because, you know, this comes at a time when intelligence agencies are raising concerns about Russian hacking in the U.S. We're witnessing atrocities in the Syrian city of Aleppo as Russia and Iran help the Syrian regime recapture territory from rebels. You know, these are all questions that both Democrats and Republicans on the Foreign Relations Committee are likely to raise with Tillerson. Another big one is what a Trump administration might do with sanctions over Russia's actions in Ukraine. You know, Tillerson opposed them in part because sanctions slowed down a joint project that ExxonMobil had with Rosneft to drill in the Arctic. MARTIN: The current Secretary John Kerry has spent a lot of time on efforts to address climate change. Trump is on the record as a climate change skeptic. What do we know about Tillerson's views? KELEMEN: Well, we know that ExxonMobil has acknowledged that climate change is real. But at the same time it's facing legal battles now over how much it knew beforehand and whether it misled investors and the public about this. So environmental groups are very nervous about this pick, what it'll mean to the Paris climate accord which is now in effect and what it could mean in the future for projects like the Keystone XL pipeline, which the State Department environmental review was one of the big problems there. MARTIN: So of course there's all kinds of conversations about conflicts of interest. And yesterday I spoke with Ed Verona, who's a former vice president for ExxonMobil Russia. He knows Tillerson. I want to play this clip. He doesn't think conflicts of interest will be a problem for the nominee. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) EDWARD VERONA: And anyone who has been CEO of ExxonMobil does not retire without considerable personal wealth, which he has. So I don't think he would be, let's say, seduced by the possibility of enhancing the position of his company. MARTIN: So saying he's wealthy enough that it's not going to affect his decision making. But is there a precedent, Michele, just briefly, for a corporate CEO taking this job? KELEMEN: Well, Reagan's Secretary of State George Shultz was an executive with Bechtel. So he came from the private sector but he worked in government. But what we'll likely see is divestment. John Kerry divested, Colin Powell divested to distance themselves from business interests that could become a conflict of interest at the State Department. MARTIN: NPR's State Department correspondent Michele Kelemen. Thanks, Michele. KELEMEN: Thank you. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"December 13, 2016",Trump's Election Leaves Scientists In A Climate Of Uncertainty," Thousands of Earth scientists are in San Francisco this week to talk about climate change, volcanoes and earthquakes. And another tectonic topic: President-elect Donald Trump. As president, Trump will oversee a huge government scientific enterprise. Agencies like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and NASA have satellites collecting valuable data on the climate. Other agencies employ scientists studying that data, or modeling future climate shifts. Scientists attending the American Geophysical Union's fall meeting are worried Trump could have a profound effect on the effort to understand climate, and not in what they consider a good way. Peter de Menocal, dean of science at Columbia University, says he has heard colleagues express ""feelings of rage, anger, confusion, fear — they're all negative emotions."" ""People are worried about — in extreme cases — their jobs,"" adds Rob Jackson, an environmental scientist at Stanford University. But, he says: ""They're more worried about not being able to do their job the best way that is needed."" Trump has sent contradictory signals about how he regards climate science. He tweeted that climate change is a hoax. Many of his advisers and Cabinet picks, including his pick for administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, doubt that climate change is a serious problem. On the other hand, Trump met with former Vice President Al Gore to talk about climate, and he has said he's open to the Paris climate agreement. Margaret Leinen, the president of the American Geophysical Union, says that leaves many scientists confused about what Trump will mean for their work. ""President-elect Trump didn't have a big science agenda. That left a vacuum of uncertainty,"" she says. Recent signals from the Trump transition team are not reassuring. Last week, it emerged they had sent a questionnaire to Department of Energy staff looking for people who've worked on climate science. Some fear agency scientists and officials might be targeted. And a Trump campaign adviser wrote that NASA should spend less on its armada of satellites that observe Earth — and more on exploring outer space. Former NASA climate scientist Drew Shindell says that would be a mistake. ""A shift away from focusing on data for this planet could really leave us in the dark on how to respond to climate change,"" he says. Moreover, Earth observations contribute to public safety and the economy, he says. ""The same satellites that look down and tell us about ... climate, are the ones that tell us about storms and agriculture."" Shindell is a professor at Duke University now. He says researchers everywhere depend on scientists inside the government who gather data. And those scientists are vulnerable. Ecologist Jim Estes worked at the U.S. Geological Survey during George W. Bush's presidency. He says in 2005, USGS suddenly decided that its scientists should submit their research to political overseers before sending it out to scientific journals. ""It just smacked to me of scientific censorship,"" Estes says. ""It provided a vehicle by which the agency could control scientists. No one liked it, but none of them would stand up and resist."" Federal agencies have now adopted rules to protect their scientists. But Estes says under the Obama administration, government scientists haven't always been encouraged to speak publicly. Estes says he is especially worried about Trump, though. ""This guy is such a chameleon, you have no idea what the hell is going to happen,"" he says. That's what people at the AGU meeting are trying to figure out. AGU's Leinen, who runs the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC, San Diego, says it's worth noting that previous presidents have changed their minds. She was a senior official at the National Science Foundation when George W. Bush moved into the White House. ""There were several things that he said on the campaign trail regarding the environment and climate which eventually ... were moderated,"" she says. Thanks in part to knowledgeable advisers, President Bush eventually acknowledged that humans are changing the climate. Leinen added a last-minute session here to talk about Trump. But she'd also like the opportunity to talk to Trump face to face about climate. Others here at the meeting have decided not to wait. They've organized something you don't often see from scientists: a public demonstration later today to tell Trump not to interfere with climate science.

npr,"December 13, 2016","What We Know About Rex Tillerson, Trump's Pick For Secretary Of State"," President-elect Donald Trump, in a statement early this morning, announced his intention to nominate ExxonMobil chairman and CEO Rex Tillerson to lead the State Department and become the country's top diplomat. The selection, which had been rumored for the past week, is unusual in a number of ways, and could face more scrutiny than usual when the Senate holds confirmation hearings. Here are some key facts about the president-elect's nominee for the final major position to be filled in his Cabinet: Tillerson never has worked for the government — or anyone other than Exxon since 1975 Tillerson is the Wichita Falls, Texas-born son of a Boy Scouts of America administrator who rose to become an Eagle Scout himself, Steve Coll told NPR's Michel Martin. He joined Exxon Co., U.S.A. shortly after earning a Bachelor of Science degree in civil engineering from the University of Texas at Austin. He never left, working his way up through the ranks to eventually lead the company. The selection of a private-sector executive as secretary of state has happened before, The Wall Street Journal notes, with Bechtel executive George Shultz serving under Reagan — but Shultz had previously served as secretary of labor and Treasury secretary. Still, Coll notes in a New Yorker piece that the oil giant runs a very State Department-like team of analysts that predicts which countries will remain stable enough to ensure profitable investment. And The Washington Post's Philip Rucker reported late Monday that Tillerson came with recommendations from former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Council on Foreign Relations president Richard Haass told NPR's David Greene that the selection could work, with the right support. ""There's some difference between knowing about the world and knowing about foreign policy,"" Haass said. ""He'd obviously need to surround himself with people who had experience on the ground inside the department and around the inter-agency process.""

 Russian President Vladimir Putin (right) and ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson (left) attend a signing ceremony of an agreement between state-controlled Russian oil company Rosneft and ExxonMobil in 2012 at the Black Sea port of Tuapse, southern Russia. He's had extensive dealings with Russia — which may complicate his confirmation Tillerson spent much of his ExxonMobil career in the company's international division, Coll told NPR, developing ties to countries around the world — particularly Russia. ""That brought him into contact with Vladimir Putin,"" Coll said. ""ExxonMobil is one of the few American oil companies that has managed to stay in Russia through all kinds of political weather."" Tillerson developed close ties to state-run oil company Rosneft, NPR's Lucian Kim reports, and had reached agreements to run development projects with Rosneft in Siberia and the Russian Arctic. Those projects came to a halt when the U.S. imposed economic sanctions following Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. But the agreements left him with a good reputation in the country. "" 'The Russians respect strength, and they see it in ExxonMobil and Rex Tillerson. They like him,' Edward Verona, a former ExxonMobil Russia vice president, told NPR. 'Putin likes that personality type — not exactly the Trump personality, but the personality that quietly projects power, discipline, control. ... It's a pretty good example of diplomacy, alliance-building, seeing who your friends are and what they can do for you. It was pretty shrewd deal-making.' "" Following CIA allegations of Russian hacking to benefit Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign, Tillerson will have to explain those ties to senators if he's to be confirmed, CFR's Haass told NPR. ""He would have to say, 'Here's why I did what I did at the time. Here's how I'm going to separate myself from it now. Here's how I view Russia and how I would approach policy toward Russia.' So this is now probably the biggest single set of questions he would have to tackle.""

 Oil trucks line up in April 2013 at the Bazian refinery near the city of Sulaymaniyah in the semi-autonomous Kurdish region of northern Iraq. ExxonMobil was one of several oil companies to negotiate with the regional government, despite opposition from Baghdad and the United States. The diplomatic goals of Tillerson's company haven't always lined up with those of his government The post-Crimea sanctions were not the first time ExxonMobil's goals were at cross-purposes with those of the United States, Coll told NPR. ""ExxonMobil is a very large corporation that really sees itself as an independent sovereign in the world. It has revenue the size of the economy of South Africa. It operates all over the world, negotiating with leaders on behalf of its shareholders. It's kind of a parallel quasi-state."" Exxon operates in more than 50 different countries, The New York Times reports; Tillerson became an important figure in nations around the world, Coll wrote in The New Yorker. He offered the example of ExxonMobil's business activity in the African nation of Chad: ""During the mid-two-thousands, the entirety of U.S. aid and military spending in the country directed through the U.S. Embassy in the capital, N'Djamena, amounted to less than twenty million dollars annually, whereas the royalty payments Exxon made to the government as part of an oil-production agreement were north of five hundred million dollars. Idriss Déby, the authoritarian President of Chad, did not need a calculator to understand that Rex Tillerson was more important to his future than the U.S. Secretary of State. ""In Kurdistan, during the Obama Administration, Tillerson defied State Department policy and cut an independent oil deal with the Kurdish Regional Government, undermining the national Iraqi government in Baghdad. ExxonMobil did not ask permission. After the fact, Tillerson arranged a conference call with State Department officials and explained his actions, according to my sources, by saying, 'I had to do what was best for my shareholders.'

npr,"December 12, 2016",What Will Trump's Twitter Strategy Be When He Becomes President?," Since winning this year's presidential election, Donald Trump has given the American public no shortage of outbursts, public disputes and grandiose declarations on Twitter. Just this week, he questioned the veracity of CIA reports alleging Russian influence and hacking with the goal of helping Trump win the presidency. He has picked fights with The New York Times, CNN, Saturday Night Live, and Americans who would burn the American flag. Trump has called the Air Force One program too expensive, questioned America's China policy, and made allegations of widespread voter fraud (with no evidence supporting the claim). He also has bragged about making business deals with the likes of Lincoln, Carrier and a Japanese mogul. Trump claims these will save or create tens of thousands of jobs, though as more details emerge, the deals seem a lot less advantageous for American workers than the president-elect initially implied. All this has been done from Trump's Twitter account. Throughout the tweets, one thing has become clear: Donald Trump has become even more emboldened in his use of the social media platform since defeating Hillary Clinton. Trump seems to be uniquely adept at using Twitter to control a news cycle, bypass traditional press and capture the country's attention. But as his inauguration draws closer, a new question emerges: What, if anything, might make Donald Trump change his Twitter habits? The answer might be the presidency itself. Cybersecurity protocols for a presidential smartphone will mean Trump's official smartphone once he's in the White House will be a bare-bones, stripped-down, ultra-secure device. President Obama joked about just how basic such a device is during a summer appearance on NBC's Tonight Show. ""It doesn't take pictures, you can't text,"" Obama told Jimmy Fallon. ""The phone doesn't work. You can't play your music on it. So, basically, it's like — does your 3-year-old have one of those play phones?"" Several cybersecurity experts told NPR that it's highly unlikely intelligence personnel will recommend use of the Twitter mobile app on Trump's government smartphone. ""I don't think it'd be possible to do that on a secured phone, at least with the security policy that they had for Obama's phone,"" says Martin Alderson, co-founder of mobile security company Codified Security. ""I think that the Twitter app would be too hard to lock down."" That's especially true, he said, with Android phones, where gaps in mobile app security take longer to patch than on Apple devices. Alderson suggests Trump could start dictating tweets to a staffer once he's president. ""I think usually what we'd probably see is perhaps an aide doing it for him on his behalf from a more secured laptop [or desktop] computer,"" Alderson says. This could mean that Trump might tweet less, and avoid tweeting early in the morning or late at night as he does now. Having a staffer serve as a filter for tweets could change the tone of what he's writing as well. But Trump also could choose to use his own device in addition to the official presidential smartphone, says Tom Pageler, a former Secret Service agent who's now chief risk and security officer at technology company Neustar. The National Security Agency, Secret Service and White House Communications Agency will advise the incoming president on suggested security measures, Pageler says, but ultimately, the president can make his own smartphone decisions. ""Together they will advise the president of safety [protocols] that they should take, maybe disabling a GPS,"" Pageler says. ""However, the president can do what they want. They're still a person. ... In this case he [President-elect Trump] definitely has the trump card."" A representative from the Defense Information Systems Agency told NPR that until Trump is inaugurated, his transition team would handle questions related to his devices and social media use. Trump's transition team did not respond to NPR's requests for an interview on this topic. If historical precedent is any guide, we should expect Donald Trump to keep tweeting — presidents always look for ways to bypass traditional media. The White House Correspondents' Association has complained, for example, that President Obama's reliance on official White House photographer Pete Souza resulted in photojournalists being excluded from events involving the president. Trump's tweeting is just the latest example of that desire to control the message — and if it continues to work for him, why would he let it go?

npr,"December 12, 2016",Former Rep. Chaka Fattah Sentenced To 10 Years For 'White-Collar Crime Spree'," A federal jury has sentenced former Rep. Chaka Fattah to 10 years in prison for 23 counts of conspiracy, fraud, bribery and money laundering in a series of elaborate schemes that misappropriated funds. Prosecutors say Fattah engaged in a ""white collar crime spree,"" as WHYY's Aaron Moselle tells our Newscast unit, and expect that Fattah will serve most of his 10-year sentence in addition to paying over $600,000 in restitution. ""For him, now, to be sitting in prison, that's a significant signal to those who are thinking of engaging in this conduct about what can happen if they do so,"" Zane David Memeger, U.S. attorney for the eastern district of Pennsylvania, told Moselle. Some of Fattah's crimes were connected to his failed bid to become Philadelphia's mayor in 2007, after which he was deeply in debt. ""In June, a federal jury found that Fattah stole hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars and charitable donations to help repay part of an illegal campaign loan,"" Moselle says. ""The panel also said Fattah accepted bribes from a friend who wanted to become a U.S. ambassador and used campaign cash to help his son pay off some of his college loan debt."" Fattah's lawyers repeatedly denied the charges during the trial, saying that Fattah's associates were actually to blame, WHYY reports. They said that ""Fattah's name or signature couldn't be found on any documents"" and they plan to appeal. ""The investigation and the trial has been the most disappointing event in my now 60-year life,"" the 11-term lawmaker told U.S. District Judge Harvey Bartle III in court, according to The Philadelphia Inquirer. ""I've helped tens of millions of people and that has nothing to do with the fact that I have been found on the wrong side of these questions by a jury."" But Bartle said he found the crimes ""astonishing"" and ordered Fattah to begin serving his 10-year sentence on Jan. 25, the newspaper reported. ""You abused the trust they placed in you time and time again,"" the judge said, according to the Inquirer. ""Your flagrant behavior undermines the confidence of the citizenry in all public institutions."" Fattah's political career has crumbled as a result of this trial; he lost the Democratic primary race in April, and he resigned from Congress in June after he was convicted.

npr,"December 12, 2016","Under Trump, Whither The Daily Intelligence Briefing?"," For more than 50 years, it's been a tradition at the White House - a concise, daily intelligence briefing given to the president. It's also been a tradition for president-elect to receive the same briefing. Donald Trump, however, has had only a handful of these sessions. He's been delegating them so far to his vice president-elect. NPR's Don Gonyea explains. DON GONYEA, BYLINE: First some background on what exactly the Presidential Daily Brief is. DAVID PRIESS: The President's Daily Brief is the most tightly controlled daily document in the world. GONYEA: That's former intelligence official David Priess, who has written a book about the so-called PDB after being a briefer in the George W. Bush White House. He says the tradition started with John F. Kennedy. PRIESS: So they produced a daily book, then called the President's Intelligence Checklist, which was very short, very punchy, small enough that it could be folded and put into his suit pocket. And he would go back to it later in the day. GONYEA: It officially got the name President's Daily Brief under President Johnson. During some administrations, as few as two or three people were given access to it. Most typically the number will be up to a dozen or more, but it is still a very exclusive group. U.S. intelligence veteran Barry Pavel, who served the past two administrations, says different presidents have different preferences when it comes to the briefing. Some like it in written form - that's President Obama's way - while George W. Bush wanted it in person. BARRY PAVEL: And some consider it really, you know, a critical start to their day, where they have this exchange on these critical issues. And it gets them thinking about not just what's going to happen that day but that month, that year. GONYEA: Which brings us to President-elect Trump. He's had very few of the daily intelligence briefings. He was asked about that yesterday on ""Fox News Sunday."" (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""FOX NEWS SUNDAY"") CHRIS WALLACE: You are getting the Presidential Daily Brief... DONALD TRUMP: Yes. WALLACE: ...Only once a week. TRUMP: Well, I get it when I need it. WALLACE: But is it - is there some skepticism? TRUMP: I get it when I - first of all, these are very good people that are giving me the briefings. GONYEA: But Trump cited the repetitive nature of the briefings, saying he can be updated when things change. Former intelligence analyst Pavel says it's up to the intelligence agencies and Trump's advisers to figure out a way to make these briefings work for him. PAVEL: Everyone has a different style, and so that's his current posture. I would be interested in seeing how that posture evolves over time because I think it's hard once you're in the chair and in the Oval Office. I think I would expect that tempo to increase significantly. GONYEA: Pavel says the briefing's style or even the briefers themselves may need to change. But he stresses that the sessions are important starting with the transition that's already well underway. Don Gonyea, NPR News, Washington. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"December 12, 2016",Trump Discounts CIA As Fellow Republicans Call For Investigation Into Russian Hacking," Did hackers working for the Russian government put a thumb on the scale of this year's presidential race? That's a question some Senate Republicans and Democrats now want to investigate. And according to a U.S. official, the CIA has concluded that Russia did deliberately try to swing the election in favor of Donald Trump. The president-elect disputes that claim and says it all comes from hard feelings. NPR's Scott Horsley reports. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: To Donald Trump, allegations of Russian meddling in the U.S. presidential campaign are just sour grapes, one more way for disgruntled Democrats to explain away his upset victory in last month's election. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""FOX NEWS SUNDAY"") DONALD TRUMP: I think is ridiculous. I think it's just another excuse. I don't believe it. HORSLEY: Trump said on ""Fox News Sunday"" nobody knows if Russia played a role in political cyber-attacks. In a tweet this morning, he added, why wasn't this brought up before the election? In fact, the U.S. intelligence community announced their suspicion in early October that senior officials in the Russian government had authorized a cyber-attack on the Democratic National Committee and other organizations. At the time, intelligence officials said only that Russia was trying to interfere with the U.S. election process. Now with the help of new information, the CIA has gone further. According to a U.S. official, the CIA believes Russia was trying to tip the election in Trump's favor. White House Spokesman Josh Earnest argues that's not much of a surprise. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOSH EARNEST: You didn't need a security clearance to figure out who benefited from malicious Russian cyber-activity. HORSLEY: Earnest notes that hackers and their helpers only published embarrassing emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign, not their counterparts on the Republican side. Earnest says there's no evidence Russian hackers interfered with the actual casting or counting of votes on Election Day, but President Obama has ordered a full investigation. There have also been calls for congressional inquiries. Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell says any breach of American cybersecurity is disturbing. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MITCH MCCONNELL: Now, I think we ought to approach all of these issues on the assumption that the Russians do not wish us well. HORSLEY: McConnell stopped short, however, of endorsing the CIA's conclusion that Russia was deliberately helping the Republican presidential candidate. McConnell says any claim that goes beyond what intelligence agencies said publicly in October is irresponsible, likely illegal and potentially motivated by partisan politics. The CIA has not been joined by other intelligence agencies, including the FBI. Lawmakers from both parties have voiced concerns about Russia, and that could spell trouble for ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, who's said to be at the top of Trump's list for the secretary of state's job. GOP Senators John McCain and Marco Rubio have complained publicly about Tillerson's close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, but Trump told ""Fox News Sunday"" the CEO's vast business dealings in Russia are a plus. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""FOX NEWS SUNDAY"") TRUMP: He's much more than a business executive. I mean he's a world-class player. HORSLEY: Trump continues to downplay warnings about Russia from his fellow Republicans and intelligence experts. His team issued a statement over the weekend dismissing intelligence officials as, quote, ""the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction."" White House Spokesman Earnest argues Trump should listen to what the intelligence experts are saying. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) EARNEST: These are men and women who dedicate themselves to this cause because they love this country. The president-elect would benefit from that advice if he remains open to it. HORSLEY: For now, Trump is skipping most intelligence briefings, calling the daily updates unnecessary. He's delegating that task to Vice President-elect Mike Pence instead. Scott Horsley, NPR News, the White House. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"December 12, 2016",Trump's Potential Secretary Of State Rex Tillerson Is A Titan In The Oil Industry," Donald Trump tweeted this evening that he'll be naming his choice for secretary of state tomorrow morning. Several news outlets are reporting that the president-elect will nominate ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson. NPR has not confirmed that. Over the weekend, Donald Trump praised Tillerson but would not confirm the choice. Tillerson is a giant in the business world with ties to Russia. NPR's Jeff Brady has more on the oil and gas executive. JEFF BRADY, BYLINE: Rex Tillerson is a Texas man. He was born in the state and has lived much of his life there. He brags about being an Eagle Scout in this Boy Scouts of America video. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) REX TILLERSON: I have a lot of terrific memories associated with scouting. Probably most of the high points of my growing up years are associated with my scouting activities. BRADY: Tillerson is a University of Texas at Austin graduate where he studied civil engineering before joining Exxon in 1975. He rose through the ranks and became chairman and CEO in 2006. Next March, he reaches ExxonMobil's mandatory retirement age of 65. Even those who are fans of Tillerson's tenure at ExxonMobil are surprised he's being considered for secretary of state. Dennis McCuistion directs the Institute for Excellence in Corporate Governance at the University of Texas at Dallas. McCuistion says Tillerson does have diplomatic experience as head of a multinational oil company. DENNIS MCCUISTION: He's sort of a diplomat for energy. I mean I could see him as a slam-dunk for energy secretary (laughter) as an example, you know, because he is the resident expert. BRADY: McCuistion says no matter how skilled a diplomat Tillerson might be, there are appearances to consider. For example, the oil executive has had extensive dealings with Russian President Vladimir Putin. A quick Internet search, and you'll find plenty of pictures of the two shaking hands and laughing together. ExxonMobil has business dealings in Russia worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Journalist Steve Coll wrote a book about ExxonMobil. He told Michel Martin on WEEKEND ALL THINGS CONSIDERED that Tillerson's business career raises big questions. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) STEVE COLL: He spent all of his life negotiating on behalf of Exxon's interests, which are not always the same as the interests of the United States and the countries where he's worked. So it would be a very unusual transition to the State Department. BRADY: Climate change will be a big issue for the next secretary of state. Some environmental activists say Tillerson is no friend to the planet. They point to legal battles over how much Exxon knew about climate change in the past even as the company downplayed the threat publicly. Speaking at a Council of Foreign Relations event in 2012, Tillerson said he thinks the effects of climate change are manageable. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TILLERSON: It's an engineering problem, and it has engineering solutions. And so I don't - the fear factor that people want to throw out there to say we just have to stop this, I do not accept. BRADY: That last comment was aimed at those environmental activists who argued the world should stop using fossil fuels as soon as possible. Tillerson went on to say that while climate change has to be addressed, he believes poverty is an even more important problem. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TILLERSON: There are still hundreds of millions, billions of people living in abject poverty around the world. They need electricity. They need electricity they can count on, that they can afford. They need fuel to cook their food on that's not animal dung. BRADY: If President-elect Trump nominates Tillerson for secretary of state, he's likely to face a grilling during confirmation hearings. Already a few GOP senators have expressed serious concerns.

npr,"December 12, 2016",Sen. McCain Calls For Congress To Take Closer Look At Russian Hacking," AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  Today, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell voiced support for the intelligence agencies and backed a bipartisan congressional investigation. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MITCH MCCONNELL: Obviously any foreign breach of our cyber security measures is disturbing, and I strongly condemn any such efforts. CORNISH: Senator John McCain, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, was among those pushing for the investigation. Earlier today, he told NPR's Steve Inskeep why he thinks it's important. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) JOHN MCCAIN: I do not know yet that there was any intention on the part of the Russians to affect our election. I do know, and we all know that they were able to obtain information, particularly amongst the Democrat operatives, which were bound to be not helpful to the Clinton election campaign. The reason why we need some hearings and we need some investigation is to determine whether there was an intent to affect the free and fair election in the United States upon which our democracy depends. STEVE INSKEEP, BYLINE: Because you've seen the classified evidence, can you say that there is any doubt that Russia was behind that hack and other activities directed at the United States? MCCAIN: I have not seen classified information that says that. I have seen plenty of unclassified information, including a New York Times article recently which has not been refuted by the administration or the intelligence services. I don't think there's any doubt about that, that it was Russian. And it could have been others as well. But whether it was intended or did have an effect on the election is something that we have to have hearings on. And I'm happy to note that Senator Schumer and I and other senators have committed to acting in a bipartisan fashion. This is too important for us to let it break up into a partisan issue. INSKEEP: We're told that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has now approved the idea of an investigation of this and said Russia is not our friend. Do you and Senator McConnell actually agree on what should be investigated and how it should be investigated? MCCAIN: Yes, this issue specifically but the whole issue of cyber and the attacks and the capabilities and the betrayal of certain industrial as well as military information. This issue of the campaign and their interference there is only a small part of our whole issue regarding cyber and our capabilities or lack of. And the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff testified before the Armed Services Committee that we have an advantage over any possible adversary in every aspect of possible conflict except one - guess what? - cyber. And so we've got to really go to work on it. The first thing we need to do is develop a policy about cyber-attacks and a strategy, which this administration has refused to do. CORNISH: That's Senator John McCain in an interview with NPR's Steve Inskeep - more of that interview tomorrow on MORNING EDITION, including McCain's view on the incoming administration and its relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

npr,"December 12, 2016",Is Hillary Clinton Trying To Question The Legitimacy Of Donald Trump Winning?," Amid news of possible Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election, a top Hillary Clinton adviser is publicly casting support for a push by some members of the Electoral College to receive an intelligence briefing ahead of their formal vote next week. ""The bipartisan electors' letter raises very grave issues involving our national security,"" Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta said in statement Monday. ""Electors have a solemn responsibility under the Constitution and we support their efforts to have their questions addressed."" It's the losing Democratic nominee's most public show of support yet for efforts to question the legitimacy of election results that gave Donald Trump the presidency. And it follows news over the weekend that the CIA has concluded that Russia intervened in the election to help the Republican win. The letter comes from 10 mostly Democratic electors, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's daughter Christine and New Hampshire Rep.-elect Carol Shea-Porter. Only one signatory is a Republican, Texan Chris Suprun, who has already said he is refusing to vote for Trump despite his state's results. The electors point to the recent news about Russian involvement and argue that it's their role to best discharge their duties to ""prevent a 'desire in foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our councils,'"" as Alexander Hamilton outlined in The Federalist Papers #68. Trump is challenging one of the Colorado electors, who signed the letter, in court. He's claiming that if the court overturns a state law binding electors to the statewide winner, it would undermine his election. Though Colorado did vote for Clinton, some electors are hoping it could be used to overturn other state laws where Trump did win. In his statement of support for the electors' push, Podesta also claims that despite the Clinton's campaign's ""protestations, this matter did not receive the attention it deserved by the media in the campaign,"" even though the issue was discussed many times by both candidates and reporters. ""We now know that the CIA has determined Russia's interference in our elections was for the purpose of electing Donald Trump. This should distress every American,"" Podesta continued. ""Never before in the history of our Republic have we seen such an effort to undermine the bedrock of our democracy. This is not a partisan issue and we are glad to see bipartisan support in the Congress for an investigation into Russia's role. We believe that the Administration owes it to the American people to explain what it knows regarding the extent and manner of Russia's interference and this be done as soon as possible. To that end, we also support the request from members of the Senate Intelligence Committee to declassify information around Russia's roles in the election and to make this data available to the public."" Clinton's campaign also supported recount efforts in key Midwest states, like Wisconsin and Michigan, initiated by Green Party nominee Jill Stein, though the Democrats were skeptical they would alter the results. Trump and his aides have pushed back against reports of any Russian interference in last month's election, and the president-elect himself cast doubt on the accuracy of the CIA's intelligence. Former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton, reportedly under consideration for Trump's deputy secretary of state, questioned whether the reports were a ""false flag"" perpetrated by the Obama administration. But GOP congressional leaders are supporting an investigation into whether Russia did interfere. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said he has the ""highest confidence"" in U.S. intelligence agencies. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., also said in a statement that Congress ""must condemn and push back forcefully against any state-sponsored cyberattacks on our democratic process."" Democratic congressional leaders have been far more direct in their criticism and accusations. Retiring Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., blamed FBI Director James Comey's letter in the final weeks of the campaign for reigniting controversy around Clinton's private email server and costing her the election. And yet, Reid noted, Comey did not release more information about possible Russian involvement in the election. ""It's obvious he was a partisan in all this,"" Reid told CNN about Comey. ""There's information out there. He had it, I'm confident. And he ignored it."" NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor ",http://www.npr.org/505286051
npr,"December 12, 2016",Why FBI And CIA Could Differ About Motive For Russian Election Hacks," At the CIA and the FBI, conversations about Russian hacks before the U.S. presidential election are moving into quiet spaces or stopping altogether, three sources told NPR. The agencies are steeling themselves for a congressional investigation that could become one of the most sensitive and politicized in years. But current and former officials in the national security arena said there are a number of reasons the CIA's conclusions could differ, at least for now, from those at the FBI. Among them: FBI agents are trained to develop evidence in cases that will be presented to grand juries and courts, where the burden of proof is higher than a typical intelligence assessment. For instance, the Justice Department took years to name and indict five Chinese military members with hacking into U.S. systems even though intelligence agencies had long before concluded they were responsible for targeting American nuclear and energy interests. Likewise, since the Sept. 11 attacks, the American government has detained a number of ""forever prisoners"" at the military prison at Guantanamo Bay without providing public evidence to try them in civilian or military courts. Authorities said some of the evidence against those men was obtained through brutal interrogations or sensitive foreign sources they do not wish to disclose in the course of a judicial proceeding. Another possibility for the apparent difference in views on the Russian hacks is that the CIA or another intelligence agency has obtained information tying Russian actors to the hacking and the motivations for it through sensitive sources and methods the agency does not want to share widely, even with its U.S. partners. One of the sources said the CIA conclusion that the Russians meddled in the election with the intent of electing Donald Trump was ""hardened"" by members of Congress who leaked and promoted it that way. This source said the FBI is operating on the theory that there could be mixed motives, ""a hedging of bets"" so to speak by the Russians, who like everyone else had no expectation that Trump would actually win. A former U.S. intelligence official said in his experience it's unusual for there to be a fundamental difference in views between agencies by the time a congressional briefing happens, especially on an issue as important as election-year meddling by a foreign power. The official said it's plausible that members of Congress are shading the private briefings in a way to maximize their party's political gain. ""That's the way Congress works,"" he said, ""it tends to gloss over some of the nuance and substance."" Still, he added, he's not convinced this difference can be attributed to the standards by which the FBI and the CIA go about their work, because this matter involves pure analysis of intelligence, where both agencies use the same standards to make judgments. Whether or not Russian interests attempted to tip the scale in the presidential race, former CIA Acting Director Michael Morell called the hacks ""the political equivalent of 9/11."" In an interview with The Cipher Brief, Morell said he feared a response to the hacking could ""fall through the cracks"" of the White House transition, emboldening Vladimir Putin.

npr,"December 12, 2016",The Russian Hacking Controversy: What We Do And Don't Know," Washington felt like a hall of mirrors on Monday. The CIA has concluded that Russia interfered in the U.S. presidential election to help Donald Trump win. But Trump says he doesn't believe that. And the FBI doesn't think there's enough evidence. The U.S. intelligence community had warned about the Russian meddling during the campaign. What's new is that the CIA says it is confident the Russians were acting with a specific goal in mind — to help Trump win. The entire country is now enmeshed in a story that seems to perfectly correspond with the state of politics and the national mood: tense, paranoid, zero-sum and subjective. It's a narrative with too few solid facts to be definitive but just enough that anyone can feel justified in drawing his or her preferred conclusions. Here's a look at what's known so far about the election-hacking story — and what isn't. 1. The U.S. government says Russia meddled in the presidential election  The story first exploded in July, when the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks published a tranche of emails connected to the leadership of the Democratic National Committee. The messages revealed the gritty inner workings of the party elite and showed its preference for Hillary Clinton over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Sanders supporters were outraged; the embarrassment prompted the resignation of DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Later, WikiLeaks released emails from Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta, which depicted her and the campaign's ties to powerful bankers, internal jokes about the Benghazi investigation and other such exchanges. Combined with parallel stories about the FBI's investigation into the private email server that Clinton used at the State Department, the image was of an aloof influence broker who played by her own rules — an impression Clinton never shook. But the internal emails released by WikiLeaks, a site called ""DCLeaks"" and others were not ""leaks"" in the traditional sense — information knowingly given to reporters by an insider. They were stolen by hackers working for Russian intelligence agencies, the U.S. intelligence community concluded. After government officials had said so anonymously in press reports, the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence affirmed it openly, on the record. That followed an online forensics report by the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, which documented in June the evidence that connected the DNC compromise with Russia's domestic intelligence service, the FSB, and its military intelligence service, the GRU. 2. The U.S. intelligence community told the presidential candidates and Congress about the cybermischief during the campaign Trump and Clinton began receiving intelligence briefings after their respective party conventions, in keeping with a long tradition of preparing potential future presidents for what they could face in office. Intelligence officials told the candidates and their campaigns about the evidence for the Russian hacking then, and later during one of the presidential debates Clinton hammered Trump over what she called the support by Russia. Trump, then as now, said he didn't know whether the Russians were trying to help him, or that he didn't believe they were, and that no one could truly know what was happening in cyberspace. ""Maybe there is no hacking,"" he said at the time. Since then, he has asked on Twitter why the hacking story didn't come up before Election Day. In fact, the hacking story came up more than a dozen times during the campaign. On Fox News Sunday, he blamed what he called the sour grapes of Democrats who are still bitter about Clinton's loss. But Trump also told Fox News host Chris Wallace he'd be open to the investigation that Obama has ordered and that members of Congress also say they'll conduct into the Russian meddling. ""President Obama's been terrific,"" Trump said. ""I don't want anyone hacking us. And I'm not only talking about countries. I'm talking about anyone, period. But if you're going to do that, I think you should not just say Russia, you should say other countries also, and maybe other individuals. 3. Russia did more during the election season than release emails  Commentators linked to the Kremlin talked openly about why they supported Trump and why they believed him to be a better candidate for Russia and the world. Russia's state media hailed Trump's election and praised the notion that he might nominate Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson, who has extensive ties in Russia, as secretary of state. The Kremlin also underwrites a team of so-called trolls to post on Twitter and elsewhere on social media. Putin and Trump also praised each other. But Russian diplomats also reached out to Trump's camp behind the scenes, and members of Trump campaign team also had their own previous contacts with Russia. All along, however, Trump disclaimed that he could be swayed by potential business contacts there and noted he's never met Putin. ""I don't know Putin,"" he said. And Trump cast his desire for a better relationship with Moscow as smart diplomacy that would help both sides, especially in the fight against the Islamic State in Syria. Obama had tried for months to conclude a deal with Russia to join forces in Syria, one that hasn't come together. And Russia has continued to help Syrian President Bashar Assad crush anti-government forces in their last major holdout of Aleppo. 4. We don't know precisely why U.S. intelligence believes what it does or why some agencies disagree The intelligence community is united by law under the central leadership of Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, but it is not a monolith. Each agency has its own viewpoint and culture.

 Director of the National Intelligence James Clapper speaks on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., in February. The CIA, charged since World War II with spying overseas and conducting clandestine operations, runs human agents in foreign capitals and assembles what intelligence officers call the ""mosaic"" of information they get to form a whole picture. The FBI, as a law enforcement arm of the Justice Department, got its start building legal cases against major criminals. That could be why the two agencies disagree about the latest nuance of the Russia story: whether it's possible to prove that Putin or other Russian leaders interfered in the election to help Trump. It's a question of intent. Did Moscow simply want to sow chaos in the U.S., or did it want to bring about the specific result the election yielded? The CIA believes the case is there; the FBI does not. The nation's largest intelligence service, however, appears to be in the CIA's camp. Adm. Mike Rogers, director of the National Security Agency, said on Nov. 15 that he believes the Russians knew what they were doing. ""There shouldn't be any doubt in anybody's mind,"" Rogers said at The Wall Street Journal's CEO Council. ""This was not something that was done casually. This was not something that was done by chance. This was not a target that was selected purely arbitrarily. This was a conscious effort by a nation state to attempt to achieve a specific effect."" Much of the evidence remains secret. As the story grows, pressure is increasing on the Obama administration and Congress to release more. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Monday he is confident in the CIA and that the Senate Intelligence Committee and Senate Armed Services Committees were looking into the matter. 5. We don't know whether the Russians also compromised Republicans — and whether they're holding on to what they took as leverage House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul said in September that the Republican National Committee also was hacked during the campaign. Then top RNC officials said that wasn't so. McCaul released a statement explaining that he had ""misspoken."" On Friday, The New York Times reported that U.S. intelligence officials have briefed Congress that Russia in fact did steal information from the RNC. This may be an issue of semantics — whether individual Republicans' emails were compromised or whether hackers may have breached the networks of the RNC. Given the conflicting public statements and the lack of information from the government, this could set up a whole new thread to the story — is the Kremlin holding what campaign operatives would call an ""oppo file"" on Trump or other Republicans? As I said would be the case six months ago. Hack both, help Trump, keep leverage. https://t.co/XJlXUiNJdx The Russian chess master Garry Kasparov, who has gone on to become an outspoken critic of Putin, suggests that Moscow wants weapons it can use against the Trump administration if necessary.

npr,"December 12, 2016","Contrary To Trump's Tweet, Russian Hacking Came Up Before Election (A Lot)"," On July 27, Donald Trump created one of the most surreal moments of the presidential campaign, when he encouraged Russians to hack his opponent's email. ""Russia, if you're listening, I hope you'll be able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,"" Trump said, speaking about Hillary Clinton's deleted emails from her private email account from her time as secretary of state. ""I think you'll probably be rewarded mightily by our press."" So it was a bit of a surprise when on Monday morning, he implied in a tweet that hacking hadn't been a major topic during the election: Unless you catch ""hackers"" in the act, it is very hard to determine who was doing the hacking. Why wasn't this brought up before election? The tweet fits a pattern that Trump has employed before, using Twitter to spread misinformation that fits a narrative he wants to spin. Last month, he insisted that he, in fact, won the popular vote, but that ""millions"" of people voted illegally and handed that win to Hillary Clinton. Likewise, this tweet plays into a story that the hacks are only in the news now because Democrats want to blame the Russians for their loss in November. So, to be clear: Many people (including Trump himself) did bring it up. The topic came up in general-election debates, and both he and his opponent addressed it in their answers. Throughout the campaign, there were suspicions and investigations into the possibility that Russians were behind not only a hack of the Democratic National Committee — the one Trump referenced in the above quote — but also a hack of Clinton adviser John Podesta's emails and state voting registration systems. And while it's true that Trump often shrugged off any indications of hacking, it most definitely was addressed often during the campaign. What's different about the newest CIA assessment is that it concludes the Russians were trying to sway the election in Trump's favor. During the election, intelligence agencies connected Russia to the hacks, but didn't go as far as saying they were intentionally trying to help Trump. Here are 12 more of the many examples out there: 1. Reports of the DNC's early suspicions ""Nearly two months earlier, in April, the Democrats had noticed that something was wrong in their networks. Then, in early May, the DNC called in CrowdStrike, a security firm that specializes in countering advanced network threats. After deploying their tools on the DNC's machines, and after about two hours of work, CrowdStrike found 'two sophisticated adversaries' on the Committee's network. The two groups were well-known in the security industry as 'APT 28' and 'APT 29.' APT stands for Advanced Persistent Threat—usually jargon for spies. CrowdStrike linked both groups to 'the Russian government's powerful and highly capable intelligence services.' "" — Motherboard, July 25, 2016 2. Intelligence agencies report to President Obama ""American intelligence agencies have told the White House they now have 'high confidence' that the Russian government was behind the theft of emails and documents from the Democratic National Committee, according to federal officials who have been briefed on the evidence."" — New York Times, July 26, 2016 3. Intel officials gain confidence ""One official tells NBC News that the attacks have been attributed to Russian intelligence agencies.

Trump questions Russia's involvement ""As far as the cyber, I agree to parts of what Secretary Clinton said. We should be better than anybody else, and perhaps we're not. I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC. She's saying Russia, Russia, Russia, but I don't — maybe it was. I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK? You don't know who broke in to DNC."" — Donald Trump (presidential debate, transcript via CNN), Sept. 26, 2016 5. State voting registration systems hacked ""Nearly half of the states in the U.S. have recently had their voter registration systems targeted by foreign hackers, and four of those systems have successfully been breached, sources tell ABC News. ""That amount of targeting and actual infiltration into state election-related systems is significantly larger than the U.S. government has been willing to acknowledge.

In first general election debate, Clinton takes aim at Russia ""But increasingly, we are seeing cyber attacks coming from states, organs of states. The most recent and troubling of these has been Russia. There's no doubt now that Russia has used cyber attacks against all kinds of organizations in our country, and I am deeply concerned about this. I know Donald's very praiseworthy of Vladimir Putin, but Putin is playing a really ... tough, long game here. And one of the things he's done is to let loose cyber attackers to hack into government files, to hack into personal files, hack into the Democratic National Committee."" — Hillary Clinton (presidential debate, transcript via CNN), Sept. 26, 2016 7. Intelligence agencies make statement on Russia's involvement ""The denunciation, made by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Department of Homeland Security, came as pressure was growing from within the administration and some lawmakers to publicly name Moscow and hold it accountable for actions apparently aimed at sowing discord around the election. "" 'The U.S. Intelligence Community is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations,' said a joint statement from the two agencies.

npr,"December 12, 2016","McConnell, Differing With Trump, Says He Has 'Highest Confidence' In Intel Agencies"," Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky heads to his office from the Senate floor last month. Donald Trump may have run into the first example of how the equal branches of government work — and he's not even president yet. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, the man who controls the agenda in the upper chamber, differed with Trump in a Monday morning press conference, saying he believes Russian involvement in the U.S. election needs to be investigated. He added, ""I have the highest confidence in the intelligence community, and especially the Central Intelligence Agency."" President-elect Trump has dismissed a CIA report that Russians not only were responsible for hacking during the election but also were trying to sway the electorate with those releases to install Trump as president. In a remarkable two-sentence statement Friday, the Trump transition team undercut U.S. intelligence, harking back to Iraq — without addressing the merits of the evidence: ""These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. The election ended a long time ago in one of the biggest Electoral College victories in history. It's now time to move on and 'Make America Great Again.' "" The Democratic National Committee was hacked during the election, as was Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. Those emails were then posted to WikiLeaks. Trump was told by intelligence briefers before the election that Russian actors were responsible. Trump repeatedly refused to accept that. And he now says he does not and will not accept the traditionally daily intelligence briefings, calling them ""repetitive."" He said Vice President-elect Mike Pence will take the briefing instead. McConnell seemed to condemn the leak of the CIA assessment, however. He noted that the director of national intelligence released a statement before the election saying that the Russian government directed recent email compromises in the U.S. political system. He noted that statement was the unclassified assessment that was appropriate for public disclosure. ""Anything else is irresponsible, likely illegal, and potentially for partisan gain,"" McConnell said, adding, ""This simply cannot be a partisan issue."" He continued, noting that the Senate Intelligence Committee ""is more than capable of conducting a complete review of this matter."" McConnell expressed the expectation that when the Obama administration completes its review, the director of National Intelligence will provide ""additional information released to the public in a responsible manner."" He also endorsed Arizona Sen. John McCain's desire to investigate vulnerabilities to cyberattacks in the Senate Armed Services Committee. ""The reason we need some hearings and investigation,"" McConnell said, ""is to determine whether there was an intent to affect the free and fair elections of the United States upon which our democracy depends."" McCain spoke to NPR Monday afternoon. ""I don't know yet that there was any intention on the part of the Russians to affect our election,"" McCain told NPR's Steve Inskeep. ""I do know and we all know that they were able to obtain information, particularly amongst the Democrat operatives, which were bound to be not helpful to the Clinton election campaign."" House Speaker Paul Ryan weighed in with a statement on Monday afternoon. ""We must condemn and push back forcefully against any state-sponsored cyberattacks on our democratic process,"" Ryan said. He also expressed confidence in the House Intelligence Committee to continue its work on cyberthreats. That committee is led by California Rep. Devin Nunes, a strong Trump backer who has also expressed alarm about Russian hacking. Ryan also tried to tamp down partisan interpretations of cyberattacks. ""As we work to protect our democracy from foreign influence, we should not cast doubt on the clear and decisive outcome of this election,"" his statement read. At McConnell's news conference, he was also asked about Trump's Cabinet picks and whether he thinks they will pass muster with the senators. The Senate majority leader said he thinks they are mostly very well-qualified and will pass, but he would not comment specifically on the possible nomination of Exxon-Mobil Chairman and CEO Rex Tillerson as secretary of state. McConnell noted only that he had given his view on Russia. ""Let me speak for myself: The Russians are not our friends,"" McConnell said. Tillerson was awarded the Russian ""Order of Friendship"" in 2013 by Russian President Vladimir Putin. NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor ",http://www.npr.org/505260062
npr,"December 12, 2016",Donald Trump: Strong Leader Or Dangerous Authoritarian?," Even before he is sworn in, Donald Trump is putting his own stamp on the role of chief executive. That has some people rejoicing — and others worried about where he's going to take the country. Here is why some of Trump's critics say the president-elect could be a threat to democratic institutions and why others say those fears are overblown. Trump is shaping up to be more than just an activist president. With one tweet, he drives down the stock price of a major American company. With another, he unleashes a flood of death threats against a local labor leader who displeased him. Evan McMullin, a former Republican House staffer and CIA operative who ran as an independent for president against Trump, points to Trump's intervention with the Carrier company. Trump's involvement led to Carrier agreeing to keep 750 jobs in the U.S. instead of moving them to Mexico. McMullin charged that the Carrier deal showed that Trump has authoritarian instincts. ""The most fundamental part of authoritarianism is this idea that what the authoritarian believes should go,"" McMullin told NPR. ""They are the only authority. It's the president making decisions about particular companies rather than working within the system to create laws that affect companies in the context of the rule of law."" But others, even critics of Trump, say the Carrier deal was not necessarily a sign of a populist authoritarian in the making — it was merely bad economic policy. Wall Street Journal columnist Bret Stephens, a Trump critic, said the president-elect is giving new meaning to the bully part of the bully pulpit. ""It just sets a dangerous precedent that a president can take a private company by the throat,"" Stephens said. ""It's not what you'd expect from a guy who supposedly believes in the power that supports free markets."" And, say others, it was a pretty lousy deal — since Carrier has announced it plans to automate the plant and lay off even more workers. But Trump's supporters say his intervention with Carrier shows Trump is a strong leader — doing exactly what he promised to do during the campaign. Conservative talk-show host Laura Ingraham, who is in contention for White House press secretary, said what Trump did, when he reminded Carrier's parent company about its defense contracts with the federal government and got the company to accept the package of incentives the state of Indiana was already offering, was well within the bounds of executive action. ""Giving companies incentives to stay in states, as you see governors do all the time,"" Ingraham said, ""what's wrong with that? What's wrong with doing things that actually help regular, working-class Americans and that are popular?"" But the debate about Trump and democracy doesn't stop there. His critics say they can find no instance where Trump spoke in defense of democratic institutions or values. During the campaign he questioned the ability of a U.S.-born judge with Mexican parents to preside fairly over a lawsuit against him. Trump was suggesting that being an American has more to do with ethnic heritage than shared values. Over the weekend, Trump cast doubt on U.S. intelligence and said he doesn't plan to take daily intelligence briefings. He has repeatedly sided with Russia, casting doubt that Russians hacked Democratic National Committee emails and the emails of Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta — and colluded to release them via WikiLeaks. The CIA concluded Russia did so in an effort to help install Trump as the next U.S. president. Trump dismisses any evidence of that. President Obama has launched a ""full review"" of international meddling related to U.S. elections going back to the 2008 election, when China was found to have hacked both the Obama and McCain campaigns. When it comes to freedom of speech, Trump is famous for his attacks on the media. Those are standard for political candidates, but Trump went even further, threatening to alter libel laws so journalists could be ""sued like they've never been sued before."" During the campaign, Trump also promised to throw Hillary Clinton in jail. Even after he won, his critics say his magnanimous offer to refrain from prosecuting her showed a lack of understanding of the U.S. democratic system, under which presidents don't get to decide by themselves whom to prosecute, let alone throw in jail. Then there's the ongoing debate about Trump's constant stream of statements that have no basis in fact. Coupled with the torrent of fake news stories (which Trump has repeated), these falsehoods, Trump's critics say, could undermine liberal democracy. Whether stating with zero proof that millions of noncitizens voted illegally, claiming falsely that climate change is a hoax, questioning baselessly (for years) whether Obama was born in the United States, stating that he ""heard"" the unemployment rate might really be 42 percent or that everything people hear from the ""dishonest media"" is a lie, Trump's messages are designed to sow confusion, McMullin said. After all, if citizens can't believe anything they hear, then the easiest path is to just trust the leader. And, Trump has said, ""I alone"" can fix the country's problems. To McMullin, this is a hallmark of authoritarians. He points to Trump's false claim that millions of illegal votes prevented him from winning a popular-vote majority, for example. ""It serves to undermine our democratic institutions,"" McMullin said. ""If those institutions are weakened, if we have less faith, for example, in elections, that strengthens the hand of the authoritarian."" The response of Trump's supporters to that critique hasn't been what you'd expect. Instead of insisting that Trump is telling the truth, Trump's surrogates, like his former campaign Manager Corey Lewandowski, said falsehoods are just part of Trump's leadership style. ""This is the problem with the media,"" Lewandowski said at a recent Harvard University forum. ""You guys took everything Donald Trump said so literally. And the problem with that is the American people didn't. They understood that sometimes when you have a conversation with people, you're going to say something, and maybe you don't have all the facts to back that up, but that's how the American people live."" Lewandowski seems to be arguing that since the average American might not know what he's talking about, why should Trump? Other Trump surrogates, like Scottie Nell Hughes, openly embrace Trump's role as the first president operating in a post-factual world. ""There's no such thing, unfortunately, anymore of facts,"" Hughes said recently on The Diane Rehm Show. ""And so Mr. Trump's tweets, amongst a certain crowd, a large — a large part of the population, are truth."" The argument that Trump's repeated prevarications pose a threat to democratic institutions, and to American democracy itself, is rejected by former George W. Bush strategist Karl Rove. He dismissed it as nothing more than left-wing hyperventilation. ""This is far-fetched, starting with the authoritarianism,"" Rove told NPR. ""Yes, there are Republicans concerned that he rambunctiously doesn't understand the restraints on the executive, that he doesn't understand the prerogatives under Article 1 that Congress enjoys — yeah. But the process is going to teach him those constraints — and reality is going to teach him those constraints."" Former Clinton White House aide Bill Galston agrees. He points to the checks and balances American founders designed to restrain any president who tries to chip away at rule of law, individual rights, a free press or an independent judiciary. ""I think the next few years will be a kind of stress test for the liberal, democratic constitutional institutions that we have built with such pain and such struggle over the last two-and-a-quarter centuries,"" Galston said. ""I am cautiously optimistic that our institutions will pass that test, but they will be tested."" This is what the conversation is like at the dawn of the age of Trump, where it's not yet clear what a Trump presidency will mean — for the economy, foreign policy or democratic institutions.

npr,"December 12, 2016",Trump Expected To Name His Pick For Secretary Of State Soon," RICHARD HAASS: Good morning, David. GREENE: So I know this is not over till it's over. Tillerson has yet to be actually nominated. But how would you see him in the role of secretary of state? HAASS: Well, look, any secretary of state to be effective first and foremost needs to be close to the president. He also needs to be knowledgeable about the - all the issues and has to be comfortable and knowledgeable about how foreign policy is made - how the sausage is made. So the biggest variable would be Mr. Tillerson's relationship with the president, which is something essentially Mr. Trump controls. The other question's, you know, he's an outsider who knows a lot about the world. GREENE: Yeah. HAASS: There's some difference between knowing about the world and knowing about foreign policy. And he'd obviously need to surround himself with people who had experience on the ground inside the department and around the interagency process. GREENE: A lot of the worry - criticism that we've heard so far is that he has done business with countries like Russia, I mean, oil and gas deals over the years. And, I mean, the interests of his company and the interests of the United States when dealing with Russia - not always identical, right? I mean, how would Tillerson deal with that? HAASS: Well, exactly. And you're already seeing certain Republicans like Lindsey Graham and John McCain and others raise those questions. GREENE: Yeah. HAASS: Obviously it would be central to any confirmation if it gets to that point. And that's just the sort of thing he would have to deal with. He would have to say, here's why I did what I did at the time. Here's how I'm going to separate myself from it now. Here's how I view Russia and how I would approach policy toward Russia. So this is now probably the biggest single set of questions he would have to tackle. And I think the real question is whether this question is large enough to get in his way - in the way first of his nomination and if the nomination goes ahead, about whether it goes - gets in the way of his confirmation. GREENE: So I guess we're getting a preview of what some of the tough questions might be in a confirmation process. Let me ask you this question in a different way. I mean, is there an argument that Tillerson would really be fulfilling Donald Trump's promise to his supporters to shake things up and that he could be successful? I mean, a tough negotiator. He's been in the business world. He's been in the trenches making high-stakes deals with foreign governments. I mean, you know, could this be a different kind of secretary of state that really could get a lot of things done? HAASS: Well, he would be somewhat different. You know, he's not a lawyer, which a lot of secretaries of states - and he's not someone who comes from the inside one way or another who's an experienced diplomat. And quite honestly, that's always the plus and minus of an outsider. Outsiders can come in and bring creativity and really take. And outsiders can come in, say like Paul O'Neill who became the secretary of the Treasury and couldn't translate what he did in the private sector into the public sector. So these are one-offs and it's just hard to generalize. GREENE: Early in the campaign you met with Donald Trump to talk foreign policy. There was even some speculation that you were on the list of possible nominees for secretary of state. Were you ever, I mean, did the transition team ever talk to you about the job? HAASS: I've talked to the transition team and to Mr. Trump recently about foreign policy, but no one has spoken to me about the job of secretary of state, no. GREENE: Would you want that job? HAASS: That's a complicated question. GREENE: (Laughter). HAASS: I think you've always got to - look, you know, I think it's important to serve your country if you're given the chance. I think though what I said before about what it takes to be a successful secretary of state, I think you not only do need a close relationship with the president but there's got to be fundamental alignment between you and the president on some of the most central issues. So that's the kind of conversation any candidate would need to have with any president to make sure that this combination works. Because in my career I've seen people who have thrived in that job, say a Jim Baker for George Bush the father. And without mentioning names I've seen people who haven't thrived in that job, different secretaries and different presidents. GREENE: Just about 20 seconds left. I mean, if you don't fundamentally align with Donald Trump, what is the one place where we would see that most starkly? HAASS: Well, just recently, for example, I've had real differences with him about China policy. I do believe that the one-China policy serves American interests well. I also believe that the post-World War II support of international trade agreements on balance has served this country well both economically and strategically. GREENE: OK. Richard Haass is president of the Council on Foreign Relations, also a former adviser to Secretary of State Colin Powell. Thanks so much for joining us this morning.

npr,"December 12, 2016",Politics In The News," The revelation over the weekend that the CIA believes Russia interfered in the election to help sway the vote to Donald Trump isn't going over well with one Donald Trump. Here's the here's the president-elect speaking to Fox News yesterday. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""FOX NEWS SUNDAY WITH CHRIS WALLACE"") DONALD TRUMP: I think it's ridiculous. I think it's just another excuse. I don't believe it. I don't know why. And I think it's just - you know, they talked about all sorts of things. Every week, it's another excuse. We had a massive landslide victory, as you know. MARTIN: Trump's team also put out a statement slamming the CIA for its intelligence failures in Iraq a decade ago. At the same time, Democrats and plenty of Republicans in Congress are urging a deeper look into Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election. NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson is on the line now with more. Good morning, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Rachel. MARTIN: This isn't some liberal advocacy organization making this claim about Russia's interference. It's the CIA. LIASSON: It's the CIA, and it sounds like Trump doesn't really want to accept anything that undermines his win, which was stunning and even decisive, but not, as he just said, a landslide Electoral College victory. You know, he got 306 electoral votes. That actually ranks 46th out of 58 Electoral College victories. But yesterday, he even said that this - these reports, or a consensus view of Russian hacking, were just another excuse by Democrats to minimize his win. But he is doing more than just saying - rejecting the intelligence community's conclusion that Russia interfered in the election not just to undermine confidence in American democracy but to actually help him. He is also rejecting the bottom line that Russia hacked period. I mean, he's been adamant about this for months. He said we don't know who hacked. It could have been some guy in New Jersey. Why is he rejecting that? We really don't know except that we do know that he has a much more positive view of Russia than the foreign policy consensus, which is alarmed at Russian aggression around the world. MARTIN: There was a bipartisan statement from the Hill yesterday saying Congress needs to look into this further. So how's that going to unfold? LIASSON: There was a bipartisan statement yesterday. Four senators said Russia's cyberattacks should alarm every American and that Congress should look into this without it becoming a partisan issue. Yesterday, John McCain, one of those senators, was on ""Face The Nation."" He said he doesn't know what to make of Trump's comments because he said it's clear the Russians did interfere and, quote, ""facts are stubborn things."" Also in the House, Mike McCaul, who's the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, also wants an investigation. And the chief of staff of the incoming Trump administration Reince Priebus, said he does support any investigation to protect Americans from foreign interference. So it looks like Trump will have a hard time stopping this if Congress wants to look into it. We also have President Obama who's asked for an inquiry into the cyberattacks to be completed by the time he leaves office, which, of course, is inauguration day for Donald Trump. MARTIN: One of the more remarkable things about Trump's reaction to all this isn't that he's dismissing the conclusions of the CIA, which is in and of itself remarkable. But he is blasting the agency in particular, calling out the intelligence failures that led to the invasion of Iraq, trying to make this kind of personal with the CIA. LIASSON: Well, he - not only did he insult the intelligence community yesterday, he said in a statement - not a tweet - he said that these are the same people who were wrong about weapons of mass destruction. But he also said on FOX yesterday that he doesn't need intelligence briefings every day. He said he's, quote, ""like a smart person"" and doesn't need to hear the same words every day for eight years. They can call me when there's something new. And that raises the question what happens if the intelligence community comes to him with information about Iran or China or North Korea that doesn't fit into his assumptions and worldview? This is a big breach. He hasn't even taken office yet, but already we have this big breach between the president and the American intelligence community. This also raises some questions about what kind of president Trump will be. You know, all during the campaign there were questions that, oh, Trump will change. He'll pivot. There's a candidate Trump and then there'll be a different, more sober, less bombastic President Trump. I think the answer so far is what you see is what you get. He said during the campaign that his brain was his best adviser, and he's shown the same impulsiveness, willingness to insult others and lack of curiosity. None of those traits have changed. MARTIN: Before I let you go, I want to ask you about another name that's been floated for secretary of state. This is Rex Tillerson, ExxonMobil CEO. NPR hasn't confirmed this independently, but reports are saying he's the top of the list now. He's done a lot of business himself with Russia, has a close relationship with Vladimir Putin. Let's listen to what Senator John McCain said about it yesterday on CBS. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""FACE THE NATION"") JOHN MCCAIN: It's a matter of concern to me that he has such a close, personal relationship with Vladimir Putin. And obviously, they've done enormous deals together that that would color his approach to Vladimir Putin and the Russian threat. But that is a matter of concern. We will give him his chance. MARTIN: We should say reports are that Condi Rice and Bob Gates, both old Cold Warriors, have recommended Tillerson. But what do you think this means for his likelihood to get through a vetting process on Capitol Hill? LIASSON: I think there'll be some pushback. It wasn't just John McCain. You know, Marco Rubio, who was the Foreign Relations Committee, tweeted that being a friend of Vladimir is not an attribute I look for in a secretary of state. But I think that he'll be asked some tough questions. He was against the sanctions against Russia for taking over Crimea. ExxonMobil, of course, was hurt by those sanctions. But Trump likes him because he's a dealmaker, and this does fit into Trump's transactional view of diplomacy. MARTIN: NPR's Mara Liasson. Thanks so much, Mara. LIASSON: Thank you.

npr,"December 12, 2016",Members Of Black Lives Matter Gear Up For Trump's Administration," Donald Trump's election has mobilized activists around this country, and that includes members of the Black Lives Matter movement. Some are concerned that the Trump administration will push back against their calls for more police accountability and also in other issues. NPR's Hansi Lo Wang recently checked in with some Black Lives Matter activists. This is part of our project with NPR's national desk looking at how Americans from all walks of life are moving forward from the election. And Hansi joins us on the line. Hey, Hansi. HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE: Hey, David. GREENE: So who exactly have you been talking to? WANG: Well, I talked to two of the women who actually came up with the name Black Lives Matter three years ago, and they've since started the Black Lives Matter network. It's more than 40 chapters in and out of the U.S., and they're calling Donald Trump a, quote, ""white supremacist."" They think his rhetoric has been harmful to communities of color, and it's led to more reports of hate crimes since the election. And one co-founder told me that they don't plan to work with Donald Trump. This is Patrice Kahn Colors. She's based in LA, and here's what she said. PATRISSE KHAN-CULLORS: We're not going to be taking meetings with Donald Trump (laughter). We're not going to be sitting with his attorney general. What we will be doing is protesting. What we will be doing is calling for an end to white nationalism and fascism. WANG: Now, during the campaign, David, Donald Trump called the Black Lives Matter movement a, quote, ""threat."" GREENE: Yeah. WANG: But it's really hard to say exactly what is Black Lives Matter because there is no one Black Lives Matter. They're a decentralized movement. There's no agreement in terms of tactics, strategy or priorities. For example, you know, some groups want to see more alignment with other marginalized groups, while others are committed to prioritizing issues of the black community first. So there's really a range of visions, depending on which activist you're talking to. GREENE: And this is exactly what some people who are involved in protest movements say can be the real problem - if there's no central mission or central organization, right? WANG: Well, the co-founders of the movement that I talked to see decentralization as a strength of the movement. It allows local activists to really run with the ball and focus on local issues. And I spent time with two different groups that have a better understanding of that. The first one was in New Jersey at Rutgers University, and this is a group that, this summer, they've organized a march against a police shooting of a black man in New Jersey. They've protested for a black professor to get tenure on their campus. And they recently held a post-election strategy meeting they let me sit in on it. And, David, we were in a conference room at Rutgers' black cultural center. There are about a handful of mostly students in their early 20s, and there was an intense discussion about what it means now that Trump is president-elect with Republicans still in control of Congress. EMONY JOHNSON: Now that Trump has a majority in everything, I don't know how, if you are not a white American, you are not scared at night. WANG: That was 20 year old Emony Johnson. The meeting was led by Taqwa Brookins. She's 20 and the chairperson of Black Lives Matter Rutgers. And she was especially worried about Trump's nominee for U.S. attorney general, Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions, because he was once denied a federal judge position after lawyers testified that he made racist comments. TAQWA BROOKINS: If the local police departments decide that it's justified when it's really not, who do we go to? We go to the federal government, and we ask that the attorney general opens up an investigation. And so for me, personally, I think it's probably going to be more of an issue going forward simply because he's just not on our side. WANG: The group is trying to do more outreach to the community by inviting older members, like Roseanne Thomas, who's 63. ROSEANNE THOMAS: I brought with me tonight a book which I purchased just for Black Lives Matter. It's ""Organizing For Social Change."" And the chapter that I Xeroxed for everyone is recruiting. WANG: Thomas is a Rutgers alum with a lot of community organizing experience, and she sees Trump's election as an opportunity because it's been so divisive. THOMAS: I feel that the time has now come for all of these different minorities to gather together and to do something. There is a lot of groups who refused to unite with black people in the past. They will all come to you now. WANG: But Thomas says organizing is still key. THOMAS: Going out, knocking on doors, talking to people, pumping palms. You know, it's not all social media. You have to get people interested to get to the social media. We need more people from the community to be involved with the students so that we can maintain continuity of Black Lives Matter Rutgers. WANG: So that's a snapshot from one group that's an official chapter of the Black Lives Matter network. And again, it's important to remember that there are other activist groups using the same label, Black Lives Matter, but they're not necessarily coordinated in their messaging and strategies. I met up with an independent group called Black Lives Matter Greater New York. They recently worked with high school students to organize a march in Manhattan. (SOUNDBITE OF DEMONSTRATION) WALTER NEWSOME: When I say black lives, y'all say matter. Black lives. UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: Matter. NEWSOME: Black lives. UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: Matter. NEWSOME: Word. (CHEERING, APPLAUSE) WANG: This was a protest in honor of black and Latino men and women killed at the hands of police. But the main organizer - his name is Walter Hawk Newsome - he was calling for support not just for more police accountability, but also for protests by Native American groups against the oil pipeline at Standing Rock in North Dakota and for immigrants who may be facing deportation once Trump is in the White House. NEWSOME: We stand, and we say, no more injustices to our native people, no more injustices to immigrants. WANG: But before the election, Newsome organized a campaign calling for African-American voters to not vote. It was supposed to be a protest of both Democrats and Republicans for not prioritizing criminal justice reform, but now his group is focusing on local elections. NEWSOME: We taking over New York City politics. I guarantee you nobody will become mayor of New York City unless Black Lives Matter says so. WANG: So this campaign in New York comes after another independent Black Lives Matter activists in Baltimore, DeRay Mckesson, lost a primary race for mayor. So we may see more Black Lives Matter groups moving beyond street protests next year. And another possible shift is more groups partnering more prominently with other activists based in the immigrant and Muslim communities, for example. GREENE: Hansi, it's safe to say, I mean, it sounds like this is a group that is still very angry, sort of finding its next step, open to different partnerships, as you just said, maybe with immigrant, Muslim communities, but not totally settled on one mission yet. WANG: They're not because it's a very, again, decentralized, disparate group of activists that are under this umbrella called Black Lives Matter. But if you talk to the co-founders of the movement, they're really aiming for a coalition of activists to help drive the Black Lives Matter movement. I talked to Alicia Garza through Skype. She's based in Oakland, and here's what she said. ALICIA GARZA: It has to be a multiracial movement that understands the role that anti-blackness plays in dividing us, in keeping us separate and in making sure that we don't all have the things that we need to survive. WANG: You know, David, Garza told me she sees a potential for a - essentially, a wider Black Lives Matter tent. But how that happens is going to be complicated because different groups may have to compromise on their priorities if they're going to move forward together. GREENE: OK, talking to my colleague, Hansi Lo Wang, about the future of the Black Lives Matter movement under Donald Trump. Hansi, thanks. WANG: You're welcome, David Copyright © 2016 NPR.

npr,"December 12, 2016",Senators Call For Probe Into Claims Russia Interfered In U.S. Election," And we begin this hour with the latest on the CIA, Russia and President-elect Trump. To get you caught up this Monday morning, here is what unfolded over the weekend. Late on Friday, news broke that the CIA believes Russia interfered with the presidential election in order to tip it to Donald Trump. That has led a bipartisan group of senators to call for a sweeping investigation. Donald Trump is dismissing it, saying there is no hard evidence. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""FOX NEWS SUNDAY WITH CHRIS WALLACE"") DONALD TRUMP: They have no idea if it's Russia or China or somebody. It could be somebody sitting in a bed someplace. MARTIN: And that was the president-elect speaking yesterday on Fox News. NPR's Mary Louise Kelly is here in the studio with us to talk more. Good morning, Mary Louise. MARY LOUISE KELLY, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel. MARTIN: Let's start off by having you remind us exactly what it is the CIA is claiming. KELLY: So as often is the case covering the intelligence beat, we do not have access to the actual document that the CIA has briefed on Capitol Hill. It's classified, so we're relying on people who have seen it who can describe the contents of it. But what I am told by a U.S. official who has seen it is that in the last several weeks new information has come to light that has led the CIA to conclude with confidence that Russia intervened to tip the election to Trump. That's what's new. We've been hearing for a while about Russian hacks into political institutions here in the U.S. This is the CIA attributing a motive, saying this was why they were doing it. MARTIN: A partisan intention. KELLY: Exactly. MARTIN: Now, we're also hearing that the FBI isn't quite as confident in this judgment, that maybe there are divisions within the intelligence community. So what is the evidence that the CIA has, what proof that Russia intervened? KELLY: That is the million-dollar question. Again, the assessment's classified. Members of Congress who have been briefed who I've spoken to described the evidence as strong. One of the key points appears to be that the CIA says not just Democratic institutions were hacked, like the DNC - the Democratic National Committee - but the RNC, the Republican National Committee. But those emails and documents weren't leaked. MARTIN: All right. So how are the plans shaping up for an investigation? Because there are several senators now calling for this. KELLY: There are. There are all kinds of investigations shaping up into this. Two big ones that will be unfolding - one that's underway already, that's been ordered by President Obama. That is him ordering his intelligence agencies to look into campaign season cyberintrusions going all the way back - this year but also going back to 2008. He wants that before he leaves office, so they're rushing to complete that in the next few weeks. Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, there are moves to launch their own investigation, as you mentioned. Today, this morning, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell came out and threw his full weight behind the CIA. Let's listen to that. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MITCH MCCONNELL: I have the highest confidence in the intelligence community and especially the Central Intelligence Agencies. The CIA is filled with selfless patriots, many of whom anonymously risk their lives for the American people. KELLY: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell - he also said he supports investigations that other senators are talking about kicking off. And one key point that I think is worth stressing here - you were not hearing anybody speaking out on the Hill saying we should reopen - relitigate the results of the election. What they are saying is let's figure out what happened and try to figure out how it should never happen again. MARTIN: But if you just look at Donald Trump's reaction to all this, he says he doesn't believe Russia interfered, which is a big deal for a president-elect to publicly question a CIA assessment. So what does that mean for this next administration, for this next president and his relationship with his Central Intelligence Agency? KELLY: We are in uncharted waters. Nobody knows what the answer to that is. As I have made calls and spoken to CIA officials - current and past - over the last 72 hours, they describe a deep uneasiness about how this bodes for the future. I mean, the CIA, let's remember, is supposed to be nonpartisan. It is supposed to operate above the political fray - not saying they always succeed but that is the idea. And now they find themselves in the middle of this huge political storm that, as these investigations proceed and as more leaks come out and as more is officially made public, we can only assume it's a storm that's going to get bigger. MARTIN: National security correspondent Mary Louise Kelly, thank you so much. KELLY: You're welcome. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"December 11, 2016",Why People Believe Conspiracy Theories," So we called up Viren Swami, a professor of social psychology at Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge in the United Kingdom. The psychology of conspiracy theories is among his research interests, and I started by asking him if there's a profile of the kind of a person who tends to believe in conspiracy theories. VIREN SWAMI: There are a number of psychological traits that we have found to be associated with belief in conspiracy theories. I would suggest that profiling the conspiracy theorist is going to be quite difficult because, A, there are a range of different conspiracy theories, and B, I think the conspiracy narrative itself is believed by so many people that to come to a profile that fits everyone just wouldn't be possible. MARTIN: How is this different from people who are just, say, bigots - you know, who just adhere to certain fixed beliefs about certain people? SWAMI: I think they can be separate. I think there are some times when they may be inherently linked. But I think they're very different narratives, and they're very different belief systems. I think one of the things about conspiracy theories is - particularly in the United States is that nationally representative surveys suggests that up to about 50 percent of the population believe in at least one conspiracy theory. And there aren't any clear ideological divides. So you find conspiracist ideation among the left wing, among the middle ground, among the right wing. Now, the content of the conspiracy theories might differ. So a common right-wing conspiracy theory would be the Obama birther conspiracy theory, whereas a left-wing conspiracy theory might be this idea that the financial crisis was intentionally caused in order to extend the power of the Federal Reserve. So the content might change, but the prevalence of it doesn't seem to differ whether you're left-wing or right-wing. I think some people who believe in conspiracy theories believe in those ideas because it restores a sense of agency. It gives them a sense of power. It gives them a sense that they can do something about the world. Now, one of the things we find quite consistently is that people who believe in conspiracy theories tend to be alienated, tend to be divorced from mainstream politics. MARTIN: The New York Times in reporting on this recounts a recent poll conducted by Fairleigh Dickinson University that says that 63 percent of registered American voters believe in at least one political conspiracy theory. Now, why might that be, particularly in a country like the United States where people really pride themselves on being optimistic and can-do? Why would that be such a pervasive part of the character of our politics? SWAMI: I think there are going to be lots of different explanations for that. I think one explanation would center on the basis that a huge swathe of the American population feel disaffected, feel alienated. They don't feel like big politics represents them. One of the other things I think - as an outsider looking in at American politics, I think one of the big changes we've seen is the use of a conspiracy narrative as a means of mobilizing people. So Trump and the people around him are using a conspiracy narrative in my view to - not just to kind of have an argument with people but actually to mobilize people, to use it as a way of getting people involved in a campaign. And I think that was one of the big changes for me. I don't think historically it's incredibly rare to see that actually happen. MARTIN: I'm wondering if what your take is on the effect of the Internet on this propensity to believe conspiracy theories. I think that one might assume that access to more information would attenuate this because people can easily find out that what they think is true is not true or that there are countervailing facts. But it doesn't seem to work that way. SWAMI: Human beings have a very natural tendency to take in information that fits their own perspective of the world. And we tend to reject information or reject evidence that we disagree with. And we do that for a very simple reason. We don't like it when we feel wrong. We don't like it when people tell us we're wrong because that damages our psychological well-being. We don't like thinking that our view of the world, our perspective of the world is incorrect. So what tends to happen is that we look for information; we look for evidence that fits what we already know or what we already believe, and we try to avoid information or evidence that we either disagree with or that we know doesn't fit with our perspective. And if someone comes along and says, here's the evidence, your natural tendency's actually to rehearse arguments against that evidence. MARTIN: So what does one do? I mean what does one do because people who are in the information-disseminating business as you are and as we are, frankly, tend to believe that, you know, the facts matter and that this is important and that if you continue to kind of repeat the truth, that that somehow drives out the false narrative. That doesn't seem to be the case, so is there another way we should be thinking about this? SWAMI: I think the first thing I would say is that we need to teach people and teach everyone how to be better critical thinkers, how to use information, how to understand pieces of information and how to look at information and work out whether it's good or bad information. That for me is the first step. But I don't think that's going to be enough. I think if you kind of go along with this idea that conspiracy theories are more likely to emerge when people feel disaffected, when people feel alienated, then the natural outcome of that - the natural answer to what we should do is that we should be promoting greater democratic access. We should allow for everyone to be part of a democratic process in which they have a say, in which they have a voice. And once you start to have that, I think you will start to see the conspiracy theories start to diminish. MARTIN: That's Viren Swami. He's a professor of social psychology at Anglia Ruskin University. That's based in Cambridge in the United Kingdom. Thank you so much for speaking with us. SWAMI: Thank you. Copyright © 2016 NPR.

npr,"December 11, 2016",Outlining Trump's Potential Conflicts Of Interest," MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Now it's time for our regular segment, Words You'll Hear. That's where we take a word or phrase that will be in the news next week and talk about what it means and why it matters. This week, the phrase is conflict of interest. We're already hearing it during the transition to the Trump administration because of the president-elect's wide-ranging business interests. Donald Trump said in an interview on Fox News this morning that he will allow his adult children to manage his businesses. And he doesn't plan to sell his business operations. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: They're not making deals, and they're going to run my company. I have a lot of property and great stuff. They're going to run it. They're going to run it. Hopefully they're going to run it properly. I'm sure they're going to run it properly. But I'm not going to do deals. And I think, you know, I think that's going to be good. MARTIN: This Thursday, President-elect Trump is expected to make an announcement about what he plans to do with his businesses. To find out more about the possible conflicts of interest at issue here, we reached NPR business editor Marilyn Geewax. She is heading up a new NPR initiative looking into Trump's business interests and areas of possible conflict. MARILYN GEEWAX, BYLINE: Well, first of all, let me just say that the Trump Organization is a tough one to follow because it's very private. It's family-owned, and they have stakes in hundreds of companies spread over at least 20 countries. So it's a very strange structure, and it's been in the Trump family since the 1920s. They've never gone public, so there aren't a lot of public records. And Mr. Trump himself has refused to release his tax records, so the most you can do is take educated guesses and look at the scant filings that he has put out there. Experts say that he's probably worth between $3-and-a-half billion and $4 billion. So to understand where that wealth comes from - if you look at his businesses, you can make it a little bit simpler by putting it into three big groupings. There are three things he fundamentally does. One is licensing. That's where he puts his name on lots of different things. That could be anything from a mattress to neckties - just all sorts of things. The second thing is a collection of golf courses and resorts. And there are big names in there like Doral golf course down in south Florida. And the third thing is, he has a big cluster of sort of real estate and retail. Like, if you think about the Trump Tower, it has stores in it. It has restaurants. It has offices. So there's that third grouping. And again, that's just licensing, golf courses, real estate. MARTIN: What's the controlling authority here? Is there - is this a matter of perception, or is this a law that he has to abide by? GEEWAX: Well, it's kind of tricky because all of those businesses that he has - there could be these conflicts of interest where his profits and his job as president might conflict. So who's in charge of that? Well, there are conflict of interest laws, but as luck would have it, they apply to members of the Cabinet but oddly enough not to the president and the vice president. They were written so that they don't apply to the president. But there is something in the Constitution. It's this weird name. It's called the Emoluments Clause. That's an old-timey word. It basically means to profit from holding an office. And the Founding Fathers didn't want presidents taking bribes from foreign governments, so they put this clause in the Constitution. But what's a bribe? It's kind of, well - if somebody's doing business in your hotel in another country, is that a bribe, or is it just they're staying at your hotel? It's a very complicated situation. MARTIN: So again, the question is, why does this matter? Trump voters knew what they were getting. I mean, they voted for him. He campaigned on the idea that because he is a business person he would be less swayed by money in politics. So again, the question is, why is it important to keep tabs on these potential conflicts of interest now? GEEWAX: Here's the thing. The United States is a very rich country, and part of the reason that it's very rich is because that it's been very transparent. It's sort of - when you do business in the United States, it's pretty honest. Like, courts uphold contracts, and there are laws against bribery and that kind of thing. And countries that have good reputations - Germany, the U.K., Canada, the United States - we are attractive to people around the world to invest here because they basically believe the system is honest and clean. Countries that have bad conflicts of interest, lots of corruption - nobody wants to do business there. It hurts all of their citizens. So we all have a stake in America having a good reputation. MARTIN: So what are we expecting to happen this week? GEEWAX: On Thursday, the president-elect says he will have a press conference where he's going to talk about these conflicts of interest and how he plans to solve them. Most people are speculating that he's going to announce that he'll be turning over daily operations to his children, but most ethicists say (laughter) - the people who follow these things say that only total divestiture would really solve these problems. MARTIN: That's NPR's Marilyn Geewax. Thanks, Marilyn. GEEWAX: You're welcome. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"December 11, 2016","D.C. Family Leave Proposal Moves Forward, But Remains Controversial"," Earlier this year, we looked at a local proposal for paid leave here in Washington, D.C. As originally proposed, it would have been the most generous in the nation at 16 weeks. The proposal is moving forward with the local city council, but it remains controversial for many of the same reasons that such plans are moving slowly nationwide. Mainly they put a lot of pressure on small business. To sort all this out for us, we invited back Councilmember Elissa Silverman, one of the proposal's authors, to give us an update. Welcome back. Thanks for coming. ELISSA SILVERMAN: Great to be here, Michel. MARTIN: We also have here with us in the studio restaurant owner Jonathan Cho. He's got two restaurants in Washington, D.C. - Sakuramen, and he's the co-owner of BUL Korean Restaurant. JONATHAN CHO: That is correct. MARTIN: All right. Thanks so much for joining us as well. CHO: Thank you. MARTIN: So first, Councilwoman, to you. The original proposal was 16 weeks. Now it's down to eight weeks for parental leave, six weeks for family leave, two weeks for self-care. And it's also taken a long time, it seems to me, to move this through the system. Is that true? SILVERMAN: We've had a robust discussion about this bill, Michel. We've had three public hearings. I introduced the bill with my co-introducer, David Grosso, in October of 2015, and here we are in December of 2016 debating the bill. We've had a first vote. It passed 11 to 2. And we're on to our second vote and hopefully implementation soon. MARTIN: Remind us again of how this is paid for. SILVERMAN: This is paid for through an employer-based payroll tax. It's a .62 tax - so very modest. In terms of the business side, we have done a study in our council's budget office showing that in fact in California, where they've had a program for a dozen years - in New Jersey, in Rhode Island - in fact this can be a very pro-business bill because there are business benefits. MARTIN: Jonathan, let's hear from you on this. CHO: I think that any existing program, whether it's across this country or around the world, are at least partially if not fully funded by payroll deductions. And it's not solely upon the business. Now, here in D.C., here we have this - a very well-intentioned goal to try to implement a paid family leave program which I believe most people are certainly supportive in principle. MARTIN: I was going to ask you that, though, because we didn't even get to that question - is, do you in principle think it's a good idea? CHO: Absolutely, but there are also... MARTIN: Wouldn't it be hard on you, though? I mean you're not a huge... CHO: It will definitely be... MARTIN: ...Business. I mean you're not, like, a big-box store... CHO: No, we're not. MARTIN: ...With hundreds of employees. How many do you have? CHO: No, we're not. We have about close to 50 total between the two restaurants. That's both full-time and part-time. MARTIN: So you would be covered by this. CHO: Yes, absolutely. MARTIN: OK. CHO: I think the D.C. law would actually cover anyone no matter how many employees you have. MARTIN: And you have to pay their entire salary for the entire period of leave. CHO: D.C. - no - D.C. is up to a thousand-dollar cap. I believe it's per week, which is the highest in the country. MARTIN: Elissa Silverman, (unintelligible) go back to this question because as my understanding is, as this bill was originally conceived, the original idea was that everybody would pay a little bit. Both workers and owners would pay a little bit. Wasn't that right? SILVERMAN: So Michel, I want to - I hope that Jonathan will be enrolled in our problem and your listeners will be enrolled in our problem that we're not a state. Congress restricts our ability to tax income at its source, which means we can't tax commuters who live out of state and then work in our city, which is a majority of the workers in our city. MARTIN: Well, that leads to the question, though, that the major paper in the Washington, D.C., area, The Washington Post, has suggested that that's part of the problem here - that you've got a benefit that is being paid for solely by district business people. But most of the people who would benefit don't live in the city. Is that, A, true? And is that fair? SILVERMAN: I don't think it's fair because this is a pro-business bill. MARTIN: But it's true. SILVERMAN: Well, it helps district businesses in terms of lower costs because they're going to have lower employee turnover. That is a tremendous savings to businesses. MARTIN: And how do you respond to that, Jonathan? CHO: I already take very good care of my employees, and they're already well-incentivized through our regular compensation. The fact that D.C. has raised the minimum wage and it's going to be 15 - a full $15 - we've already made adjustments to try to accommodate that law. Now we're being asked yet again to make adjustments. And to exactly your point, we can't tax Maryland and Virginia residents who work in D.C. - that somehow we're going to still force this law through on the backs of small businesses. You know what? They'll just make more assessments. Just by saying this is going to help businesses long-term does not make it true. SILVERMAN: Every time we do something to benefit working families in our city - when we banned smoking, I heard that every restaurant was going to move to Virginia and, you know, the heart of tobacco country and Altria's headquarters. Then when we raised the minimum wage, I heard that this was going to devastate businesses. Our economy is one of the strongest in the country and stronger than our neighbors. When we gave workers paid sick days - heard the same thing. Our economy continues to grow. So I can make a correlation saying, you know what? When we pass bills that actually help working families, our economy improves. MARTIN: Jonathan, I gave Councilmember Silverman in the first word, so I'll give you the last word on this. CHO: OK. When you present a very human situation at people who may encounter life situations, whether that's a baby or a sickness and so on, of course the human, natural, obvious reaction is society needs to do something that's going to help them. But at the same time, I think that the D.C. Council - in their zeal to accomplish the very noble goal of delivering paid family leave, they've ultimately violated a fundamental principle of sustainable governance, which is, if you're trying to be socially responsible in your governing but if you do so in a fiscally irresponsible manner, it's going to be ultimately self-defeating and non-sustainable. MARTIN: That's Jonathan Cho. He owns two restaurants in Washington, D.C. We also heard from D.C. Councilmember Elissa Silverman. Thank you both so much for talking with us. SILVERMAN: Thank you, Michel. CHO: Thank you. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

npr,"December 11, 2016","Who Is Rex Tillerson, Trump's Reported Pick For Secretary Of State?"," To learn more about all this, we called Steve Coll, staff writer at The New Yorker. He reports on national security issues and wrote about Rex Tillerson in his book ""Private Empire: ExxonMobil And American Power."" Steve Coll is on the line with us from New York City. Steve, thanks so much for joining us. STEVE COLL: Thanks for having me. MARTIN: First tell us a little bit if you would about who Rex Tillerson is. COLL: Well, he's a Texan. He grew up. His father was a modestly salaried administrator with the Boy Scouts of America. He was an Eagle Scout. He went to the University of Texas and joined Exxon shortly after graduating and has been there 40 years. Like a lot of executives at the company, he rose through the ranks, became chief executive about 10 years ago. He spent a lot of his time in the international division, and that's where he developed the ties to Russia that we've heard a lot about this week. MARTIN: Now, you said in a piece posted this weekend for The New Yorker that the news that he is Donald Trump's choice to lead the Department of State is astonishing on many levels - why astonishing? COLL: Well, it's unusual in the first instance to have someone come into government at a Cabinet-level position who has never served the United States government really in any capacity during his lifetime. Of course businessmen make the transition fairly often to government service, but often they've been involved with federal jobs before. They've come and gone from industry to government. And so here you have someone who is coming entirely from the private sector with no experience of government leadership. Secondly, the oil industry is a different industry compared to the typical ones that produce national leadership. ExxonMobil is a very large corporation that really sees itself as an independent sovereign in the world. It has revenue the size of the economy of South Africa. It operates all over the world, negotiating with leaders on behalf of its shareholders. It's kind of a parallel quasi-state. And so it raises all kinds of questions about how someone like Tillerson, who of course I assume is a patriotic, loyal American - nonetheless, he spent all of his life negotiating on behalf of Exxon's interests, which are not always the same as the interests of the United States and the countries where he's worked. So it would be a very unusual transition to the State Department. MARTIN: Well, considering these new reports on possible Russian interference in the election to get Donald Trump into the White House, can you tell us what Tillerson's relationship has been with the Russian government and with President Vladimir Putin in particular? COLL: Well, it was his job at various stages of his career to negotiate oil deals in Russia - post-Soviet Russia, and he did so successfully over a long period of years. And that brought him into contact with Vladimir Putin. ExxonMobil is one of the few American oil companies that has managed to stay in Russia through all kinds of political weather. They had a big project out in Siberia that Tillerson was involved in negotiating. And then more recently, he signed a very ambitious deal with Rosneft, the Russian oil and gas company that's close to Putin. And that was to drill in the Arctic. Now, that deal has been slowed down by sanctions the United States and Europe have imposed on Russia because of its annexation of Crimea and its interference in Ukraine. But the larger point is that Tillerson has been coming and going from Moscow for a long time. He's built strong personal relationships around these business negotiations. He knows Putin well personally. He also knows some of Putin's most powerful aides quite well. MARTIN: And some might consider that to be an asset, a benefit to the country in this particular position. In fact that was really the basis of one of the arguments that Donald Trump made for his own candidacy, which is that he is a businessman who has transnational interests who knows how to negotiate with people and would not be affected by personal monetary considerations because he's already quite wealthy. Wouldn't the same argument apply for Rex Tillerson? COLL: It could. The question would be whether - of course the United States' interests and a relationship with Russia are quite different from ExxonMobil's. ExxonMobil has sought a stable relationship with Russia understandably so that ExxonMobil can produce oil there and make money for its shareholders. The United States is a member of the NATO alliance committed to the defense of the Baltic states and European countries that are quite nervous about Russia. The United States certainly has looked on with dismay as Russia has gone outside of its borders over the last couple of years into Ukraine, taking Crimea. Its activism in Syria certainly raise a lot of questions about whether Vladimir Putin is someone that the United States wants to have a friendly relationship with or whether his ambitions are something the United States should be seeking to contain. And so if Rex Tillerson has views about Russia as an American leader that are distinct from the views he has managed as ExxonMobil's chief executive, then that's something I'm sure that even Republican senators like John McCain are going to want him to clarify if he's nominated for confirmation by the Senate.

npr,"December 11, 2016",Sen. Jack Reed Wants To Examine Claims Of Russian Cyberattacks," (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: I think the Democrats are putting it out because they suffered one of the greatest defeats in the history of politics in this country. And frankly I think they're putting it out, and it's ridiculous. MARTIN: As of this morning, though, Democrats are not the only ones expressing concern. Two Republicans - John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina - joined New York Democrat and incoming Minority Leader Charles Schumer and Rhode Island's Jack Reed on a separate statement saying that the CIA's reports of Russian interference should be taken seriously. Senator John McCain told CBS he was baffled by the president-elect's response. Senator McCain said he wants a special committee to investigate alleged Russian interference. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOHN MCCAIN: It's going to require congressional involvement. It's going to require in-depth and - by the way, the Russians have interfered in a lot of other elections. The Russians have hacked into some of our most secret military information. MARTIN: We reached out to all of the senators who signed the statement. Democratic Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island was able to join us. He is the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee of which Senator McCain is the chair, and he's with us now. Senator Reed, thank you so much for speaking with us. JACK REED: Thank you. MARTIN: So first tell us what you want to see happen now. REED: Well, the intelligence community has done a careful assessment of the facts, and they have reached with a high sense of confidence a conclusion that there was penetration of both the Democratic organization and the Republican organization but that it appears that only information detrimental to the Democratic candidate was released, raising questions of, one, the motivation of the Russians - also questions of going forward, of the integrity of our campaign system not just in this past election but future elections. So these are serious questions that have to be looked at closely. I'm very pleased that Chairman McCain and Senator Lindsey Graham recognize this and are taking a leadership role along with Senator Schumer. But this is a question of significant importance not just for the moment but for the future of the country and our democratic process. MARTIN: But the president-elect is very dismissive of presumably the same information that you have access to. So what do you make of that? REED: It's very difficult to understand the evidence and the conclusion which was not drawn lightly by the intelligence community - what has been publicized. I'm not saying anything that was not made public, and I think it raises serious questions. And rather than trying to deny the facts or the conclusion, I think the appropriate course is what Senator McCain, Schumer and myself, Senator Graham have suggested, which is to go ahead and look very closely, again protecting our sources and methods of collection so we don't do anything that would undermine our ability to continue our counter-espionage efforts but give the American people the facts. Don't jump to a conclusion, particularly one that seems to be contrary to the facts that have been assembled. MARTIN: Before we let you go, is the critical issue here that you want to know what happened but you also want the public to know what happened? Is the critical piece of this that you want some vehicle by which the public can know what went on? REED: Well, I think, one, we want to know what happened. Two, we want to ensure that we can take appropriate steps so that we will not be vulnerable to this type of operation again in future elections so that we can reassure the public that they can be confident that our elections are decided by debate, discussion, door-to-door activity, not by some foreign intelligence service and their influence. And then I think the issue of getting those facts out to the public is also critical, too. MARTIN: That's Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island. He's the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Armed Services. He was 1 of the 4 senators who released a statement today - a bipartisan statement today in response to news reports on the CIA's analysis of Russian interference with the 2016 election. Senator Reed, thank you so much for speaking with us. REED: Thank you very much. Copyright © 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"December 11, 2016",FACT CHECK: Trump Falsely Claims A 'Massive Landslide Victory'," President-elect Donald Trump doesn't seem to like suggestions that his victory over Hillary Clinton was anything but huge. Trump made false claims that Clinton's lead in the popular vote was due to illegal voting. He has chafed at recount efforts in states like Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania — even though such recounts pose no risk to Trump's victory, since he won those states by tens of thousands of votes. And now, with a CIA assessment that Russian hacking during the campaign was part of an effort to swing the election Trump's way, he's hitting back hard at the intelligence agency — and renewing claims that his win was of historic proportions. The Claim ""We had a massive landslide victory, as you know, in the Electoral College. I guess the final numbers are now at 306,"" Trump said in an interview on Fox News Sunday. A statement from his transition team on Friday, in response to reports of the CIA assessment, said, ""The election ended a long time ago in one of the biggest Electoral College victories in history."" Trump also said in his Fox interview, ""I think the Democrats are putting it out because they suffered one of the greatest defeats in the history of politics in this country."" The Short Answer Trump contends that the size of his victory was historic, which is not borne out by the results. Trump won 306 electoral votes to Clinton's 232. That puts him comfortably above the required 270 electoral votes. But it's hard to argue this represents a landslide of historic proportions, given that out of 58 presidential elections, the winner has received more electoral votes in 37 contests. The Long Answer Trump's win is historic, but mainly because it was so unexpected. He was outpaced by Hillary Clinton on nearly every conventional metric applied to successful campaigns. Trump was counted out by nearly every political professional and most of the media. Even his own campaign allies were expecting a loss. So the voters delivered a truly historic upset on Election Day. By that measure, Trump's statement about ""one of the greatest defeats"" holds up. Comparing Trump's 306 electoral votes to recent history, he falls between the 2000 and 2004 razor-thin margins of George W. Bush, and Barack Obama's victories in 2008 and 2012. So on the historic score, Trump's margin is pretty average for recent elections, and way down the list if you go all the way back to the beginning of the nation. Jack Pitney, a professor of politics at Claremont McKenna College, recently calculated the electoral college margins in all 58 U.S. presidential elections, and showed Trump coming in 46th. Separately, there's the question of whether Trump's victory is a ""landslide."" President Obama is sometimes said to have achieved ""electoral landslides,"" but that is even stretching historical standards. Clear landslides came most recently in the 1980s. Ronald Reagan won 489 electoral votes to Jimmy Carter's 49 in the 1980 election. Four years later, Reagan won 49 states, delivering him a 525 to 13 victory over Walter Mondale. In 1988, George H.W. Bush succeeded Reagan by amassing 426 electoral votes to Michael Dukakis' 111. Each of those Reagan and Bush victories came with an 8 to 9 percent margin in the popular vote, as icing on the cake. 
                Trump currently trails Hillary Clinton by about 2.8 million votes. There have been five candidates who lost the popular vote, but won the Electoral College.

 To be certain, Trump's win in the Electoral College is what matters. But his loss in the popular vote to Hillary Clinton is itself historic. At 2.8 million votes, Trump's deficit is by far the largest for any candidate who won the Electoral College and lost the popular vote.

npr,"December 11, 2016","As Trump Dismisses CIA, Congress Looks To Confront Russian Cyberattacks"," A bipartisan group of four senators is calling for Congress to take a closer look at allegations that Russia used cyberattacks to try to influence the American election in favor of Donald Trump. The reports should ""alarm every American,"" Sens. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.; Jack Reed, D-R.I.; John McCain, R-Ariz.; and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said in a joint statement. ""Congress's national security committees have worked diligently to address the complex challenge of cybersecurity, but recent events show that more must be done,"" the senators said. ""While protecting classified material, we have an obligation to inform the public about recent cyberattacks that have cut to the heart of our free society. Democrats and Republicans must work together, and across the jurisdictional lines of the Congress, to examine these recent incidents thoroughly and devise comprehensive solutions to deter and defend against further cyberattacks."" The statement was a tacit rebuke of President-elect Donald Trump, who has said he doesn't believe the CIA, which concluded Russia intervened in the 2016 election in order to help him win the presidency. The reaction from congressional Republicans sets the stage for hearings next year on Russian interference on Capitol Hill as the new Republican president dismisses the issue. Trump dismissed the CIA assessment as a partisan hit in his appearance on Fox News Sunday. ""I think the Democrats are putting it out because they suffered one of the greatest defeats in the history of politics in this country,"" Trump said. He also referred to ""a massive landslide victory"" in the Electoral College. While Trump's victory may have been the most stunning upset in American political history, it was far from historic in size. Trump won 306 electoral votes to Hillary Clinton's 232, which ranks as the 46th largest Electoral College margin, out of 58 elections. Trump is also behind Clinton in the popular vote by 2.8 million, by far the largest popular vote deficit ever for a winning candidate. On Face the Nation on CBS, McCain said that no matter what Trump says the facts are clear: Russia conducted cyberattacks in the United States to try to influence the election. ""Now whether they intended to interfere to the degree that they were trying to elect a certain candidate, I think that's the subject of investigation,"" McCain said. ""But facts are stubborn things, they did hack into this campaign."" McCain said that this issue is bigger than partisan politics because it affects free and fair elections, the bedrock of American democracy. He said he would prefer for a special committee to take on the investigation, but this is such a serious issue that his Armed Services Committee will start work right away. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, who chairs the House Homeland Security Committee, has also called for an investigation. Other House Republicans, including New York Rep. Peter King and California Rep. Devin Nunes, a major Trump supporter, have said they do not doubt Russia is responsible for the cyberattacks. That's to say nothing of the outcry among Democrats. On Friday, President Obama ordered a full review of ""malicious cyber activity"" that coincided with the elections, which could result in a report just as Trump is taking office. The review will go all the way back to 2008, when China was found to have hacked both the Obama and McCain presidential campaigns. McCain said he welcomed Obama's review, but he also cautioned that a comprehensive investigation would take much longer than the time Obama has left in office.

npr,"December 11, 2016",Trump Says He Won't Sell His Businesses To Address Conflicts Of Interest," President-elect Donald Trump suggested Sunday that he will not sell off his business operations to avoid conflicts of interest during his presidency. He said he will instead allow his grown children to manage them. ""My executives will run it with my children. It's a big company. It's a great company. But I'm going to have nothing to do with management,"" Trump told Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday. Trump said recently that he will take steps to separate himself from his business operations and will announce details at a major press conference this coming Thursday. That announcement led to speculation about whether Trump planned to divest himself from his businesses by selling off his vast network of hotels, golf courses and licensing agreements. But the comments Sunday suggest nothing has really changed since Trump first began addressing the issue during the campaign, and that Trump has no intention of selling. ""You know, when you sell real estate, that's not like going out and selling a stock. That takes a long time,"" Trump said. Former government ethics officers say that by continuing to own businesses while president, Trump allows himself and his family to profit from his office and opens himself up to numerous conflicts of interest. Trump's comments Sunday do little to address those conflicts, says Meredith McGehee, chief of policy, programs and strategy at Issue One, a nonprofit group dedicated to removing money from politics. ""Let's be clear: This is not divestment of foreign holdings. And it's not any kind of blind trust. The bottom line is that, with his children in charge of operations, no way meaningful firewall can exist,"" McGehee said. ""Rather this arrangement enables him to enrich himself and his family through his administration's policies and actions,and will be interpreted by many across the world as a signal of how to gain access and influence with his administration,"" she added. Norm Eisen, visiting fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, said Trump had not come close to addressing the issue. ""His children and his executives and his businesses are going to become a magnet for improper influence in the United States and around the world,"" Eisen said. ""Quids are constantly going to be dangled, and how long will it be before a quo follows?"" During the interview Wallace pressed Trump about the conflicts of interest, noting that ""foreign countries are already booking events at the Trump Hotel in D.C. You've got business operations, deals with foreign countries."" Trump replied that he has no interest in making money while in the White House. He said he had ""turned down seven deals with one big player, great player, last week because I thought it could be perceived as a conflict of interest."" ""If I were going to do new deals right now, I am turning down billions of dollars of deals. I will tell you, running for president, the money I spent is peanuts compared to the money I won't make. And that's OK because this is so important. What I'm doing is so important."" When Wallace noted that allowing his children to manage the company was ""the same thing,"" Trump replied: ""They're not making deals. And they're going to run my company. I have a lot of property and great stuff. They're going to run it. They're going to run it. Hopefully they're going to run it properly. I'm sure they're going to run it properly. But I'm not going to do deals. And I think, you know, I think that's going to be good."" But Eisen said that arrangement would not resolve conflicts, unless Trump signs over everything to an independent trustee immediately. ""Although it is of course important that Mr. Trump have no involvement in Trump business operations, in order to avoid conflicts, he must also exit the ownership of his businesses through using a blind trust or equivalent. Otherwise he will have a personal financial interest in his businesses that will sometimes conflict with the public interest, and constantly raise questions and legal issues,"" Eisen said. ""For example, unless he divests ownership, he will have an interest in the foreign government payments and benefits that flow to his businesses daily,"" he said. ""That creates such a serious conflict of interest that the framers of the constitution prohibited it for the president in the emoluments clause. Far smaller potential conflicts led every president for four decades to do a blind trust or the equivalent, and so should Trump."" When Wallace pointed out that Trump had ""hammered"" his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, over ""pay to play"" conflicts involving the Clinton Foundation, Trump insisted the two situations were different. ""She's taken in massive amounts of money from foreign countries and other things,"" he said.

 Russian President Vladimir Putin and Rex Tillerson, chairman and CEO of Exxon Mobil during a signing ceremony for an arctic oil exploration deal between Exxon Mobil and Rosneft in August 2011. Though he has no government experience, the 64-year-old Tillerson oversees a company that has operations in 50 countries around the world and has worked closely with Putin. In 2011, he struck a deal with a Kremlin-controlled oil company to drill in the Arctic, but the project was put on hold after the U.S. and Europe imposed sanctions on Russia over its actions in Ukraine, according to the Wall Street Journal. Tillerson has opposed U.S. sanctions against Russia, telling his company's shareholders in May 2014 that ""we don't find them to be effective unless they are very well implemented comprehensively and that's a very hard thing to do,"" according to NBC News. The prospect of Tillerson as secretary of state sparked a round of criticism from Democrats, and even pushback from Republican senators who would vote on his nomination. Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which conducts hearings for secretary of state nominees, and tweeted on Sunday, ""Being a 'friend of Vladimir' is not an attribute I am hoping for from a #SecretaryOfState."" Senator John McCain, R-Ariz., pledged that Tillerson will get a fair hearing in the Senate during at interview with CBS's Face The Nation, but added, ""It's a matter of concern to me that he has such a close personal relationship with Vladimir Putin."" Trump and his transition team insist that no final decision has been made and that an announcement is coming this week. Whether I choose him or not for ""State""- Rex Tillerson, the Chairman &amp; CEO of ExxonMobil, is a world class player and dealmaker. Stay tuned! Trump praised many of the candidates he has interviewed for the job in an interview on Fox News Sunday, where he was asked to make the case for Tillerson. ""He's much more than a business executive. I mean, he's a world class player,"" Trump said of the ExxonMobil chief. ""It's been a company that's been unbelievably managed,"" Trump continued. ""And to me, a great advantage is he knows many of the players, and he knows them well. He does massive deals in Russia. He does massive deals for the company, not for himself, for the company."" Tillerson represented his company in Russia during Boris Yeltsin's administration, and in 2013 the Kremlin awarded him Russia's ""Order of Friendship."" The news of Tillerson's likely nomination comes just as the CIA has concluded that Russia intervened in the 2016 election specifically to help Trump win. Trump pushed back on that report late Friday, in a statement that disparaged the CIA but didn't address Russia's involvement. Throughout the campaign, Trump repeatedly praised Putin and questioned earlier reports from the CIA that Russian hackers were behind the release of emails from the Democratic National Committee. Trump's deliberation over who should serve as the country's chief diplomat has been very public. In an interview process that has seemed at times to mirror the drama that the former reality TV star loves, other finalists for the job included Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn.; former CIA Director David Petraeus; and 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, a leading critic of Trump in the 2016 campaign. Romney recanted his comments calling Trump a ""phony"" and a ""fraud"" as he lobbied for the secretary of state job. Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton was also seen in contention, but reports indicate he is likely to be named as deputy secretary of state, responsible for daily operations as the State Department. Bolton served under President George W. Bush in the State Department and as U.N. ambassador, and he stands by the decision to invade Iraq in 2003 and overthrow Saddam Hussein. He also advocates for tearing up the Iran nuclear agreement reached by the Obama administration. Bolton said recently that the only lasting solution is ""regime change in Tehran."" Another onetime top pick, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, announced Friday he had taken himself out of the running, though earlier reports had indicated it was Trump who had already decided that one of his most fervent supporters and frequent surrogates would not get the plum post. If Tillerson is nominated, there will be some tough questions ahead about how he can take on the role of America's top diplomat and distance himself from his company's interests and his vast holdings of Exxon shares, which are reportedly worth about $151 million. There are some breaks between Tillerson and the president-elect. According to The Hill, Tillerson does believe in man-made climate change and supports the Paris climate agreement that Trump opposes.  Tillerson is a Texas native and has run ExxonMobil since 2006. He began his career at Exxon as an engineer in 1975. Michele Kelemen, Meg Anderson and Arnie Seipel contributed.
