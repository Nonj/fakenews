economist,Oct 27th 2017,Cataloniaâ€™s parliament declares independence; Spain imposes direct rule," The Senate duly approved Mr Rajoyâ€™s request, backed by the opposition Socialists, to apply Article 155 of the constitution in Catalonia. Never used before, this grants the government wide powers to compel a region to obey the constitution. Mr Rajoy justified this â€œexceptional decisionâ€ù by referring to the Catalan administrationâ€™s â€œcontinued process of anti-democratic decisions, against the law and Spanish and European valuesâ€ù. Apart from the dismissal of Mr Puigdemont's executive, Mr Rajoy announced the shutting down of the Catalan government's offices abroad. The government is also likely to replace the commanders of the Catalan police force, and take over the Catalan government's finances and IT centre. At the urging of the opposition Socialists, the government has dropped the idea of taking the public broadcasters in Catalonia. The dissolution of the Catalan parliament and the swift calling of a new election came as a surprise (Mr Rajoy had earlier talked of an election ""within six months""). It suggests that he does not want direct rule to become the subject of a lengthy conflict. Even so, it was unclear whether the Catalan civil service will accept the government's orders. Mr Rajoy is likely to face civil disobedience and strikes, especially if prosecutors opt to charge Mr Puigdemont and his colleagues with rebellion, which carries up to 30 years in jail. Already two leaders of the independence movement have been detained on suspicion of sedition for organising a demonstration in Barcelona last month that hindered a police raid against organisers of an unauthorised independence referendum on October 1st. Mr Puigdemont claims a mandate from that referendum, in which Catalan officials say some 43% of the electorate voted, 90% of them for independence. But they face some unpleasant realities: since October 1st, more than 1,500 companies, including almost all the big ones, have moved their domicile outside the region, and tourist bookings have dipped. The secessionists have brought Spain to a deadlock. Mr Rajoy has agreed to a Socialist proposal to set up a congressional committee to discuss constitutional reform. If there is a solution to the countryâ€™s ills, that is where it lies. But first he must win his trial of strength in Catalonia.",http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21730778-mutual-mistrust-between-two-administrations-scuppered-deal-avoid-head-clash
economist,Oct 21st 2017,The latest AI can work things out without being taught," Like all the best games, Go is easy to learn but hard to master. Two players, Black and White, take turns placing stones on the intersections of a board consisting of 19 vertical lines and 19 horizontal ones. The aim is to control more territory than your opponent. Stones that are surrounded by an opponentâ€™s are removed from the board. Players carry on until neither wishes to continue. Each then adds the number of his stones on the board to the number of empty grid intersections he has surrounded. The larger total is the winner. The difficulty comes from the sheer number of possible moves. A 19x19 board offers 361 different places on which Black can put the initial stone. White then has 360 options in response, and so on. The total number of legal board arrangements is in the order of 10170, a number so large it defies any physical analogy (there are reckoned to be about 1080 atoms in the observable universe, for instance). Human experts focus instead on understanding the game at a higher level. Goâ€™s simple rules give rise to plenty of emergent structure. Players talk of features such as â€œeyesâ€ù and â€œladdersâ€ù, and of concepts such as â€œthreatâ€ù and â€œlife-and-deathâ€ù. But although human players understand such concepts, explaining them in the hyper-literal way needed to program a computer is much harder. Instead, the original AlphaGo studied thousands of examples of human games, a process called supervised learning. Since human play reflects human understanding of such concepts, a computer exposed to enough of it can come to understand those concepts as well. Once AlphaGo had arrived at a decent grasp of tactics and strategy with the help of its human teachers, it kicked away its crutches and began playing millions of unsupervised training games against itself, improving its play with every game. Supervised learning is useful for much more than Go. It is the basic idea behind many of the recent advances in AI, helping computers learn to do things such as identify faces in pictures, recognise human speech reliably, filter spam from e-mail efficiently and more. But as Demis Hassabis, Deepmindâ€™s boss, observes, supervised learning has limits. It relies on the availability of training data to feed to the computer to show the machine what it is meant to be doing. Such data must be filtered by human experts. The training data for face recognition, for instance, consist of thousands of pictures, some with faces and some without, each labelled as such by a person. That makes such data sets expensive, assuming they are available at all. And, as the paper points out, there can be more subtle problems. Relying on human experts for guidance risks imposing human limits on a computerâ€™s ability. AlphaGo Zero is designed to avoid all these problems by skipping the training-wheels phase entirely. The program starts only with the rules of the game and a â€œreward functionâ€ù, which awards it a point for a win and docks a point for a loss. It is then encouraged to experiment, repeatedly playing games against other versions of itself, subject only to the constraint that it must try to maximise its reward by winning as much as possible. The program started by placing stones randomly, with no real idea of what it was doing. But it improved rapidly. After a single day it was playing at the level of an advanced professional. After two days it had surpassed the performance of the version that beat Mr Lee in 2016. DeepMindâ€™s researchers were able to watch their creation rediscover the Go knowledge that human beings have accumulated over thousands of years. Sometimes, it seemed eerily human-like. After about three hours of training the program was preoccupied with the idea of greedily capturing stones, a phase that most human beginners also go through. At others it seemed decidedly alien. For example, ladders are patterns of stones that extend in a diagonal slash across the board as one player attempts to capture a group of his opponentâ€™s stones. They are frequent features of Go games. Because a ladder consists of a simple, repeating pattern, human novices quickly learn to extrapolate them and work out if building a particular ladder will succeed or fail. But AlphaGo Zeroâ€”which is not capable of extrapolation, and instead experiments with new moves semi-randomlyâ€”took longer than expected to come to grips with the concept. Climbing the ladder Nevertheless, learning for itself rather than relying on hints from people seemed, on balance, to be a big advantage. For example, joseki are specialised sequences of well-known moves that take place near the edges of the board. (Their scripted nature makes them a little like chess openings.) AlphaGo Zero discovered the standard joseki taught to human players. But it also discovered, and eventually preferred, several others that were entirely of its own invention. The machine, says David Silver, who led the AlphaGo project, seemed to play with a distinctly non-human style. The result is a program that is not just superhuman, but crushingly so. Skill at Go (and chess, and many other games) can be quantified with something called an Elo rating, which gives the probability, based on past performance, that one player will beat another. A player has a 50:50 chance of beating an opponent with the same Elo rating, but only a 25% chance of beating one with a rating 200 points higher. Mr Ke has a rating of 3,661. Mr Leeâ€™s is 3,526. After 40 days of training AlphaGo Zero had an Elo rating of more than 5,000â€”putting it as far ahead of Mr Ke as Mr Ke is of a keen amateur, and suggesting that it is, in practice, impossible for Mr Ke, or any other human being, ever to defeat it. When it played against the version of AlphaGo that first beat Mr Lee, it won by 100 games to zero. There is, of course, more to life than Go. Algorithms such as the ones that power the various iterations of AlphaGo might, its creators hope, be applied to other tasks that are conceptually similar. (DeepMind has already used those that underlie the original AlphaGo to help Google slash the power consumption of its data centres.) But an algorithm that can learn without guidance from people means that machines can be let loose on problems that people do not understand how to solve. Anything that boils down to an intelligent search through an enormous number of possibilities, said Mr Hassabis, could benefit from AlphaGoâ€™s approach. He cited classic thorny problems such as working out how proteins fold into their final, functional shapes, predicting which molecules might have promise as medicines, or accurately simulating chemical reactions. Advances in AI often trigger worries about human obsolescence. DeepMind hopes such machines will end up as assistants to biological brains, rather than replacements for them, in the way that other technologies from search engines to paper have done. Watching a machine invent new ways to tackle a problem can, after all, help push people down new and productive paths. One of the benefits of AlphaGo, says Mr Silver, is that, in a game full of history and tradition, it has encouraged human players to question the old wisdom, and to experiment. After losing to AlphaGo, Mr Ke studied the computerâ€™s moves, looking for ideas. He then went on a 22-game winning streak against human opponents, an impressive feat even for someone of his skill. Supervised learning, after all, can work in both directions.

economist,Oct 27th 2017,The politics of helping Middle Eastern Christians," That marks a concession to a long-standing demand by faith-inspired charities who say religious minorities, especially Christians and Yazidis, have been neglected by the UN. One particular complaint is that non-Muslims are wary of entering UN-administered refugee camps where the overwhelming majority of residents are Muslim. This, it is alleged, has left the job of looking after displaced non-Muslims to voluntary agencies. The exact implications of Mr Penceâ€™s announcement remain to be seen. USAID, which faces big cuts in its overall budget by the Trump administration, already funnels a lot of aid through religiously affiliated agencies such as Catholic Relief Services. But the vice-president, a stridently conservative Christian, struck a rhetorical note: The United Nations has too often failed to help the most vulnerable communities, especially religious minorities. The result has been that countless people continue to suffer and struggle needlessly. Hereâ€™s the sad reality: The United Nations claims that more than 160 projects are in Christian areas, but for a third of those projects, there are no Christians to help. The believers in Nineveh, Iraq, have had less than 2% of their housing needs addressed, and the majority of Christians and Yazidis remain in shelters. And while faith-based groups with proven track records and deep roots in these communities are more than willing to assist, the United Nations too often denies their funding requests. My friends, those days are over. A State Department spokeswoman said afterwards that the administration did not plan a total cut-off of money for UN bodies looking after the regionâ€™s refugees. However, â€œwe will look for other avenues in which to more efficiently fund these types of religious minorities so that they can eventually return back home,"" she added. Nina Shea, a specialist on and advocate for faith groups in the Middle East, said Mr Penceâ€™s statement could portend rescue at the 11th hour at a time when religious diversity in the region was hanging by a thread. It was also consistent with the administrationâ€™s stated view that Christians, Yazidis and some Shia Muslims were victims of a genocidal campaign. But the extent of any change in policy would only be seen if and when a presidential directive was issued, said Ms Shea, who runs the Center for Religious Freedom at the Hudson Institute, a think-tank.Â Â  In any case, not all hard-pressed Middle Eastern Christians place their hopes on the Trump administration. Last month, the World Council of Churches and Catholic clergy from the region organised a meeting in Geneva to protest against the ongoing expropriation of land in the Cremisan Valley outside Bethlehem. This month, Bethlehemâ€™s Christian mayor took space in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz to say he was baffled and dismayed by the support of American conservative Christians for the expansion of Israeli settlements at the expense of his people. Cris de coeur like that can expect no sympathy whatever from conservative American Christians like Mr Pence, who generally lean to the hawkish side of the Israeli spectrum.Â  NextThe scope, and limits, of Austriaâ€™s Christian zeal ",https://www.economist.com/blogs/erasmus/2017/10/american-aid
economist,Oct 26th 2017,Peacekeepers in name only," Cosying up to the bad guys The failings in Myanmar are reminiscent of those of the UNâ€™s mission in Sri Lanka at the end of the civil war in 2009 between the government and the Tamil Tigers, a guerrilla group. An internal review led by Charles Petrie, a former UN official, concluded there had been â€œsystemic failureâ€ù. Mr Petrie accused the members of the Sri Lankan mission of appeasing the government in Colombo, so that they could promote their development work and receive international aid. Standing up for human rights was often deemed too difficult. In Myanmar, instead of confronting the government on behalf of the Rohingya, the UN championed a policy of development for all in Rakhine state. That ignored how the delivery of services would inevitably be channelled through, and controlled by, those in power, namely Buddhist Rakhine politicians, the enemies of Rohingyas. A report commissioned by the mission in Myanmar in 2015 pointed out that such an approach would be â€œmore likely to reinforce discrimination than change itâ€ù. The Petrie report chronicled how the Sri Lankan mission recorded all the civilian deaths attributed to the Tamil Tigers, but understated the numbers of civilians killed or wounded by the armyâ€”again, to keep the government sweet. This pattern was also apparent in Rwanda in 1994 and in the United Nations-African Union Mission in Darfur (UNAMID), one of the UNâ€™s largest-ever peacekeeping operations, established in 2007. In 2013 Aicha Elbasri, the spokeswoman for the mission, resigned, handing in a list of 16 cases where UNAMID had â€œconcealedâ€ù assaults on civilians and even UN peacekeepers. Ban Ki-moon, Mr Guterresâ€™s predecessor, commissioned another UN review, which upheld five of the complaints. Ms ElBasri, Moroccan by birth, argues that the deceptions were carried out to avoid offending the Sudanese government of Omar al-Bashir, adding that Africans in the mission were keen to defend one of their own. Mr Ban said that the â€œtendency to underreportâ€ù had left him â€œdeeply troubledâ€ù. But no one was held accountable, and nobody had to resign. The whistleblower, however, forfeited her job. Missions need the consent of the host governments to operate; the UN cannot invade. But too often agencies and blue helmets (as in the headgear worn by peacekeepers) are lackeys of autocrats, forming â€œabusiveâ€ù relationships with those in power, according to Richard Gowan of Columbia University. This undermines the UNâ€™s claim to moral authority. The operation in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is a case in point. The UN has deployed peacekeepers there since 1999, and MONUSCO, the French acronym by which the mission is known, now has about 16,000 troops, and costs more than $1bn a year. Since 2016, the UN has failed to prevent violence that has forced over 1m people to flee their homes. Troops get away with defining their operating boundaries conservatively. Perversely, they are rewarded for not using their kit, as they are reimbursed for equipment returned in good condition. Meanwhile MONUSCO cannot easily get rid of underperforming civilian staff, partly because of pressure from trade unions but also because of the complex way in which UN headquarters imposes its choice of recruits on the mission. Standing idle Another $1bn-per-year mission, UNMISS, has done almost nothing to prevent the descent into civil war and famine since South Sudan gained independence from Sudan in 2011. The 12,500 peacekeepers have a mandate to protect civilians, but have failed to do so. In August 2016 aid workers were raped, beaten and robbed by South Sudanese government troops just minutes away from the main UN compound in Juba, the capital. Despite desperate phone and text messages from the victims, the 2,000 or so troops never stirred. â€œ[The blue helmets] are supposed to protect civilians,â€ù admits a UN official in South Sudan. â€œBut they donâ€™t. Something is upside down. Itâ€™s not working.â€ù One reason for the failure is that the mission asks permission from the government before it sends out troops, fearing that otherwise politicians will obstruct the delivery of food and medicine to the starving and the sick even more than they already do. But since it is often the government carrying out the massacres, permission is often refused or delayed. <img alt="""" class=""component-image__img blog-post-article-image"" data-reactid=""491"" sizes=""(min-width: 600px) 640px, calc(100vw - 20px)"" src=""https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20171028_IRP002_0.jpg"" srcset=""//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/200-width/images/print-edition/20171028_IRP002_0.jpg 200w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/300-width/images/print-edition/20171028_IRP002_0.jpg 300w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/400-width/images/print-edition/20171028_IRP002_0.jpg 400w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/640-width/images/print-edition/20171028_IRP002_0.jpg 640w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/800-width/images/print-edition/20171028_IRP002_0.jpg 800w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/1000-width/images/print-edition/20171028_IRP002_0.jpg 1000w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/1200-width/images/print-edition/20171028_IRP002_0.jpg 1200w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/1280-width/images/print-edition/20171028_IRP002_0.jpg 1280w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/1600-width/images/print-edition/20171028_IRP002_0.jpg 1600w""/>Fired up, not ready to go The UN argues that, despite the manifest failings of these missions, it is better to have them than not. The mere presence of its troops can sometimes deter attacks, and even if blue helmets are reluctant to go out and help civilians, at least the civilians can huddle in and around its bases for protection, as in South Sudan. The UN has no mandate to impose its will independently on a country. All peacekeeping missions are authorised by the Security Council, and subject to approval by the General Assembly, giving China and Russia ample room to minimise the scope of missions in the interests of their clients and allies. Such was the case in Sudan. China has considerable economic interests here, and it struggled for years to prevent any outside intervention in Darfur. Eventually, in 2007, it did concede to sending in UNAMID, but only after ensuring that the mission could cause Mr Bashir as little inconvenience as possible. The offer of Western troops was kept to an absolute minimum, denying UNAMID the sort of kit and operational efficiency that might have made a difference. Another reason why, when the call goes out from New York, peacekeeping generally attracts troops from poor countries (see chart), is because the pay is relatively high. But they are typically risk averse. Some forces commit crimes. Another whistleblower, Anders Kompass, exposed allegations of sexual abuse of young children by troops in the Central African Republic in 2015. <img alt="""" class=""component-image__img blog-post-article-image"" data-reactid=""499"" sizes=""(min-width: 600px) 640px, calc(100vw - 20px)"" src=""https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20171028_IRC067.png"" srcset=""//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/200-width/images/print-edition/20171028_IRC067.png 200w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/300-width/images/print-edition/20171028_IRC067.png 300w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/400-width/images/print-edition/20171028_IRC067.png 400w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/640-width/images/print-edition/20171028_IRC067.png 640w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/800-width/images/print-edition/20171028_IRC067.png 800w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/1000-width/images/print-edition/20171028_IRC067.png 1000w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/1200-width/images/print-edition/20171028_IRC067.png 1200w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/1280-width/images/print-edition/20171028_IRC067.png 1280w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/1600-width/images/print-edition/20171028_IRC067.png 1600w""/> Rather than take on the difficult task of improving peacekeeping operations, Mr Ban tried to encourage reporting of abuses of human rights. That way, the theory went, countries could avoid the crimes which would lead to the intervention of troops in the first place. His main initiative, â€œHuman Rights Up Frontâ€ù, required all staff to take responsibility for reporting abuses. But in Myanmar this policy has failed at first contact with the enemy. Remaking the peace Mr Guterres has a chance to do much better. For example, he could increase the annual budget for the human-rights office ($190m), which is dwarfed by the $12bn spent on the UN Development Programme (UNDP). He could have heads of mission report to him, not to UNDP, so as to reduce the risk that human-rights abuses are ignored by officials who rely on local politiciansâ€™ support for their pet projects. Mr Guterres has said he wants the UN to do more before the blue helmets have to wade in. In recent years it has tried to mediate between factions in several countries. Sometimes it has staved off all-out war, thus avoiding the need for peacekeepers. Kofi Annan, a former secretary-general, rescued Kenya from a descent into further violence after disputed elections in 2007, for example; a team helped to stabilise Guinea after a coup in the west African state in 2008; and the UN also brokered a deal in Madagascar in 2011. Building on these successes, Mr Guterres has called for a â€œsurge in diplomacy for peaceâ€ù, and has set up a â€œHigh-Level Advisory Board on Mediationâ€ù, which includes such luminaries as Michelle Bachelet, the president of Chile, and Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury. Jaw-jaw is, of course, better than war-war. But as the failure in Myanmar shows, the UN still has a lot to learn about keeping the peace.

economist,Oct 22nd 2017,"The scope, and limits, of Austriaâ€™s Christian zeal "," The cardinal caused some astonishmentÂ a year ago at a ceremony that marked the 333rd anniversary of the defeat of the Ottomans in the battle of Vienna. He asked rhetorically: ""Will there be an Islamic conquest of Europe? Many Muslims want that and say, Europe is at an end."" Challenged to elaborate on this thought, the cardinalÂ replied that his aim was not to provoke but to state a fact. Both Christianity and Islam were evangelistic religions which believed themselves to be bearers of a universal truth. It was therefore entirely natural for Muslims to hope that Europe would eventuallyÂ be won overÂ to their faith, just as he as a ChristianÂ would love to see his religion flourish again in places like Turkey or North AfricaÂ where it onceÂ shone forth. In other words, he was sounding theÂ trumpet for a battle of metaphysical ideas, not a physical contest. Can we expect the feistyÂ cardinal and theÂ boy-wonder politicianÂ to collaborate in advancing the Christian cause? To some extent, they have done so already. For example, in co-sponsoring acts of prayer for Christians being persecuted in the Middle East, a matter on which both have voiced strong feelings. But in truth there are limits to the politics of Christian nativism in today's Austria, as both gentlemen know.Â In interviews, Mr Kurz has always insisted that the Christian heritage andÂ value-system are preciousÂ to him, but he does not make any claim to be a frequent church-goer.Â The demands of his job made it hard to attend Mass regularly but he found it important to attend on feast-days, he recently said.Â For all the magnificence of its Baroque churches,Â Vienna is now a pretty secular, cosmopolitanÂ city and it would not take kindly to a political leader who presented a super-pious image.Â As for the cardinal, he mayÂ be a powerful figure inÂ the Vatican but plenty of his compatriotsÂ have ceased to pay much attention to pronouncements from the pulpit.Â The threat to Austrian Christianity comes moreÂ from secularising indifference than from any rival religion.

economist,Oct 20th 2017,Quebecâ€™s ban on face-coverings risks inflaming inter-communal tensions," This is not the first time a Quebec government has played identity politics in a province whose political class professes to be secular but retains a lingering attachment to its deep Catholic roots. (There is still, for example, a crucifix in the National Assembly.) A previous government headed by the nationalist Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois (PQ) sparked a heated debate in 2013 when it proposed a charter of values banning any representative of authority from wearing what it called ostentatious religious symbols. Mr Couillard, who was then in opposition, accused the government of sowing division. Justin Trudeau, who is now Canada's prime minister but was head of the national Liberal opposition at the time, said the PQ government was trying to play divisive political games to distract from the provinceâ€™s poor economy. The proposal died when the PQ lost to the Liberals in the provincial election of 2014. Mr Trudeau has been much more cautious in his reaction to the law passed this week by fellow Liberals. He said there would be â€œa lot of reflectionsâ€ù on whether the law was constitutional, but it was not the federal governmentâ€™s job to mount such a challenge. The new law, which goes by the lengthy title â€œAn act to foster adherence to State religious neutrality and, in particular, to provide a framework for requests for accommodations on religious grounds in certain bodiesâ€ù, will indeed be challenged on constitutional grounds. If the federal government does not do this, then a civil-liberties group will. Emmett Macfarlane, a constitutional scholar, says the law violates the guarantees of freedom of religion and equality that are in the constitution. It is unlikely to survive a court challenge, he concludes. Charles Taylor and GÃ©rard Bouchard, two distinguished scholars who launched Quebecâ€™s debate on secularism with an influential report in 2008, were scathing about what they called the sloppy drafting of the new law. Mr Taylor, a Catholic who is a world authority on the history of secularism, called it a â€œdogâ€™s breakfastâ€ù. The election will be long past by the time any court challenge reaches its conclusion. It took seven years to settle a challenge to prayers being said before council meetings in Saguenay, Quebec. Further pushback to the new law is expected from the main provincial opposition parties, the PQ and the Coalition for the Future of Quebec. Unlike the civil-liberties groups, they both argue that the new law does not go far enough. They have mooted the idea of a ban on all headscarves (even those that leave the face exposed) for representatives of authority such as judges or prosecutors.Â  In trying to preserve the fiction that the law is even-handed, StÃ©phanie VallÃ©e, the justice minister, says it also applies to people who wear ski masks, scarves and sun-glasses. How to enforce this in a province where people routinely cover their faces during the harsh winter is a puzzle the government has not solved. In abandoning his previous stand for perceived political advantage, Mr Couillard runs the risk of stoking inter-communal tension and creating bafflement among those whose job it is to apply the law.

economist,Oct 15th 2017,"In Belgium, arguments about Islam grow louder"," In recent days, Belgiumâ€™s politicians have been focusing not on the smaller mosques thronged by migrants butÂ  on the capitalâ€™s oldest and grandest place of Muslim worship. Back in 1967, Belgiumâ€™s King Baudouin formally transferred to his Saudi counterpart King Faisal a piece ofÂ  prime property which later became the cityâ€™s Great Mosque and main Islamic Centre. This is where diplomats pray;Â  it is also the go-to place of instruction for people who are bent onÂ  embracing Islam (including Belgian men who plan to marry Muslim women) and want to study the religion before receiving a certificate. Awkwardly, a few of the thousands of people who have studied there went on to become terrorists. The investigative panel, representing politicians across the linguistic and ideological spectrum, has come up with a bold proposal: the Great Mosque should be removed from Saudi oversight and instead placed under a panel representing Belgian Islam as a whole. MeanwhileÂ  the countryâ€™s (Flemish) migration minister, Theo Francken, has declared his intention to expel the mosqueâ€™s main imam on grounds that he belongs to the puristÂ  Salafi school of Islam. (Its director was expelled in similar circumstances in 2012.) The Egyptian-trained imam, Abdelhadi Sewif, has indignantly denied any connection with extremism and appealed to the countryâ€™s highest migration authority.Â  Another sharp-tongued Flemish politician, Belgiumâ€™s deputy premier Jan Jambon, duly retorted that if the imamâ€™s appeal prevails, a fresh revocation of his permit will be decreed on different grounds and the end-result will be the same. One of Belgiumâ€™s best-read Islamic scholars, Yacob Mahi, says he is appalled by the expulsion order and insists it will do nothingÂ  to stamp out terrorism. As Mr Mahi argues, the Egyptian imam has never preached hatred or violence and, while theologically conservative, he is not a Salafi. Moreover even if the imam were a Salafi, that would not be ground for his expulsion, given that some forms of that back-to-basicsÂ  theology are quite eirenic: that is Mr Mahiâ€™s argument, and he has urged co-religionists to find peaceful and polite ways to complain about the impending move.Â  Â  Â  Elsewhere in Belgium, the authorities are more reliant than ever on deals with the governments of Morocco and Turkey to keep an eye on mosques and their members.Â  The Muslim Executive of Belgium, which advises the government on the generous subsidies that it gives to IslamicÂ  groups and teachers, is controlled by people close to Moroccan officialdom. Turkey sends imams to serve its Belgian kin. This sort of approach has its advantages for all three governments,Â  but it means that Belgiumâ€™s Muslims are not being allowed to develop a style and sensibility of their own. Lots of people, ranging from the parliamentary investigators to learned people like Mr Mahi, who holds a doctorate from a French university, say they wish there could be such a thing as Belgian Islam, firmly rooted in Europeâ€™s environment and culture.Â  Similar wishes are expressed in almost every European country which hosts large Muslim minorities. In a typical expression of this sentiment, the Socialist Belgian parliamentarian Willy Demeyer has said the Great Mosqueâ€™s present regime is an outdated throwback to the diplomatic deals of the sixties. â€œ Today, Muslims are present in every district of Belgium and the vast majority of them wish to live out their beliefs in peace â€“ it is to them that we should be handing over the most representative place of Belgian Islam....â€ù MaybeÂ  the trouble is that nobody in this land of misty canals, detective stories and linguistic ambivalence can predict what exactly a home-grown Belgian Islam would look like, and many do not want to take the risk of finding out.Â  PreviousQuebecâ€™s ban on face-coverings risks inflaming inter-communal tensionsNextA row over transgender rights erupts between Greeceâ€™s politicians and its clerics",https://www.economist.com/blogs/erasmus/2017/10/islam-and-belgium-0
economist,Oct 12th 2017,Trauma medicine has learned lessons from the battlefield," The best way to measure medicsâ€™ success in treating victims of mass incidents is â€œcritical mortalityâ€ù, the share of those admitted to hospital with life-threatening injuries who die. This is more meaningful than the ratio of fatalities to injuries, since different modes of attack cause wounds of different types and severity. A paper in 2012 co-authored by Christine Gaarder, a doctor involved in the response to the Oslo attacks, found that between 2001 and 2007 the typical critical-mortality rate after a terrorist attack was between 15% and 37%. So few of the victims of more recent attacks in rich countries have died in hospital that rates have been much lower. That has been true both for lone gunmen, as perpetrators so often are in America, and for Islamist terrorists using knives, bombs or vehicles, as recently in Europe. On June 3rd the driver and passengers of a hired van ran over pedestrians on London Bridge, then marauded through Borough Market, wielding knives. Kingâ€™s College Hospital (KCH) typically admits three or four people with stab wounds on a Saturday night. In the hour after the first victims arrived it received one every five minutes. Eight people died at the scene, but all 14 admitted to KCH survived. So did all 34 admitted elsewhere. â€œThe number of saves was truly remarkable,â€ù says Chris Moran, the clinical director for trauma for Englandâ€™s National Health Service (NHS). No one died in hospital after the Boston marathon bombings in 2013. There was just one death among the 20 Norwegians admitted to hospital after the attacks by Anders Breivik in 2011. Hospitals in Paris saved all but two of the patients admitted after gunmen and suicide-bombers injured more than 400 people and killed 130 on November 13th 2015. The response to Las Vegas has not yet been audited, but of the 104 admissions to the University Medical Centre of Southern Nevada (UMC), another trauma hospital, just four died. The improvement in critical mortality reflects the better treatment of trauma, in large part inspired by lessons learned on battlefields. In the second world war about 30% of wounded American soldiers died. In the Korean and Vietnam wars the share was about a fifth (see chart). By Iraq and Afghanistan it had fallen to less than a tenth. <img alt="""" class=""component-image__img blog-post-article-image blog-post-article-image__slim"" data-reactid=""481"" sizes=""(min-width: 600px) 640px, calc(100vw - 20px)"" src=""https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20171014_IRC857.png"" srcset=""//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/200-width/images/print-edition/20171014_IRC857.png 200w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/300-width/images/print-edition/20171014_IRC857.png 300w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/400-width/images/print-edition/20171014_IRC857.png 400w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/640-width/images/print-edition/20171014_IRC857.png 640w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/800-width/images/print-edition/20171014_IRC857.png 800w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/1000-width/images/print-edition/20171014_IRC857.png 1000w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/1200-width/images/print-edition/20171014_IRC857.png 1200w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/1280-width/images/print-edition/20171014_IRC857.png 1280w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/1600-width/images/print-edition/20171014_IRC857.png 1600w""/> The decline did not happen by chance, a report by the National Academy of Sciences concluded in 2016. Sturdier armour helped. But so did the â€œfocused empiricismâ€ù of military medical teams who made incremental improvements to their treatment of the wounded. Civilian medicine has since embraced both clinical procedures developed in wartime and that way of thinking. Higher survival rates are mostly not about decisions taken by individual doctors, says Malcolm Tunnicliff, the clinical director for emergency and acute medicine at KCH. â€œIt is the whole system that saves peopleâ€™s lives.â€ù That system was, until recently, deeply flawed. In 2010 Britainâ€™s National Audit Office (NAO), a government watchdog, published a report into trauma care noting that mortality rates in England had barely improved in two decades. Critically ill patients were brought to their nearest hospital, meaning few hospitals saw enough cases to gain expertise in urgent, complex and multiple injuries. During major incidents British hospitals were overwhelmed. Joshi George, a neurosurgeon, did his first shift as a junior doctor on August 15th 1998, when Republican terrorists detonated a bomb in Omagh, Northern Ireland, killing 29 people. He remembers the smell of burnt flesh and mortar oilâ€”and that â€œthere was really no set-up.â€ù The walking wounded took buses to the local hospital, filling beds needed for the critically ill. Communication between hospitals was poor, a failing also evident after the bombings in London on July 7th 2005. With phone networks jammed, medical students were sent running from site to site with messages on paper. After the NAO report the NHS restructured its trauma care around 27 expert hospitals. Critically injured patients now travel to expert hospitals even if that means passing a local hospital on the way. That has improved the odds of surviving everyday traumas such as car crashes. (Trauma causes one in ten deaths globally and in many countries is the commonest cause of death for under-45s.) The NHS estimates that the change has saved 300-500 lives a year. The Netherlands and Germany have adopted similar â€œhub and spokeâ€ù systems. Specialist trauma hospitals help save lives after major incidents. Partly this is because their doctors are more experienced. Between 30% and 50% of the critical injuries seen at KCH are from penetrative injuries, mostly knife attacks, often by gangs who inflict multiple wounds because they have learned how expert the hospital is in keeping their victims alive. It is also because these hospitals are central to citiesâ€™ major-incident plans. Londonâ€™s four main trauma hospitals (KCH, Royal London, St Georgeâ€™s and St Maryâ€™s) must be prepared to receive patients with â€œinjury severity scoresâ€ù above 15; that is, on the verge of death. They must be able to clear at least ten beds within two hours and halt elective surgery. On-call staff must be able to turn up within 30-60 minutes. Enough blood for two to four hours, and surgical kit for 12 hours, must always be available. Parisâ€™s plan blanc gives the city the power to commandeer 40 hospitals and 100,000 health-care professionals. The scale reflects Franceâ€™s disastrous response to a heatwave in 2003, when 15,000 people died. Israelâ€™s hospitals must plan for dealing with 120% of normal bed capacity in case of emergency, and be able to increase that to 150% in times of war. <img alt="""" class=""component-image__img blog-post-article-image"" data-reactid=""494"" sizes=""(min-width: 600px) 640px, calc(100vw - 20px)"" src=""https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20171014_IRP003_0.jpg"" srcset=""//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/200-width/images/print-edition/20171014_IRP003_0.jpg 200w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/300-width/images/print-edition/20171014_IRP003_0.jpg 300w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/400-width/images/print-edition/20171014_IRP003_0.jpg 400w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/640-width/images/print-edition/20171014_IRP003_0.jpg 640w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/800-width/images/print-edition/20171014_IRP003_0.jpg 800w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/1000-width/images/print-edition/20171014_IRP003_0.jpg 1000w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/1200-width/images/print-edition/20171014_IRP003_0.jpg 1200w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/1280-width/images/print-edition/20171014_IRP003_0.jpg 1280w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/1600-width/images/print-edition/20171014_IRP003_0.jpg 1600w""/>Rehearsing for the worst in Paris Emergency responses are regularly rehearsed. Medics at UMC carry out two large drills each year, and were briefed by doctors from Orlando after the Pulse nightclub shooting last year. A week before the attack on Westminster Bridge on March 22nd, in which an Islamist terrorist injured more than 50 pedestrians and killed four by driving into them, as well as stabbing a police officer to death, Londonâ€™s doctors had done a run-through. Hours before the November 2015 Paris attacks the cityâ€™s doctors had practised their response to a mass shooting. Duncan Bew, the clinical director for trauma and acute surgery at KCH, is fond of the saying about no plan surviving first contact with the enemy. But planning and practice build in a â€œreflexâ€ù, he says, aiding medics to improvise when events do not go as rehearsed. The medical response begins at the scene. The first ambulance arrived at London Bridge three minutes after the van attack was reported, as the stabbings continued in Borough Market. A three-day rampage by gunmen in Mumbai in 2008 had alerted European police forces to the need to plan for cordons to protect paramedics, says Cressida Dick, the head of Londonâ€™s Metropolitan Police. On June 3rd the London Ambulance Service and the Met demarcated unsafe â€œhotâ€ù zones from â€œcoldâ€ù zones, where paramedics treated patients and set up casualty-clearing stations to dispatch them to hospitals. After a mass incident patients must quickly be triaged according to the severity of their injuries: P1, life-threatening; P2, serious; and P3, walking wounded. (P4 is dead.) The priority of medics on the scene is to get P1s to hospital alive. Labelling a P1 patient as P3 is of course dangerous but â€œover-triageâ€ù is also associated with higher mortality, since it can clog up wards. Stopping heavy bleeding is crucial. Blood loss is the cause of 30-40% of deaths from trauma. Yet until around a decade ago tourniquets were not routinely used. Poorly applied they can destroy nerves or limbs. But going without is usually more dangerous. Between 2005 and 2011 in Iraq and Afghanistan tourniquets, including new versions that clamp big, hard-to-find vessels such as the femoral artery, which is buried deep in the pelvis, saved up to 2,000 American lives, according to the National Academy of Sciences. Simple steps can ensure that tourniquets are not left on too long. British soldiers write â€œTâ€ù on the forehead of anyone receiving one, so doctors are reminded to remove it. Tourniquets are now commonplace in civilian medicine, as are haemostatic powders that clot blood. But there are not always enough. After Parisian medics used their belts as improvised tourniquets, many arrived at the hospital with their trousers falling down. Precious moments Another lesson from military medicine is to do the minimum to keep people alive, then get them to a specialist hospital as soon as possible. In the Vietnam war it took on average 45 days for a critically injured soldier to reach America. From Afghanistan and Iraq it took four. One soldier injured by a mortar attack in Balad, Iraq, was moved from the blast site to a field hospital, then to Germany, and finally to Virginia, all in under 36 hours. Speed saved lives in Paris and London, too. The first two patients to arrive at hospital from the 2015 Paris attacks did so by taxi. They did not even realise they had been shot. Police officers took two colleagues hit by the van on London Bridge to St Thomasâ€™ Hospital nearby using a makeshift stretcher. After they had been stabilised they were taken to KCH. Without this â€œscoop and runâ€ù both would have died. In the minutes before patients arrive doctors prepare for the surge. As the London Bridge incident unfolded, KCH set up its command structure. Switchboard operators alerted on-call staff, though most found out an attack was under way via Twitter or WhatsApp and set out unprompted. When they arrived at KCH they received a one-page â€œflash cardâ€ù explaining their role. Senior doctors check supplies. Whole blood containing plasma, platelets and red blood cells is readied. Recent research has shown that transfusing this mixture rather than individual components improves survival rates. Some incidents require specific equipment. On his drive to KCH as fire engulfed Grenfell Tower in London on June 14th, Dr Tunnicliff told procurement teams to grab kits for cyanide poisoning, since this is caused by inhaling fumes from burnt upholstery. Once a major incident has been declared, medics may take a moment to steel themselves. An anaesthetist working the night shift on May 22nd, when a homemade bomb placed by an Islamist terrorist in the Manchester Arena injured 250 people and killed 22, many of them children, says he tried to visualise what was coming, like a sportsman before a match. That helped, a little. The extent of the shrapnel injuries meant that several staff were crying as they operated on the injured girls. Faster than a speeding bullet As the surge begins doctors perform another triage, usually at the entrance of the resuscitation room. Patients may have deteriorated, especially if they have spent a long time waiting in the hot zone. Others may later decline in hospital. On June 3rd one patient brought to KCH from the London Bridge attack had been assessed as P3; despite being stabbed in the back of the head he was walking around. But soon enough he was reassessed as P1 because of a blood clot and whisked to theatre. Once inside the resuscitation room Dr Bew started logging patientsâ€™ details in a notebook. In Paris patients were tagged with barcodes denoting their triage status. But keeping tabs on patients is more rudimentary in the NHS. As it is in Las Vegas: doctors in Sunrise wrote patientsâ€™ triage status and details of their injuries directly onto them. Doctors are trying to make sure patients do not need to return to the resuscitation room. That requires senior doctors to treat individual patients at the same time as keeping tabs on what is happening in the rest of the room. At KCH, every 15 minutes the clinical directors shouted out situation reports. Radiology is often a bottleneck en route to the intensive care unit (ICU) or operating room. So hospitals are bringing scanning equipment closer to it. X-rays reveal lungs collapsed from stab wounds; whole-body CT scans pick up the internal injuries from blast wounds. Bullets and shrapnel burrow into odd places. Twenty years ago trauma doctors would â€œstay and playâ€ù, notes John Holcomb, a trauma surgeon and professor at the University of Texas. Now, rather than do everything a patient needs in one go, surgeons will do the minimum necessary to save life and move on to the next case. After the Paris attacks the first patient admitted to HÃ´pital Saint Louis spent just 30 minutes on the operating table. Surgeons removed two bullets from his abdomen and cut out 60cm of his intestine. They left three less life-threatening bullets to be removed later, and sent him to the ICU. This â€œdamage controlâ€ù approach is inspired by the armed forces. In emergencies surgeons at Camp Bastion, the British base in Afghanistan, aimed not to operate on any patient for more than an hour. <img alt="""" class=""component-image__img blog-post-article-image"" data-reactid=""513"" sizes=""(min-width: 600px) 640px, calc(100vw - 20px)"" src=""https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20171014_IRP002_0.jpg"" srcset=""//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/200-width/images/print-edition/20171014_IRP002_0.jpg 200w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/300-width/images/print-edition/20171014_IRP002_0.jpg 300w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/400-width/images/print-edition/20171014_IRP002_0.jpg 400w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/640-width/images/print-edition/20171014_IRP002_0.jpg 640w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/800-width/images/print-edition/20171014_IRP002_0.jpg 800w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/1000-width/images/print-edition/20171014_IRP002_0.jpg 1000w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/1200-width/images/print-edition/20171014_IRP002_0.jpg 1200w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/1280-width/images/print-edition/20171014_IRP002_0.jpg 1280w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/1600-width/images/print-edition/20171014_IRP002_0.jpg 1600w""/>Heroes run towards danger Most surgery has become highly specialised. â€œEven brain surgeons canâ€™t operate on every part of the brain,â€ù says Dr George. But trauma requires surgeons to operate across anatomical boundaries under extreme pressure. After the London Bridge attack doctors at KCH performed more than a dozen chest drains and â€œclam-shellâ€ù thoracotomies, where the chest is cut open in an arc beneath the rib cage. Surgeons tied severed bowels and clamped vessels. They cleaned wounds thoroughly, fearful of contamination when the same knife is used on multiple people. But they did not linger. Trauma medicine is not for perfectionists or mavericks. Teamwork is essential. One surgeon at KCH recalls draining a patientâ€™s chest at the same time as cardiac, vascular and facial surgeons were operating. In Las Vegasâ€™s hospitals, surgeons rushed to deal with the carnage wrought by semi-automatic weapons. Bodies were littered with bullets. Some had entered at odd, multiple angles as people crouched in an attempt to protect themselves. After the surge subsides, hospitals try to return to their normal schedule as soon as possible. But a major incident can be declared over too soon. Some hospitals in Manchester restarted elective surgeries a few hours after the bombing. Yet in the following ten days the injured required 139 hours of additional theatre timeâ€”about two normal weeksâ€™ worth of surgery. Saving more lives means a greater need for rehabilitation, both physical and psychological. Trauma hospitals are increasingly bringing physiotherapists and rehab doctors onto ICU rounds rather than referring patients later. In Paris a 35-strong team of psychiatrists and psychologists was called up as part of plan blanc. In Manchester a dedicated â€œbereavement serviceâ€ù counselled the parents of victims. It is not just patients who need psychological support. One doctor involved in the Manchester attacks still hears the voices of injured parents who awoke screaming for lost children. In the resuscitation room after the Grenfell fire staff had allowed critically ill patients to use phones to speak to trapped loved ones for the last time. Hospitals such as KCH are using a peer-to-peer counselling method used by the British army for post-traumatic stress. Each major incident is followed by efforts to learn lessons from how it played out. Professor Moran has overseen debriefs for the Westminster, Manchester and London Bridge attacks. It is vital, Dr Bew says, for trauma doctors to admit their mistakes and for hospitals to have an open and honest attitude towards error. All of which will help trauma teams to keep improving. They will need to. The treatment of victims of terrorism has been transformed by lessons learned by trying to save injured soldiers. But as the attack in Las Vegas shows, those seeking to harm civilians will continue to test those who deal with the aftermath.

economist,Oct 28th 2017,Silicon speculators," Their business model leaves AWMs with a problem. To make a profit despite low fees, they must attract lots of client money. Michael Wong, an analyst at Morningstar, an investment research firm, estimates that, depending on its model, an AWM would need between $16bn and $40bn to cover its costs. No independent AWMs have reached profitability, though some are close. Betterment says it has $11bn under management. But for most AWMs, profitability remains distant. Only a few manage over $1bn or have more than 100,000 clients. To get more clients, many are tying up with established wealth managers. On October 5th Aviva, a British insurer, said it would buy a majority stake in Wealthify. Michelle Pearce, Wealthifyâ€™s co-founder and chief investment officer, noted that Aviva has 15m customers in Britain, who can use her firmâ€™s services through Avivaâ€™s portal. To stay independent, AWMs need to get big quickly, in part by seeking customers established firms neglect. Similarly, acquired AWMs often pitch their products to people their parent firms would not otherwise serve. These customers tend to have little wealth and to be new investors. There are dangers in this: they may place too much faith in AWMsâ€™ more optimistic projections of future riches. Wealthfront even allows customers to borrow at 3.5-4.75% against the value of their savings without selling off their portfolios and disrupting their investment strategies. Like their human counterparts, robos may have a tendency to oversell their investing prowess.

economist,Oct 28th 2017,Millennials are doing better than the baby-boomers did at their age," Todayâ€™s youngsters may resent having to provide for more pensioners, not least because they feel that older generations have it easier than them. The OECD provides qualified support for this complaint.

Comparing generations at a similar stage of life paints a different picture. Todayâ€™s young adults have a significantly higher disposable income than previous generations had at the same age. OECD citizens now in their early 30s have 7% more than members of Generation X had at that age and over 40% more than boomers enjoyed when they were similarly short in the tooth (see chart). Youngsters may sigh with impatience when an old codger tells them how life was tougher â€œwhen I was your ageâ€ù. But it was. This millennial privilege is, however, smaller in America, which tends to set the tone for the generation wars. (Indeed Americans in their early 30s are slightly worse off than the preceding generation was at a similar age.) The gap also appears to close as the later generations get older. Gen-Xers were far more comfortable in their 30s than the people born a decade or two before them. But now they are in their 40s, their incomes have stopped rising, whereas their seniors enjoyed strong gains at the same age. This may reflect the lingering influence of the global financial crisis. But if this trajectory persists, a time may soon come when old folk sigh with impatience as youngsters tell them how much easier life was â€œwhen you were my ageâ€ù.

economist,Oct 28th 2017,India recapitalises its state-owned banks," Details of the bail-out scheme are pending, but may resemble a rescue plan in the 1990s, whereby banks financed â€œrecapitalisation bondsâ€ù issued by the government. The proceeds were used to subscribe to banksâ€™ rights issues. (Banks will have to raise 580bn rupees themselves, perhaps by selling non-core assets, and receive a further 180bn rupees from government coffers left over from a previous scheme.) One attraction is that the money the government will have to borrow, roughly 1% of GDP, will not be reflected in its deficit, saving the finance ministryâ€™s blushes. The prospect of fresh funds sent most state-owned banksâ€™ share prices soaring by well over 25%. Unlike recent Indian bank-rescue schemes, the package is large enough to make a difference. It should allow banks to lend again, if they can find willing borrowers. Indian businesses have plenty of spare capacity and many are still over-indebted. Some are still dealing with the effects of a sudden â€œdemonetisationâ€ù of the economy last November, which has dented output. The complex implementation of a new goods-and-services tax in July has also frayed corporate confidence. The government also says its banks will be run more efficiently, to prevent further incontinent lending. There is reason to doubt that. Reform of their corporate governance is long overdue; and letting the private sector take over the reins at public banks remains taboo. Still, repair of the balance-sheets is at last under way.

economist,Oct 28th 2017,Firms should make more information about salaries public," Transparency might threaten the function of capitalist economies if people were implacably opposed to pay gaps, but they are not. A study published in 2015 of factory workers in India, for instance, found that unequal pay worsened morale and led to reduced effort when workers could not see othersâ€™ contributions, but not when productivity differences were easily observable. Yet in the modern economy, individual contributions are often devilishly hard to assess. Simple theory suggests that workers are paid according to their productivity. Were they to earn more, their employers would lose money; were they to earn less, other firms could profit by hiring away underpaid employees. But although it is easy enough to see how many shirts a textile worker stitches in an hour, it is much harder to evaluate the contribution of one member of a team that has spent years developing new software. When it is difficult to observe important parts of a job, economists believe that trying to link pay closely to narrow measures of performance can be misguided. Workers inevitably neglect murky but critical tasks in favour of those the boss can easily quantify. In the knowledge economy, therefore, the relationship between pay and productivity is often loose. Pay gaps are often nonetheless justified. Workers with scarce and valuable skills can easily threaten to leave, and can therefore bargain for higher pay. Those fat pay-packets serve the economy by encouraging young workers to develop skills that are in short supplyâ€”provided, of course, that they know how much they can expect to earn. But the difficulty in observing productivity allows factors to influence pay, such as office politics, discrimination or a simple tendency to silence the squeakiest wheels with grease. Open-plan offices Not every country will opt for radical transparency. Even Nordic governments continue to tweak their policies: in 2014 Norway banned anonymous searching of its tax database, so citizens could see who had nosed around their finances. But increased openness about pay could improve both the fairness and the functioning of the economy. When pay is public, it is not the justifiable inequities that create the most discomfort, but those firms cannot defend.

MasterCardâ€™s market capitalisation is twice that of American Express; Visaâ€™s, three times as big. PayPal, spun off from eBay in 2015 and run by a former American Express executive, has a tiny fraction of Amexâ€™s revenues and profits but on the eve of the earnings announcement passed it in market value (see chart). Its sales and profits have grown much faster, and it was born online. Rather than a card, PayPal provides a payments platform for individuals, on smartphones or computers, using accounts at their bank or tied to American Express, Visa or MasterCard. In the process it collects a fee. It also offers systems such as Venmo (intended for payments between individuals but sometimes used by businesses, too), Braintree, a financial link used by Uber and Airbnb, and Xoom, a remittance service. Competition abroad is just as keen. American Express entered Asia early and once had an enviable position there, but its presence has faded. In 2007 it sold (to Standard Chartered) a private bank created almost a century ago that had languished from inattention. Japanâ€™s JCB has issued almost as many cards (but still accounts for far less in transactions). Chinaâ€™s UnionPay boasts the worldâ€™s biggest transaction volume, eight times that of American Express, and 55% of cards issued globally. These conventional competitors may matter less than electronic networks such as Alibabaâ€™s Alipay and Tencentâ€™s Tenpay and a profusion of still little-known startups. The entire mechanics of payments are being rethought, with cards being replaced by QR codes, biometrics and more. In this noisy hothouse, Mr Chenault deserves respect for keeping American Express healthy. It has supported its market share through deals with banks and other financial institutions that can now issue American Express cards (and generate fees by transacting through Amexâ€™s systems). In the past decade the number of businesses accepting its cards has doubled. But these victories have come at a cost. Twenty-five years ago American Express collected a 3.2% fee on every transaction, according to Sanford Bernstein, an investment research firm. Now, it makes less than 1.8%. Competitive pressure will squeeze this further. In the past, merchants were willing to pay for American Express transactions because its cardholders were well-off and willing to spend. But now large banks are going after these customers. JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, both with card businesses headed by ex-Amexers, have issued cards that provide benefits broadly regarded as better than those from American Express. Soon Bank of America will follow. Banks have also taken aim at lucrative co-branding deals carrying exclusive rewards for customers. In 2015 American Express lost one such deal with Costco, a large retailer that accounted for 10% of its transaction volume, to Citigroup. Another, with JetBlue, an airline, went to Barclays. To rely less on revenue from transaction fees, American Express has become more banklike, lending more. Net interest income made up 18% of revenues in 2012 and should bring in 28% in 2018, predicts Nomura/Instinet, a brokerage. That has looked good lately, because funds have been cheap and credit quality high, but the environment may be changing. Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase, among others, began expanding their consumer-loan portfolios in 2015. Now quality may be worsening. In the two most recent quarters, analysts were surprised by the size of American Expressâ€™s provisions for credit losses. Other banks also increased provisions. Credit is cyclical and it would be a surprise if this time were different. A new concern is electronic fraud, notwithstanding companiesâ€™ efforts to thwart it. Still, the business that American Express joined 60 years ago will continue to grow, and American Express may well be a beneficiary. But others may be better placed. Mr Chenaultâ€™s tenure may thus be remembered merely as a pause before the end of an era.

economist,Oct 28th 2017,Apple should shrink its finance arm before it goes bananas," Apple Capital is different from these firms in important ways. It does not take deposits and has much lower leverage. In their prime Goldman and GE Capital were run by hard-charging financiers, and made lots of loans. By contrast, Apple Capital does not make loans, and is not meant to be a profit centre in its own right. Nonetheless, it has become riskier, in three ways. First, Apple Capital is investing in racier assets, which involves taking credit risk. In 2011 a majority of its assets were â€œrisk-freeâ€ù: cash or government bonds. Today 68% are invested in other kinds of securities, mainly corporate bonds, which Apple says are generally investment grade. The shift may explain why Appleâ€™s annual interest rate earned on its portfolio (2%) is now higher than that of the four other Silicon Valley firms with money mountains, Microsoft, Alphabet, Cisco and Oracle. In total, they still have 66% of their portfolios squirrelled away in risk-free assets. Second, Appleâ€™s derivatives book has got much bigger. Since 2011 its notional sizeâ€”the face value of its contractsâ€”has risen by 425%, to $124bn. This is still much smaller than big banksâ€™ positions, but is the third-largest book of any non-financial firm in America, after GE and Ford. For every dollar of foreign sales, Apple has 89 cents of derivatives, compared with 57 cents for the other four tech giants. At points these derivatives have yielded big rewards. In 2015 they contributed $4bn, or 6% of Appleâ€™s profits. But they have dangers, too. Apple says that its â€œvalue-at-riskâ€ù (VAR), a statistical measure of the maximum likely loss in an average day, is $434m. That is huge: similar to the combined VAR of the worldâ€™s top ten investment banks. In theory losses on derivatives would be offset by gains in the value of Appleâ€™s underlying business. But the sheer size of these positions gives pause for thought. The last area of higher risk is Appleâ€™s divided geography. Its foreign operation swims in cash while its domestic one drowns in debt. Profits made abroad are kept in foreign subsidiaries. That way Apple does not pay the 35% levy America charges when earnings are repatriated. Some 94% of Apple Capitalâ€™s assets are â€œoffshoreâ€ù and cannot be tapped for ordinary purposes. The domestic business must do the hard work of paying for dividends and buy-backs. Its profits are not big enough to cover these, so it borrows. Domestic net debts have risen to $92bn, or five times domestic gross operating profits. Each year Apple must issue $30bn of bonds (including refinancing), similar to the average of Wall Streetâ€™s five largest firms. Appleâ€™s core business is so profitable that it isâ€”almostâ€”inconceivable that a blow-up at Apple Capital could lead to it needing taxpayer or central-bank support, as was the case for GM and GE. Still, it is easy to imagine how Apple Capital could hurt its parent. A market shock could lead to losses on its portfolios. A two-percentage-point rise in interest rates would result in a loss of $10bn. If bond markets dried up, Apple might struggle to issue so much debt and have to bring home funds, incurring a big tax bill. It might also become tricky to run such a big derivatives portfolio. Donâ€™t upset the Apple cart Apple Capital has grown in a forgiving period for financial markets. That wonâ€™t last. Over time, the risk of mission creep will rise, as will the temptation to invest in riskier assets. On the current trajectory, by 2022 its assets will reach $400bn and debts $250bn. By then financial regulators, who do not supervise Apple, will be grinding their teeth at night. According to a former manager who left in 2012, Appleâ€™s financial gurus were careful because â€œnobody wanted that 3am call from Steve Jobsâ€ù. But Jobs isnâ€™t there any more. In any case, a fear of rebuke is not enough. If the tax laws change Tim Cook, Appleâ€™s boss should wind down the structure that the firm has created. But even if the rules donâ€™t Apple Capital should be shrunk. Tech firms should seek to disrupt finance, not be seduced by it.

economist,Oct 26th 2017,Will corporate tax cuts boost workersâ€™ wages?," Paul Krugman and Brad DeLong, two left-wing economists, have fired back their own Greek and graphs, laced with snark. But Messrs Mankiw and Mulligan showed that the CEAâ€™s prediction is at least logically possible. That does not mean it is reasonable. There are three reasons to doubt it. First, to calculate its figures, the White House relied on two studies, neither from a peer-reviewed journal, of how wages have varied with corporate-tax rates internationally and across American states. A recent review of such papers, by Jane Gravelle of the Congressional Research Service, found both to be statistically flawed. In any case, Mihir Desai of Harvard Business School, who co-wrote one of them, says that the CEA misinterpreted his work. If you assumed the corporate tax creates a deadweight loss worth ten times the revenue it raises, you might justify the CEAâ€™s numbers, he says. But that is implausible. (As The Economist went to press, the CEA was preparing a second report using other methods to justify the figures.) Second, the American economy is plainly not small. This makes capital less flighty. And although it may have become more mobile because of globalisation, many investment opportunities in Americaâ€”in Silicon Valley, sayâ€”are hard to replicate elsewhere. This also makes a high corporate-tax rate less likely to send investment abroad. Third, the White Houseâ€™s analysis ignores other features of the Republican tax plan, like a proposal to switch to a â€œterritorialâ€ù corporate-tax system. Because this would stop taxing the foreign profits of American firms, it might actually encourage investment abroad. And if, as is likely, the tax cut is financed by borrowing, it is likely to push up interest rates and the dollar. That would create an economic drag. <img alt="""" class=""component-image__img blog-post-article-image blog-post-article-image__slim"" data-reactid=""486"" sizes=""(min-width: 600px) 640px, calc(100vw - 20px)"" src=""https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20171028_FNC058.png"" srcset=""//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/200-width/images/print-edition/20171028_FNC058.png 200w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/300-width/images/print-edition/20171028_FNC058.png 300w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/400-width/images/print-edition/20171028_FNC058.png 400w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/640-width/images/print-edition/20171028_FNC058.png 640w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/800-width/images/print-edition/20171028_FNC058.png 800w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/1000-width/images/print-edition/20171028_FNC058.png 1000w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/1200-width/images/print-edition/20171028_FNC058.png 1200w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/1280-width/images/print-edition/20171028_FNC058.png 1280w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/1600-width/images/print-edition/20171028_FNC058.png 1600w""/> The White House has rushed to include the CEAâ€™s paper in its argument for tax cuts. Yet the estimate is more than a little optimistic. There is no clear relationship between recent corporate-tax cuts and wage growth in rich countries (see chart). Even the Tax Foundation, a think-tank that looks favourably on corporate-tax cuts, predicts a much smaller wage boost. Should Republicans get their way, Americans can expect a pay riseâ€”just not a bumper one.

economist,Oct 26th 2017,Reports of the MBAâ€™s demise are exaggerated," Demand has, it is true, fallen at smaller American schools. Those with fewer than 200 students saw applications drop by 6% this year. These schools enroll around half of all students in America. But they face distinct pressures. One is Donald Trump. In a survey by Carrington Crisp, a consultancy, around 40% of potential applicants said that the new president had discouraged them from studying in the country (just 3% said he made them more likely to study there). His anti-immigrant administrationâ€™s plans to tighten the rules for graduate work visas may have something to do with this. â€œInternational students are feeling left behind,â€ù explains one who opted to study in France over America. Dislike of Trumpism will not deter applicants from the finest American establishments. Few institutions anywhere can match the cachet of Harvard, Wharton or Kellogg, which charge a premium as a result. Second-tier American programmes are nearly as expensive, but nothing like as prestigious. Foreign students may opt for cheaper courses in countries with brighter job prospects. That bodes well for non-American MBAs. One partial exception is Britain. British schools lure students from the European Union, in part because they enjoy an automatic right to work at Londonâ€™s big banks and professional-services firms. Brexit would change that. But British courses are at least getting cheaper for non-Brits. The collapse in the pound since the Brexit vote in June 2016 has cut the cost to Europeans of attending London Business School by â‚¬14,000 ($16,000), for instance. That may help explain why three in four British schools report a rise in applications this year, according to GMAC. If Britain crashes out of the EU the pound could weaken again, making courses look cheaper still. By then, however, the discount may not be sufficient to attract anyone.

economist,Oct 26th 2017,Italyâ€™s fourth-biggest bank returns to the stockmarket," The scheme is rounded off by the bankâ€™s restructuring. This includes simplifying and digitising retail banking, strengthening the wealth-management business and improving credit-risk management. The number of branches will be cut from 2,000 to 1,400; 350 have already closed. Monte dei Paschiâ€™s headcount of 25,500 will be reduced by 5,500; 1,800 staff have already departed. In August Marco Morelli, the bankâ€™s boss, sent an e-mail to all staff asking for ideas. He received 1,000 replies. He then spent two weeks touring the country, meeting staff in several cities. At each encounter Mr Morelli projected onto a screen three of the most critical e-mailed responses. The message he sought to transmit: no more alibis. Things may be looking up. Pavilion, an investment services firm, suggests that new regulation and accounting rules will make life harder for Italian banks dealing with bad loans, but cyclical factors will offset this. In August net non-performing loans fell to â‚¬65.3bn, down from â‚¬86.8bn in December, according to Italyâ€™s banking association. UniCredit, the countryâ€™s biggest lender, announced preliminary third-quarter earnings on October 24th: pre-tax profits rose by 45%, year on year, helped by the sale of Pioneer, a fund manager. But the Sienese lender has a lot of work to do. Its gross non-performing exposure ratio is projected to fall from 34.5% in December 2016 to 12.9% within five years. That is a little below last Decemberâ€™s Italian average, but still much higher than the European average of 5.1%.

economist,Oct 26th 2017,Sauce for a Brussels goose," However, when it comes to calculating the contributions of employees, the EU uses a completely different approach. As a Eurostat document shows*, the discount rate in these numbers is a 22-year average of real government-bond yields. This includes the period from 1995 to 2000, when real rates were often 4% or higher. The result is a nominal discount rate of 4.8% and a real rate of 3.1%. Up until 2012, the EU used a 12-year average of bond yields. But it is steadily moving to a 30-year average by 2021, which means that those high real yields from the late 1990s will stay in the numbers for longer. The remarkable result is that while the discount rate in the balance-sheet calculations has been falling, the discount rate used for the contribution of officials rose in 2016. The good news for employees is that they were required to contribute 0.5% less of their salaries than would otherwise have been the case. Had the EU used the discount rate it applied to its balance-sheet to calculate the size of contributions, its officials would have had to stump up a lot moreâ€”resulting in significant cuts in take-home pay. So it is understandable that it has softened the blow. But Britain is surely at liberty to argue that what is sauce for EU bureaucrats ought to be sauce for British taxpayers as well. Bruegel, a think-tank in Brussels, concluded that, if this more generous discount rate were used, the British pensions bill would fall by between a third and more than half. In cash, that could be â‚¬2.5bn-4bn. All Britain has to do, then, is argue this case. But EU negotiators might ask how Britain calculates the pension liability for its own public servants. Unfortunately, the accounts of the England and Wales teachersâ€™ pension scheme show a real discount rate of just 0.24%. That would undermine the logic of the British argument. Another approach might be for Britain simply to pay its share of the pensions bill every year; after all, that is what the EU does at the moment. Then Britain would not be â€œpunishedâ€ù by the use of a historically low discount rate. But the snag would be that Britain could still be paying out for some bureaucrats in the 2070s, creating the kind of festering sore that the countryâ€™s tabloids will complain about for decades (and demand that some future government repudiates). Perhaps some cunning British civil servant has found a way of escaping this dilemma. When Buttonwood contacted the Department for Exiting the EU (DEXEU), he was told it was a matter for the Treasury; the Treasury said it was a matter for DEXEU. There was no news on whether either department planned to hold its Christmas party in a brewery. * â€œPension Scheme of EU Officials (PSEO): Actuarial assumptions used in the 2017 assessmentâ€ù.

Aldi plans to open 900 swanky new stores in America, putting it third in the country by store count, behind Walmart and Kroger. (Lidl has just begun operating in America, and aims to have 100 stores within the year.) Mr Rueschoff bristles at any suggestion that Aldi is changing too much. The new stores still sell only about 1,400 items, as opposed to the 50,000 or so on many rivalsâ€™ shelves, enabling big economies of scale. At Lidl, a new generation of senior managers last year began to upgrade their stores in a similar way. They resigned in February after their effort to expand Lidlâ€™s small online offering was deemed too radical a departure from the discounterâ€™s original, tight-fisted formula. But the idea that opening revamped stores as rapidly as possible is the best way to win market share, as well as make money, remains. The discounters reason that whereas their conventional rivals, such as Sainsburyâ€™s, might be able to win some customers online, they will not make much money out of it. Take Britain, one of the most advanced places in the world for e-commerce. Britons buy 7.3% of their groceries online, up from 6.7% a year ago, second only to South Koreans. Tesco, Sainsburyâ€™s and others have spent hundreds of millions of pounds on sophisticated internet operations. Yet, as Bryan Roberts, an analyst at TCC Global, a consultancy, argues, these stores are merely â€œcannibalising themselvesâ€ù, driving most of their shoppers from their most profitable channel (the store) to the least profitable (online). Operating margins in the supermarket business are notoriously low, but even lower online, says Mr Robertsâ€”about 3% versus 0.5% or less. Fleets of vans and drivers are expensive, but, argues Walter Blackwood, a consultant, supermarkets dare not charge cost price (or more) for the service as customers expect it to be virtually free. He attributes this in part to the baleful effect of the online behemoth Amazon, which does not seek to profit from the actual delivery of goods, thus creating the conviction that deliveries should be free. Customers expect the same from everybody else. For the moment, Aldiâ€™s decision to spend its money on physical stores is working. In less developed e-commerce markets, like America, they may have even more of an advantage. But the proportion of people shopping online can only go one way, so the strategy carries risks. Supermarkets are learning to make online sales more profitable, through â€œclick and collectâ€ù schemes, for example, or raising the minimum transaction value for deliveries. A decisive clash of competing retail philosophies looms. To the victor, arugula. To the loser, turnips.

economist,Oct 26th 2017,The Cambodian government threatens labour rights," Â This time the government decided to quash dissent pre-emptively. In the past 18 months it has rammed through new laws to stifle independent labour movements. It has become harder to register unions, and only those approved by the government can represent their members in the most important disputes. Another proposed law would see labour cases handled by newly created labour courts, rather than special councils as happens now. The councillors are government appointees, but have earned respect for their efforts to ground rulings in law; unions and activists prefer them to judges and prosecutors, who are regarded as less independent and more arbitrary. All this hits garment workers hard; theirs is the countryâ€™s biggest industry, and heavily unionised. It also troubles international apparel firms. â€œThe government is taking all the predictability out of the business,â€ù says Sarah Hopkins, a manager in Cambodia for H&amp;M. Rival brands such as Gap, H&amp;M and Zara (owned by Spainâ€™s Inditex) have jointly lobbied the government to relax its tightening grip of labour. Most say they are trying to improve conditions at suppliersâ€™ factories through strict standards and unannounced inspections. Some employers provide workers with health care, free eye checks, even libraries. Not everyone is as scrupulous. The manager of a Cambodian knitwear factory confesses that its Hong-Kongese owner just wants business â€œto go smoothâ€ù. And Mr Hun Sen has turned more anti-Western after an old video emerged in which the opposition leader says he took American advice on how best to run a party (he awaits trial on treason charges). Activists point out that, if the fashion titans wanted to help in a big way, they should cut out the middlemen by acquiring the sewing mills and turning them into subsidiaries. But such investments are unappealing to modern firms, which focus on design rather than production. In the meantime, no one will add capacity until after the election, reckons Ken Loo, head of the Garment Manufacturers Association in Cambodia, an industry body. Undermining workersâ€™ rights, Mr Hun Sen may find, is no longer the best way to woo foreign business.

economist,Oct 26th 2017,Indiaâ€™s new aviation policies are breathing life into a once-ailing sector," But the real test is yet to come. Having bought 25 Bombardier turboprops for its larger UDAN routes, this month SpiceJet put out feelers for an order of over 100 tiny Quest Kodiaks. They can land on water, gravel and grass, says Ajay Singh, the carrierâ€™s chairman, and thereby reach even the most-remote communities. As a social equaliser, the single-propeller plane has clear appeal. But as a vehicle for low-cost transportation, it is a poor solution. High per-passenger costs on seldom-used routes will force Mr Modi to draw the line somewhere. Inevitably, he will conclude that not every commoner deserves the gift of flight. UDANâ€™s egalitarian ideals have already left some disappointed. Air Odisha and Air Deccan won more than half of the designations in the first round by bidding for the very lowest-capacity routes. But neither airline has yet flown a single flight on that network. Slot constraints in Delhi are partly to blame. The suspicion is that financial viability may also be a factor. Nevertheless, there is more good news than bad. In two years, Indiaâ€™s government has introduced a complex and socially beneficial scheme. It is also privatising Air India, the countryâ€™s loss-making flag-carrier, which was being propped up at the taxpayerâ€™s expense. Moreover, the government has begun chipping away at over-regulation. It removed foreign-ownership restrictions on domestic airlines. And it diluted rules that stopped Indian carriers from flying internationally until they reached five years of age and had a 20-plane fleet. With domestic traffic growing by more than 20% a year and 97% of the population still not flying, Indiaâ€™s airlines have every reason to be optimistic. Donâ€™t stop now, Mr Modi.

economist,Oct 26th 2017,The European Central Bank starts its exit from quantitative easing," Mr Draghi faced two related constraints. Hawks on the ECBâ€™s Governing Council, many of whom opposed QE in the first instance, have long been pushing for it to be unwound. And according to the ECBâ€™s self-imposed rules for QEâ€”it purchases the sovereign bonds of euro-zone countries in proportion to their economic sizeâ€”it would soon have run out of bonds to buy. Although Mr Draghi remained coy on the composition of the reduced purchases, saying it had not been discussed, markets expect him to cut the purchases of sovereign bonds by more than those of corporate debt. Policy remains super-easy: the ECB will still be buying. And Mr Draghi struck a doveish note by emphasising two other elements of the ECBâ€™s decision. First, the central bank will reinvest the proceeds from maturing bonds. Its vice-president, Vitor ConstÃ¢ncio, said this would amount to â€œbillionsâ€ù monthly. (The bank promised to start publishing information on these redemptions monthly, starting on November 6th.) Second, it committed itself to keeping rates low well beyond the end of QE (its main refinancing rate is zero and its deposit rate negative). Mr Draghi has heralded the most gradual of exits from QE, and it seems that markets have understood that. Yet he is not yet off the hook. As QE unwinds, he will still have to take care to avoid tantrums in future.",https://www.economist.com/news/business-and-finance/21730753-gradual-reduction-qe-provokes-no-tantrums-european-central-bank-starts-its
economist,Oct 26th 2017,Fears that Xi Jinping is bad for private enterprise are overblown," Take the clampdown on moguls. Regulators have chosen four of Chinaâ€™s most acquisitive companies for extra scrutiny: Anbang, an insurance firm; HNA, an aviation-to-tourism group; Wanda, a property developer; and Fosun, an industrial conglomerate. As a result, their frenetic overseas investments have slowed sharply this year. Wanda has sold many hotel assets. Anbangâ€™s founder has been detained. Yet this is not the assault on entrepreneurs that some make it out to be. Of the 2,130 people on the Hurun rich list, a guide to Chinaâ€™s ultra-wealthy, just five fell foul of the law last year (see chart). By comparison, Mr Xiâ€™s anti-corruption campaign has ensnared nearly 10% of the partyâ€™s 205-member central committee in five years. <img alt="""" class=""component-image__img blog-post-article-image blog-post-article-image__slim"" data-reactid=""481"" sizes=""(min-width: 600px) 640px, calc(100vw - 20px)"" src=""https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20171028_WBC050.png"" srcset=""//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/200-width/20171028_WBC050.png 200w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/300-width/20171028_WBC050.png 300w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/400-width/20171028_WBC050.png 400w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/640-width/20171028_WBC050.png 640w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/800-width/20171028_WBC050.png 800w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/1000-width/20171028_WBC050.png 1000w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/1200-width/20171028_WBC050.png 1200w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/1280-width/20171028_WBC050.png 1280w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/1600-width/20171028_WBC050.png 1600w""/> Restrictions on the four high-flying companies are best seen as a by-product of stricter financial regulation, says Joe Ngai of McKinsey, a consultancy. Belatedly, officials have taken a hard line on risky funding, especially for overseas acquisitions. At the same time, the fortunes of tycoons with businesses geared to the domestic marketâ€”in tech, property or manufacturingâ€”have soared. Wealth on the Hurun list has more than doubled under Mr Xi. Another concern is tightened control of the technology sector. TheÂ Wall Street JournalÂ reported this month that internet regulators might take 1% stakes in social-media giants, including Youku, Alibabaâ€™s YouTube-like platform, and Weibo, Chinaâ€™s answer to Twitter. But the government already has a good handle on its tech superstars. None can get far in China if it angers the party or turns down data requests from state security. And they already serve up party-pleasing products. Some are lighthearted, like Tencentâ€™s game for WeChat, its ubiquitous mobile app, letting users compete in â€œapplaudingâ€ù Mr Xiâ€™s speech by tapping their phone screens. Others look more sinister, such as techniques to monitor users, which can help authorities keep tabs on citizens. The notion that Mr Xi is stifling innovation is belied by a flourishing of enterprise. Only America has more, and more valuable, startups. Media focused on the party instruction for entrepreneurs to be patriotic, but the directive mostly spelled out how the government can support them. Gary Liu, president of the China Financial Reform Institute, says the real message is that entrepreneurs are vital to the economy. A final concern is Mr Xiâ€™s wish to strengthen the partyâ€™s clout in the corporate world. Hundreds of listed SOEs have amended their articles of association since he took office, vowing to consult party committees on big decisions. The regulator which oversees tech companies last year ordered them to improve their â€œparty buildingâ€ù activities. The party wants members to be placed in more important jobs. Tencent now employs some 7,000 party members, or 23% of its staff; it says that 60% of them are in key roles. But this is not entirely new. After mass closures of SOEs in the 1990s, officials pressed private firms to set up party organisations. As far back as 1999 nearly a fifth of foreign-backed companies had one. There is scant evidence that party cells have tried to sway firmsâ€™ big decisions. Companies may not like them but the cells do not hurt business. Industrial profits averaged nearly 10% of GDP during Mr Xiâ€™s first five-year term, the highest since Chinaâ€™s economic reforms began four decades ago. The party could yet use its cells as beachheads for more control. Regulation of tech firms may get more intrusive. Feeling vulnerable, many of Chinaâ€™s wealthiest entrepreneurs hold foreign passports. But the party knows that a healthy economy needs a vibrant private sector. Perhaps the biggest risk is that, even if Mr Xi means well, the accumulation of so much power in one leader can itself have a chilling effect.

economist,Oct 24th 2017,Public-relations woes may be catching up with Uber," Uberâ€™s position in the market may seem enviable, but it reveals risks in the companyâ€™s strategy. Uber has made consistent losses, with the aim of capturing a huge market share and then being able to raise prices. But that will only work if it remains the most-dominant player in the ride-hailing world and keeps rivals at bay.Â  Other data from the Certify report show the value of dominating a market. The most popular spot for travellers to expense both lunch and dinner in America, for instance, is McDonaldâ€™s. Though it is hardly anyoneâ€™s idea of a hearty business meal, its ubiquity bolsters its popularity.Â  But even McDonaldâ€™s cannot raise prices without losing business. That is because it has so many competitors snapping at its heels. Uber hoped to transcend this issue by capturing a vast market share. But if the latest report is a sign of a real trend, Uberâ€™s dominance may be waning.

economist,Oct 21st 2017,Firms that burn up $1bn a year are sexy but statistically doomed," Take the vision thing first. A charismatic leader with a world-changing plan is de rigueur. For its first 23 years Chesapeake was led by Aubrey McClendon, a cocky Oklahoman who pioneered the process of blasting rocks to extract gas and oil (he died last year in a high-speed car crash). Reed Hastings at Netflix plans to destroy the conventional TV industry by selling films and shows over the internet. Like Mr Musk, Travis Kalanick, Uberâ€™s tarnished former boss, dreams of changing how humans travel. Nextera is led by technocrats but their aim is grandioseâ€”to usher in a new generation of energy technology. The vision needs to be validated by runaway growth. Often firms emphasise a flattering operating measure, such as oil and gas pumped from the ground, the number of rides hailed and so on. Investors need to believe in a high â€œterminal valueâ€ù, a point in the future when high, stable profits will arrive. So it helps to show that, hypothetically, profits would gush if breakneck growth were to stop. Uber says it is profitable in cities where it has operated longest, such as San Francisco. Nextera says that if it stopped investing in new capacity, it would make $6bn of free cashflow a year. Netflix amortises the cost of content over periods of up to five years, so reports an accounting profit even as it bleeds cash. The third element is financing to pay for huge cumulative losses. Each of the five firms has been a financial innovator, taking advantage of cheap money and growth-hungry investors. Uber has tapped private capital markets, Nextera has structured part of its business as a partnership, Tesla has taken deposits from customers and also trades environmental tax credits. Chesapeake Energy sparked Wall Streetâ€™s lust for shale junk bonds, and Netflix has signed commitments to make $14bn of future payments to studios and artists to buy creative content. So sustaining a reality distortion field is possible, but the longer it goes on for, the harder it gets. More capital has to be raised and, in order to justify it, the bigger the firmâ€™s projected ultimate sizeâ€”its terminal valueâ€”has to be. Fast growth puts huge strain on managers. At some point the edifice can come tumbling down. The five companies described here have $60bn of borrowings, and one, Chesapeake, is struggling with its debt load. Poker face A few firms other than Amazon have defied the odds. Over the past 20 years Las Vegas Sands, a casino firm, Royal Caribbean, a cruise-line company, and Micron Technology, a chip-maker, each lost $1bn or more for two consecutive years and went on to prosper. But the chances of success are slim. Of the current members of the Russell 1000 index, since 1997 only 37 have lost $1bn or more for at least two years in a row. Of these, 21 still lose money. To justify their valuations, the five firms examined by Schumpeter must grow their sales by an estimated 8-33% each year for a decade. Based on the record of all American companies since 1950, and the five firmsâ€™ present revenue levels, the probability of this happening ranges between 0.1% and 25%, using statistical tables from Credit Suisse, a bank. Firms that burn piles of cash are often lionised in an era when growth is sluggish and few companies reinvest all their profits. But losing a billion dollars or more a year is a wildly risky affair and the odds are that such businesses will fall flat. This should not be a surpriseâ€”hardly anyone can pull off building a fashion empire around androgyny, wearing a raw meat dress to an awards ceremony, or singing about life on Mars.

economist,Oct 21st 2017,A rash of bankruptcies hits Chinese lenders backed by state firms," They were â€œmarriages of convenienceâ€ù, says Joe Zhang, chairman of China Smartpay, a financial-services company. The P2P firms got instant credibility; SOEs, many of them struggling, eyed quick profits. Some will have done well from the P2P boom: industry-wide loans have increased more than 30-fold since January 2014, to 1.1trn yuan. Yet this frenzied activity has also left problems in its wake. On average more than 100 P2P firms have failed each month since early 2015, some because of mismanagement, others victims of outright fraud. Investors imagined SOE-backed platforms would be safer. Jinsu Online, a P2P lender backed by a subsidiary of the China National Nuclear Corporation, said its backer would guarantee all its funds. Lala Wealth, backed by a subsidiary of the Aviation Industry Corporation of China, vowed that its SOE shareholders would make it stronger. Both went into default last month. In the former case, the SOE had denied any involvement before the collapse; in the latter the SOE said it, too, was a victim. The body that regulates Chinaâ€™s state firms warned them last year to stay clear of P2P, fearing that online lenders would exploit their reputations. But industry data show an increase in the number of P2P firms with SOE shareholders since then of a third, to nearly 200. It seems odd that the government has such weak control over SOEs, given President Xi Jinpingâ€™s tightening grip on Chinaâ€™s economy. But more than 100,000 companies technically count as SOEs. Most are owned by local governments. Moreover, as many as five layers of ownership have separated those that invested in P2P lenders from their parent groups; many also include private businesses as large shareholders. An optimistic conclusion is that these collapses might teach investors to think twice before assuming that the state always stands behind SOEs, however risky. A worrying one is that many still rely on such support.

economist,Oct 21st 2017,Workers are not switching jobs more often," American workers are also now less likely to move home to find new work (see article). Fewer than 12% moved home last year, down from 20% in the 1950s. This pattern is true of younger workers, too: only a fifth of Americans between the ages of 25 and 35 moved last year; for past generations the fraction was closer to a quarter. One place where millennials probably are switching jobs more often is western Europe. Data from the OECD, a think-tank, show that since 1992 in each of France, Germany, Italy and Spain, the average job tenure for workers has increased overall. But it has shortened for younger workers. However, it is far from clear that this is by the young workersâ€™ choice. Labour-market restrictions in Europe have forced a growing share of workers into temporary â€œgigsâ€ù. Over half of workers aged 15 to 24 in those four countries are on fixed-term contracts. Data on Britain, which has looser labour-market regulations than continental Europe, tell a more complicated tale. OECD statistics show that average job tenures have fallen for young Brits. But research from the Resolution Foundation, another think-tank, finds that millennials are actually less likely to leave jobs voluntarily than the previous generation. Britons are also moving home less often. Between 2001 and 2016, the share of workers moving home to change jobs fell from around 0.7% to 0.5%. The number of workers doing so for work in Britain has risen again in recent years, but is still below its 2001 peak. Some workers are indeed hopping from startup to startup every six months, or working as quasi-freelancers for Uber. But they are the exceptions. A drastic increase in job-switching rates would probably require a correspondingly drastic increase in labour demand. Those who fret that millennials are fickle may have too rosy a view of the labour market.

It is a final set of American demands that is most contentious. Ms Freeland talked of â€œunconventionalâ€ù proposals that made her teamâ€™s work â€œmuch more challengingâ€ù. John Murphy of the United States Chamber of Commerce, a business lobby, was blunter, describing them as â€œso extreme that they allow no room for negotiationâ€ù. The first is a five-year â€œsunsetâ€ù clause, forcing a systematic regular review of the deal. Presumably the American administration believes this would deter its trading partners from bad behaviour. More probably, it would chill cross-border investment and trade. Nuno LimÃ£o, a professor of economics at the University of Maryland, has found that a hefty chunk of the trade-stimulating impact of deals comes from increased predictability. A sunset clause embedding uncertainty would do the reverse. On October 17th Mr Lighthizer, who does not see his job as promoting investment in Mexico, seemed unmoved by such concerns, asking why businesses did not just factor the risk into their decision-making. Making America grate again The second deal-breaker covers the car industry, responsible for more than a quarter of American imports from Mexico and Canada and, in Mexicoâ€™s case, all of the trade deficit in goods. Mr Trump wants to bring American jobs back from its neighbours, and eliminate the bilateral trade deficit. At present, at least 62.5% of a vehicle must be from within NAFTA members to qualify for tariff-free treatment. Mr Lighthizer wants that raised to 85%, with an extra requirement of 50% American content. Those involved in the industry squeal at the disruption such changes would inflict on deeply integrated supply chains. Official statistics do not capture the likely fallout. In a recent article Wilbur Ross, Americaâ€™s commerce secretary, who has reportedly been pushing for tighter rules, complained that only 16% of the value embedded in Mexican exports to America is American. But a new paper by Alonso de Gortari of Harvard University finds that once the way supply chains are adapted for the export market is taken into account, the true value embedded in Mexican vehicle exports to America is 38%. Rather than bring jobs back to America, the proposed content rules would in the short term force car manufacturers to bypass the deal altogether, instead incurring the 2.5% tariff on cars imported into America. That would raise prices for American consumers and make North American producers less competitive. So unorthodox is the latest batch of demands, introduced only during the latest round of talks, that some question whether the Trump administration is negotiating in good faith. Mr Lighthizer claims to be trying to please only his boss, Mr Trump. But Congress must pass the final deal. This is topsy-turvy. Normally, in Americaâ€™s trade talks, the president plays nice cop to Congressâ€™s tough guy. This time, roles are reversed. Members of Congress are examining whether it has the legal power to block an attempt to withdraw from NAFTA. After four rounds and 22 days of negotiations squeezed into just over two months, there is now a month until the next round. In theory this should give each side time to think of â€œcreative waysâ€ù to narrow their differences. So far the rounds have been packed so tightly together that there has not been much chance to update positions between rounds, nor to share texts in advance. But at this stage, it seems unlikely that any deal that will please the Mexicans, the Canadians, Congress and Mr Trump exists. Mr Flores, the cowboy-shirt exporter, has begun to think beyond NAFTA.

economist,Oct 21st 2017,How should recessions be fought when interest rates are low?," If credible, that promise should buck up animal spirits, encourage spending, and drag the economy back to health. Raising inflation targets would reduce the frequency and severity of ZLB episodes. It would, however, force households to accept higher inflation all the time, rather than just in the aftermath of a severe downturn. A permanent price-level target, for its part, would force central banks to respond to an inflation-increasing blow to the economyâ€”such as a big natural disasterâ€”with rate rises, piling on pain in such cases. Less clear is whether a central bank could fulfil its promise. The Fed has failed to hit its 2% inflation target for the past five years, after all. Mr Bernankeâ€™s proposal would do little good if markets doubted a central bankâ€™s ability to fulfil its promise to deliver catch-up inflation. The constraints facing central banks suggest better hopes for the second way forwardâ€”greater reliance on fiscal policy. This was the theme of a contribution to the conference from Olivier Blanchard and Lawrence Summers, crisis veterans from the IMF and the American administration, respectively. Before the crisis, economists used to dismiss fiscal policy as a recession-fighting tool. Stimulus was clumsy, slow and, given the control exercised by central bankers, unnecessary. But with interest rates near zero, stimulus might be the most effective way to boost demandâ€”so long as the central bank is willing to play along. Recent history, however, suggests that it could certainly not be relied upon to do so. In 2013, the Fed announced it would begin reducing its asset purchases, despite low and falling inflation and an unemployment rate above 7%â€”conditions which might elicit a fiscal stimulus from an anxious government. More government spending in such cases, if deemed likely to raise inflation, might simply prompt a central bank to move forward its timetable for tightening. That would dampenâ€”and perhaps offset entirelyâ€”the effect of the fiscal stimulus. The dawn of a new error So fiscal and monetary policy would have to be closely co-ordinatedâ€”amounting, in all likelihood, to a loss of central-bank autonomy. A central bank that stood by as fiscal stimulus pushed inflation above its target has in effect relinquished its independence. One that stubbornly raised rates as elected leaders sought to boost growth would quickly find its position politically untenableâ€”much as the Federal Reserve did after the election of Franklin Roosevelt in 1932. Just how troubling a loss of independence would be is intensely debated. Messrs Blanchard and Summers are themselves at odds on it: Mr Summers is open to relaxing independence; Mr Blanchard worries that politicised central banks might have been too timid during the crisis, just as many governments turned too quickly to austerity. Other economists cite a more common fear: that governments would inevitably push for too much monetary stimulus, accelerating inflation. Central-bank independence was an institutional response to the inflation of the 1970s, just as government business-cycle management was a response to the Depression. But the rules that underpinned the conditions of the 1970s seem no longer to apply. For a decade (more, in Japan) inflation and interest rates have limped along at historically low levels, even as government debts ballooned and central banks created piles of new money. That presents a significant problem for prevailing institutions, but also for conventional macroeconomic wisdom. In the 1970s, an intellectual shift within economics took place in tandem with the change in policy practice. The discipline could explain why predictable monetary policy set by independent central banks was preferable to a governmentâ€™s attempts to spend its way to full employment. Yet things need not unfold that way this time. With economists at odds as future ZLB episodes loom, the example of the 1930s might be more apt. Then populist politicians struck out in unorthodox new directions, for better and occasionally much worse. It was only later that experts could settle on a coherent narrative of the crisis and recovery. That is not the ideal way forward. Yet it may be the only option available.

economist,Oct 20th 2017,Hotels are employing fewer concierges," Another reason is that many people would rather interact with their smartphones than hotel staff. In July aÂ surveyÂ found that half of business travellers said they prefer to avoid human contact altogether when on the road. Unsurprisingly, concierges still think they have an important role to play. They argue that many people still prefer the human touch to a life conducted on screens, as WHYY reported. They tell stories of great feats of valour, using their knowledge and connections to, for example, rescue a brideâ€™s dress from a closed dry cleaner on the day of the wedding. And, increasingly, they are turning to technology themselves. With a tablet in hand, some concierges approach guests, seeking to guide them with their internet research. Some hotels are turning to more novel approaches to try to keep concierges relevant. In July the Park Hyatt hotel in MelbourneÂ hiredÂ a blonde labrador called Mr Walker as a canine concierge.

Sales at Beijing Hyundai, jointly owned by the South Korean conglomerate and Chinese manufacturerÂ BAIC Motor, dropped by two-fifths in the first eight months of the year. AmorePacific, a cosmetics firm in South Korea, reported a 58% dip in its second-quarter operating profits. The countryâ€™s tourism industry, too, has felt the pinch since group tours from China were banned in March. There were 87% fewer Chinese tourists on Jeju, a pretty island south of the peninsula, during this yearâ€™s harvest festival than in 2016. Korean businesses will lose $15.6bn of tourism revenue if the slump continues until next March, according to the Hyundai Research Institute, a think-tank funded by the conglomerate. Korean industries other than tourism could lose $8.3bn over the row, says the Korea Development Bank.Â  Yet the boycott is being applied selectively. It favours some Chinese firms by penalising their South Korean competitors, while leavingÂ manufacturersÂ on the mainland free to continue importing the parts on which their businesses rely from other South Korean firms, notes Choi Pae-kun, an economistÂ at Konkuk University in Seoul. Korean exports to China jumped by 23% in September compared with the same month last year, driven in part by surging demand for memory chips,Â many of which are made by Samsung. The row with China may obscure some failings of South Korean business. Carmakersâ€™ share of the Chinese market fell from 9% in 2014 to 7% in 2016, before the row. Partly due to competition from online retailers, Lotte Mart has been losing money in China since 2011. But the events of March were undoubtedly a turning point. Beijing Hyundaiâ€™s sales rose in January and February, but plunged by 65% in May. Lotte Martâ€™s overseas losses are predicted to rise from 124bn won in 2016 to 250bn won this year. â€œIt canâ€™t be 100% THAAD,â€ù says Kim Soo-min, a lawmaker. â€œBut even if there were losses before, they would not suddenly more than double in a year.â€ù Â  Chinaâ€™s stance may be shifting. Mr Han says an agreement on October 13th to extend a currency-swap deal between South Korea and China was a â€œgestureâ€ù of peace from Beijing.Â China will surely see little point continuing the boycott, since it failed to stop the remaining THAAD launchers being installed last month, he argues. Some analysts predict that China will end its ban on tour groups visiting South Korea after the Communist Partyâ€™s congress, which began on October 18th. â€œThere is a little bit of hope,â€ù says Ms Kim.

economist,Oct 19th 2017,Saudi Aramcoâ€™s IPO is a mess," Listing initially on the Tadawul only, as well as doing a private placement, may be a misguided attempt by MBS to skirt some of these difficulties, advisers say. It is seen as a way to promote the Saudi capital markets, and avoid the impression of selling off the family silver to foreigners. But with a limited pool of capital in the kingdom, some say a listing there could never raise the $100bn that MBS needs for his so-called Public Investment Fund to bankroll non-oil investments in the country. Advisers say the kingdom is also considering recent expressions of interest by Chinese oil companies and other Asian investors, who are keen to take up to a 5% stake in Aramco. The attraction is that it would further cement ties between the worldâ€™s biggest producer and huge consumers of oil. But it would be unlikely to give the crown prince the $2trn valuation he wants, unless he guarantees large supplies of cheap oil as a side deal. The confusion is uncomfortable for Aramco, which, as national oil companies go, should be an attractive bet for investors. It has 15 times more reserves of oil and gas than ExxonMobil, its biggest private competitor, higher production, fewer employees and lower costs per barrel. It also has an abundance of young (including many female) engineers, and technology that can almost visualise the sea of oil beneath the desert sands. Its executives say that efficiencies inherited from the days that it was American-owned persist. Many Aramcons, as company officials are known, appear to view the IPO as an unwelcome distraction, but are at least mollified by the prestige they think an international listing would confer. To achieve that goal, MBS may need to reflect further on what an IPO means. His government is Aramcoâ€™s only shareholder and should, of course, have the final say. But unless he is prepared to loosen the reins, allow the IPO to advance at a prudent pace, and let investors decide what the correct value is, he might do better to scrap it altogether. His attitude so far suggests too little faith in the market forces that he wants to unleash.

economist,Oct 19th 2017,Why Airbusâ€™s tie-up with Bombardier is so damaging for Boeing," But overturning the tariffs may be easier said than done. Jennifer Hillman of Georgetown University, who was a commissioner at Americaâ€™s International Trade Commission (USITC), thinks that the deal comes too late to affect the decision to impose anti-dumping or anti-subsidy duties against the C-Series (although the USITC may strike down the duties anyway). Boeing has insisted that any duties should be â€œpaid on any imported C-Series airplane or partâ€ù. It could also argue that not enough value was added in assembly, and that Airbus therefore should still face the duties. Airbus and Bombardierâ€™s manoeuvre â€œlooks like a questionable deal between two heavily state-subsidised competitors to skirt the recent findings of the US governmentâ€ù, Boeing said. It is right to fear the new combination. Although Airbus has lost ground in â€œwidebodyâ€ù jets recently as it refreshes its range, the European giant has already grabbed half the market for â€œnarrowbodiesâ€ù such as the C-Series. Analysts think the tie-up will further tighten Airbusâ€™s grip. Boeing may now have to spend tens of billions of dollars launching a new narrowbody jet to compete, much sooner than planned. And by pushing for tariffs on the C-Series, Boeing has annoyed customers, from Delta to the governments of Canada and Britain, which are threatening to tear up future military contracts. News of the tie-up was greeted warmly not only in Canada but also in Northern Ireland, where the C-Seriesâ€™ wings are made. The Democratic Unionist Party, the provinceâ€™s largest party, which supports the government of Theresa May, the British prime minister, said it was â€œthrilledâ€ù with the deal. For Boeing, â€œthe wounds are self-inflictedâ€ù, says Adam Pilarski, the former chief economist of McDonnell-Douglas, now part of Boeing. If Boeing had let the Canadian minnow alone, after all, the C-Series would probably have sold only 300 or so planes. But now Boeingâ€™s tariffs have destroyed the C-Seriesâ€™ value and handed it to its rival for free. Airbus wants to sell up to 6,000 of the planes over the next 20 years. The triumph of the â€œcute little planeâ€ù, as Airbus once dismissively dubbed the C-Series, however, should not obscure a more troubling trend, which is the increasing dominance of Airbus and Boeing in aerospace. Instead of breaking their duopoly, Bombardier was consumed by it.

Whether Mr Yadavâ€™s aircraft are airworthy is unproven. He says they are, and might know, given his day job as a captain for Jet Airways, a private airline. Mr Yadav wants Americaâ€™s Federal Aviation Administration to certify his planesâ€”he will soon apply to itâ€”and Indiaâ€™s bureaucrats to accept its verdict. Private backers want to invest in his budding aviation venture, Mr Yadav says, but that might alter its destiny as a future national champion. No aircraft-maker anywhere has thrived without state backing, he notes, usually through defence contracts. He also has blueprints for a fighter jet, development of which would cost half the $250m or so India pays to buy a single jet from Dassault, a French manufacturerâ€”if only bureaucrats would grasp his vision, that is.

economist,Oct 19th 2017,A Lloydâ€™s report urges insurers to ask â€œwhat if?â€ù," Adding a layer of what-if analysis may well increase premiums, as insurers realise they need to be more cautious about certain risks than losses suggest. But it could also reduce some premiums, particularly for emerging perils that underwriters tend to overprice so long as they lack data. â€œWe are most scared about things we donâ€™t understand,â€ù says Jonathon Gascoigne of Willis Towers Watson, an insurance broker. Launching an in-depth investigation into every near-miss would be costly. It might make more sense for several insurers to pool resources. Better still, says Trevor Maynard from Lloydâ€™s, if other bodies also joined in, from municipalities and governments to capital providers. They too share an interest in preparing for disaster. Today it is hard for insurers to raise premiums, though this may change once hurricane-season claims come in. Many struggle to stay profitable; around a third of the London market expects to lose money from underwriting in 2017, according to PwC, a consultancy. Low interest rates and weak capital returns mean few can count on investment income to make up for lousy business. In this context, some might be tempted to undercharge for risk, says Mr Woo, adding that now more than ever â€œinsurers would benefit from looking at the past as just one realisation of what might have happenedâ€ù.

economist,Oct 19th 2017,Higher taxes can lower inequality without denting economic growth," Another reason that governments might have driven down top tax rates could be to create greater incentives to invest, thereby boosting economic growth. That certainly seems to be the rationale behind the cuts being proposed by President Donald Trump. But the IMF, after analysing tax rates in OECD countries between 1981 and 2016, found no strong relationship between how progressive a tax system is and economic growth. Indeed the study adds that for countries wanting to redistribute wealth, there may be â€œscope for increasing the progressivity of income taxation without significantly hurting growthâ€ù. The latter sentence will be seized on by politicians on the left. But the argument works better in some places than in others. The IMF reckons that the optimal tax rate on higher incomes, assuming the aim is revenue maximisation, is 44%. Britainâ€™s highest rate is already 45%. So the IMF study does not really provide much ammunition for Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the Labour Party, the main opposition, who wants to raise it to 50%. It is a better argument, perhaps, for Bernie Sanders, the Democrat, since the top American tax rate, before any Trump cuts, is only 39.6%. Even here, a note of caution is needed. Companies are inclined to move in search of more favourable tax treatmentâ€”hence the success of Ireland in attracting business with its 12.5% corporate-tax rate, and the row about â€œinversionsâ€ù where American companies move overseas to lower-tax jurisdictions. In response, countries have steadily lowered corporate-tax rates; since 1990 the average rate in advanced economies has fallen by more than 13 percentage points (see chart). Many rich individuals can choose to shift the way they report their income to take advantage of lower corporate-tax rates. So it is difficult to push up the tax rate on individual incomes while simultaneously lowering the corporate rate. As the IMF report drily remarks: â€œInternational tax co-ordination could potentially address this problem but has proved very difficult to implement.â€ù So are there other ways to reduce inequality via the tax system? Another option discussed by the IMF is taxing property, which is an immovable asset. Inheritance taxes are another possibility, although they are costly to administer, and no G7 country raises more than 1% of GDP through this route. Given the political clout of the rich, it seems unlikely that an international consensus on reducing inequality through higher taxes is going to emerge. In the absence of such a consensus, few governments will take the risk of raising their own rates unilaterally. Step forward, however, a future Corbyn government, which plans to increase the tax rate on companies as well as on individualsâ€”all in the context of Brexit, when companies might in any case be reconsidering their decision to invest in Britain. It will be an economic experiment closely watched by other countries, suggesting a new national slogan: â€œBritainâ€”we try policies so you donâ€™t have to.â€ù * https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/FM/Issues/ Economist.com/blogs/buttonwood This article appeared in the Finance and economics section of the print edition under the headline ""A taxing problem""",https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21730423-new-study-imf-finds-no-strong-correlation-between-lower-taxes-and-higher
economist,Oct 19th 2017,Private jets are getting cheaper," Part of this is explained by oversupply. A glut of corporate aircraft is flooding the market, pushing many manufacturers, such as Gulfstream and Bombardier, to cut back production. And when jet-owners upgrade to new models they flog their old wings. This depresses second-hand prices further, as Oliver Stone of Colibri Aircraft told the Financial Times. Despite an economic recovery in America, demand for private jets has remained weak. And sales in emerging markets dropped off after commodity prices collapsed in 2014.Â  Corporate belt-tightening has dampened demand further. Tesco, a supermarket, sold or returned its five planes in 2014 and 2015. In September GE announced that it would sell its corporate fleet. It hopes to save money by making executives travel on charter or commercial flights. That is just as well, because it will not get much for its planes on the second-hand market.

economist,Oct 18th 2017,When the revolution eats itself," But it is not clear whether the government can afford, politically, to do what business leaders want: settle the bill with the EU and stay in the single market and customs union. Brexiteers will see this as a betrayal. And the Conservatives will get no help from the Labour Party, which has a clear political interest in seeing the negotiations fail. The party can simply demand that the government deliver on the Leave campaign promises, knowing that this will be impossible. We are at the stage of the battle between the Girondins and the Jacobins in the French revolution. The Girondins may have helped to bring down Louis XVI but they found themselves outflanked by the Jacobins who in turn were consumed by the violence they unleashed. There is now lots of talk of â€œno dealâ€ù, creating the risk of a chaotic breakdown in trade, with backlogsÂ of lorriesÂ from Dover to the M25. This is crazy stuff. While the Conservatives are battling with each other, the only cause they are serving is that of Jeremy Corbynâ€™s Labour Party. Let me sketch out a plausible outcome. In a last minute-deal in early 2019, Mrs May gives in on the main issues to the EUâ€”on money, the European Court of Justice and migration. This is seen as a betrayal by her backbenchers, who force her out. A new prime minister takes over. That person calls an electionâ€”possibly on the grounds of repudiating the deal or merely to give themselves a mandate. With the Conservatives in a mess, Labour sweeps to power with a manifesto promising higher taxes on individuals and companies, nationalisation and changes to the labour market to enhance workersâ€™ rights. This is where the economic and political risk comes in. In the aftermath of the referendum, the pound plunged but London stockmarket did fairly well (in local currency terms) because of the overseas earnings of many listed companies. Since then, it has been pretty clear that the markets have been happiest when a deal with the EU looks more plausible. But a post-Brexit, Corbyn-led Britain would prompt international investors to fundamentally reassess their view of the economy. For 30 years or more, Britain has been seen as a welcome home for international capital, an English-speaking, business-friendly place for companies to base themselves inside the EU. Those advantages would have gone. There would not be an overnight exodus, but the supply of new investment would stop and existing businesses would reconsider their position. The economy would take a hit and that would in turn limit the ability of the Bank of England to support the pound with higher rates; so both sterling and the stockmarket might suffer. Investors are aware of some of thisâ€”a net 31% of those polled by Bank of America are underweight British equitiesâ€”but the nearer we get to March 2019 without a deal the more nervous they will become.

economist,Oct 17th 2017,More airlines are offering free Wi-Fi for messaging services," But now airlines like Delta and American have been introducing satellite internet, as opposed to the current systems which work by planes relaying signals to and from networks on the ground. In the past, carriers have been slow to add satellite internet because installing an antenna on the outside of a plane increases drag and thereby fuel costs. But often where satellite internet is used, internet speeds are much faster. Soon, connections may be robust enough to allow all passengers to browse simultaneously. And once one major airline provides free, fast internet to all passengers, there will, no doubt, be plenty of pressure on rivals to do the same. Business travellers, students, those who want to stay connected as well as flyers who want more in-flight entertainment will all be willing to pay a little extra for a flight that offers free internet. How much more they will be happy to spend remains to be seen. But just as internet access has spread across hotels and cafÃ©s, it will surely spread at 35,000 feet. It is simply a matter of time.

It is a final set of American demands that is most contentious. Ms Freeland talked of â€œunconventionalâ€ù proposals that made her teamâ€™s work â€œmuch more challengingâ€ù. John Murphy of the United States Chamber of Commerce, a business lobby, was blunter, describing them as â€œso extreme that they allow no room for negotiationâ€ù. The first is a five-year â€œsunsetâ€ù clause, forcing a systematic regular review of the deal. Presumably the American administration believes this would deter its trading partners from bad behaviour. More probably, it would chill cross-border investment and trade. Nuno LimÃ£o, a professor of economics at the University of Maryland, has found that a hefty chunk of the trade-stimulating impact of deals comes from increased predictability. A sunset clause embedding uncertainty would do the reverse. On October 17th Mr Lighthizer, who does not see his job as promoting investment in Mexico, seemed unmoved by such concerns, asking why businesses did not just factor the risk into their decision-making. Making America grate again The second deal-breaker covers the car industry, responsible for more than a quarter of American imports from Mexico and Canada and, in Mexicoâ€™s case, all of the trade deficit in goods. Mr Trump wants to bring American jobs back from its neighbours, and eliminate the bilateral trade deficit. At present, at least 62.5% of a vehicle must be from within NAFTA members to qualify for tariff-free treatment. Mr Lighthizer wants that raised to 85%, with an extra requirement of 50% American content. Those involved in the industry squeal at the disruption such changes would inflict on deeply integrated supply chains. Official statistics do not capture the likely fallout. In a recent article Wilbur Ross, Americaâ€™s commerce secretary, who has reportedly been pushing for tighter rules, complained that only 16% of the value embedded in Mexican exports to America is American. But a new paper by Alonso de Gortari of Harvard University finds that once the way supply chains are adapted for the export market is taken into account, the true value embedded in Mexican vehicle exports to America is 38%. Rather than bring jobs back to America, the proposed content rules would in the short term force car manufacturers to bypass the deal altogether, instead incurring the 2.5% tariff on cars imported into America. That would raise prices for American consumers and make North American producers less competitive. So unorthodox is the latest batch of demands, introduced only during the latest round of talks, that some question whether the Trump administration is negotiating in good faith. Mr Lighthizer claims to be trying to please only his boss, Mr Trump. But Congress must pass the final deal. This is topsy-turvy. Normally, in Americaâ€™s trade talks, the president plays nice cop to Congressâ€™s tough guy. This time, roles are reversed. Members of Congress are examining whether it has the legal power to block an attempt to withdraw from NAFTA. After four rounds and 22 days of negotiations squeezed into just over two months, there is now a month until the next round. In theory this should give each side time to think of â€œcreative waysâ€ù to narrow their differences. So far the rounds have been packed so tightly together that there has not been much chance to update positions between rounds, nor to share texts in advance. But at this stage, it seems unlikely that any deal that will please the Mexicans, the Canadians, Congress and Mr Trump exists. Mr Flores, the cowboy-shirt exporter, has begun to think beyond NAFTA. After all, â€œthere are other countries to sell to.â€ù This article appeared in the Finance and economics section of the print edition under the headline ""Preparing for the worst""",https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21730420-american-demands-are-so-extreme-some-suspect-it-not-wanting-deal-all
economist,Oct 12th 2017,Technology is revolutionising supply-chain finance," Unmet demand looks enormous. Even domestic supply chains are extensive. A new study by Mercedes Delgado of MITâ€™s Sloan School and Karen Mills of Harvard Business School finds that American firms supplying other firms employ 44m people. Of those, employers of 26.8m are involved in international trade. So far financing programmes have largely focused on big corporations and their first-tier suppliers. Among the obstacles to growth are know-your-customer and anti-money-laundering rules. The Asian Development Bank estimates the annual global â€œfinance gapâ€ù in trade finance, a related field, at $1.5trn. Anand Pande, head of supply-chain finance at iGTB, which provides technology to banks, calls supply-chain finance â€œa land of unrealised promiseâ€ù. That is true for both banks and borrowers. Eric Li of Coalition, a research firm, forecasts that this year large banksâ€™ revenues from programmes instigated by big buyers will be $2.8bn, 28% more than in 2010. If supplier-led finance is included, growth has been just 18%, far less than for lending volumes. Margins have been squeezed. The market is fragmented, Mr Li notes. After the financial crisis, many banks cut back their foreign operations. Only connect They also face competition. Technology firms are pushing into supply chains. Online lenders have made less impact than third-party platforms that match buyers and suppliers to sources of finance. PrimeRevenue, for instance, connects 70 lenders, including 50-odd banks, to 25,000 suppliers with $7bn-worth of invoices a month. There is also space for specialists. Innervation Finance, based in New York, manages programmes for buyers offering finance to â€œdiverseâ€ù suppliers (eg, run by people from ethnic minorities, women, veterans, the disabled or gay people) in banking, manufacturing and pharmaceuticals. Mark Ferguson, the chief executive, says the cost of capital for such firms may be two or three times that of other small businesses. More banks are setting up programmes. Bank of Baroda, a public-sector bank that is Indiaâ€™s fifth-biggest by assets, began only a few months ago. Litesh Majethia, who runs the supply-chain business, admits that rival banks are already established. But with small and medium-sized Indian firms facing a funding gap of $400bn, he says, there is plenty of room; and a spanking new digitised system is a plus. Banks are not, however, being overthrown by technological upstartsâ€”as, say, high-street retailers have been by Amazon. Symbiosis is the rule. Two big banks, HSBC and Santander, have allied with Tradeshift, an invoicing, finance and procurement network that connects over 1.5m buyers and suppliers worldwide. HSBC has also joined forces with GT Nexus, a global supply-chain management platform. Banks can tap into a new pool of customers; companies in the tech firmsâ€™ networks can find finance more easily. Smaller local banks, however, may lose out as the market expands, and suppliers spurn them to borrow more cheaply from larger lenders. Technology is opening up more possibilities. C2FO, another financial-technology firm, matches suppliersâ€™ requests for payment at a date and interest rate of their choosing, with buyers willing to lend. Typical supply-chain finance, says Sandy Kemper, C2FOâ€™s boss, is far less flexible. His platform is available to smaller suppliers. Back-to-back deals along the chain are even allowing third- and fourth-tier suppliers to join in. No bank is involved, though the firm has recently teamed up with Citigroup. Citi can lend to more companies; C2FO gains access to the giantâ€™s clients. More is in the pipeline: banks are exploring, for example, how blockchain technology might align the flow of data and money more closely with the flow of goods. Bainâ€™s Mr Olsen sees several business models emerging, some led by single banks, some by groups of them, and others by platforms, big companies and e-commerce firms such as Amazon and Alibaba. Not every bank will win. The smaller fry in the worldâ€™s supply chains just might.

economist,Oct 28th 2017,It is now practical to refuel electric vehicles through thin air," For wireless charging to work, a car must necessarily be fitted with a pickup. At the moment, this is a do-it-yourself business. Evatran, a Virginian firm, for example, sells kits of pickup and pad for between $2,500 and $4,000, installation included. According to Rebecca Hough, the firmâ€™s boss, about 11% of the input power is lost during wireless charging with Evatranâ€™s equipment. But plugging in a cord charger, she says, involves similar losses. The absence in cord charging of the air gap involved in wireless charging means cord charging requires a special (and power-draining) transformer to protect against surges. Evatran is not alone in the DIY induction business. HEVO, a company based in New York, will install a pickup for $3,000. HEVO also wants to take charging out of the home garage, by building networks of pads in cities. These, it intends, will be reserved and rented by drivers using their mobile phones. If wireless charging is to become more than a bespoke curiosity, though, vehicle manufacturers will have to get involved as well. This is starting to happen. Evatran says that, next year, at least two carmakers will start fitting its pickups to their products as they are being assembled. WiTricity, a firm in Massachusetts that, like Evatran, designs both pickups and pads, has licensed its pickup design to Toyota, and also to two car-components companies, TDK of Japan and Delphi of Britain. Other carmakers, including Audi, BMW, Daimler, Ford, Jaguar, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo, are likewise expected to launch remote-charging-ready vehicles soon. Nor are cars the only vehicles for which wireless charging beckons. Also next year, WAVE, a firm in Utah, plans to install a much more powerful version of the technology at the port of Los Angeles, for a monster vehicle (its tyres are higher than a tall man) which grabs, moves and stacks loaded containers. This will bypass one of the portâ€™s more arcane practices since, at the moment, the International Longshore and Warehouse Union permits only electricians to plug in the cords of electric vehicles at the port, which makes operating such vehicles there remarkably expensive. And wireless charging is especially promising for buses, says Andrew Daga, the boss of Momentum Dynamics, a firm in Pennsylvania that sells more of its charging units for buses than for cars. A big obstacle to the uptake of electric buses is the need to take them out of service for part of the day to recharge them. If, thanks to wireless charging, such a bus can sip enough power en route to keep it chugging along until it can be given a charge overnight, it can at last, he says, compete with the diesel sort. One place where this is already happening is Milton Keynes, a town north-west of London. The Line 7 route in this town is serviced by electric buses that pause for two to four minutes over charging pads at each end of the line. Both pads have four buried coils, which can transfer power at a rate of 120 kilowatts. (By comparison, Evatranâ€™s latest single-coil charger for cars provides 7.2 kilowatts.) That is enough for the buses to remain in service for 16 hours a day. The equipment used in Milton Keynes, which is made by IPT Technology, a German firm, costs about Â£100,000 ($130,000) a pad. But the busesâ€™ operator, eFIS, calculates that one of their vehicles costs 50 cents a kilometre less to run than a diesel one, thanks to savings on fuel and engine repair. Collectively, Line 7â€™s eight electric buses drive 700,000km a year. According to John Miles, eFISâ€™s boss, the firm expects to start servicing a second route in Milton Keynes soon, adding two more charging pads and 11 electric buses to the townâ€™s public-transport network. Wirelessly charged buses also run in Mannheim, Germany, in Utrecht, in the Netherlands, and in the Italian cities of Genoa and Turin, as well as in Salt Lake City and the Californian cities of Lancaster, Long Beach, Monterey, Palmdale and Walnut Creek. Los Angeles is expected to join the list next year. A moving experience All of these efforts, though, still depend on a vehicle stopping when it needs to recharge. In that sense, wireless charging is no different from the plug-in variety. But things do not have to be that way. For induction to work, the vehicle does not need to be stationary. The next step will be charging vehicles on the move. Preliminary trials have started. One such is at a 100-metre electrified test track in Versailles, near Paris. This test, run by VEDECOM, a government transport-research institute, should be finished next year, but initial results are promising. The batteries of two minivans travelling simultaneously along the track at more than 100kph can successfully absorb 20 kilowatts each. Qualcomm, the firm that makes the equipment being tested, known as Halo, says it has already licensed the technology involved to 13 car-parts firms. One market the firm thinks promising is electrifying taxi ranks. As Graeme Davison, who is in charge of marketing Halo, observes, â€œno taxi driver on Godâ€™s earthâ€ù will keep getting out of his cab to swap charging flexes as the queue at the rank creeps forward. Israel is also interested in charging vehicles on the move. Shay Soffer, the chief scientist at the countryâ€™s transport ministry, has overseen the electrification of a short stretch of road in Tel Aviv, where tests will begin next year. He does not think electrifying roadways will be unworkably expensive. Oren Ezer of ElectRoad, the firm that converted the road in question, reckons a small crew, working three night shifts, could convert a kilometre of tarmac in this way. A lead vehicle would cut trenching into the existing surface and sweep up debris. A second, piled with electrical kit, would follow, with workers tucking the equipment into place in the trench as it travelled. A third would then fill the trench with fresh asphalt. Whether such on-the-fly charging actually will be practical is moot. But the stationary sort looks set for take-off. Though plugs in cars are unlikely to vanish, the power of induction seems here to stay.

economist,Oct 26th 2017,"After years of persecution, whales are getting their own back"," What to do about all this is tricky. No one wants to return to the free-for-all, but attempts to deter whales by playing noises at them have failed. The animals just treat those noises as dinner gongs. And trying to outrun a whale, once it has latched onto a boat in the expectation of an easy meal, is futile, for whales are strong swimmers. Researchers at SEASWAP are working to find new ways to avoid the whales. They have successfully created monitoring systems to pinpoint whale-free waters in which boats can safely deploy their lines. They are also experimenting with acoustic decoy buoys that broadcast recordings of boats, in order to lure whales away from the real ones. Early results indicate that these buoys can summon whales from a distance of up to ten nautical miles. Another approach is to change fishing methods. This year the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, which regulates Alaskaâ€™s fisherfolk, approved a novel way to fish for black codâ€”the use of pots similar to those employed to catch crabs and lobsters. These, experience suggests, greatly reduce whalesâ€™ depredations. But their use is controversial. They require bigger boats than hooked lines, and are costly. Converting a vessel to pot-fishing costs between $100,000 and $300,000. So far, less than 7% of the Gulf of Alaska fleet has adopted the new method, and owners of smaller vessels fear getting squeezed out. Those owners would retain title to their quotas, though, so the upshot might be fewer, larger vessels fishing on behalf of consortia, rather than the rugged individualism of today. If that serves to keep the whales at bay, it may be worth it.

economist,Oct 26th 2017,One species of dinosaur wore a bandit mask," Glare reduction is another hypothesis. Just as athletes sometimes paint dark colours beneath their eyes to reduce the reflection of light from sweaty skin into their pupils, so a band of darkness near the eyes might improve an animalâ€™s vision. For badgers and skunks, though, the stripes are probably there to provide the opposite of inconspicuousness. They are actually warnings to potential predators, saying â€œdonâ€™t mess with me or I will rip your leg off/spray you with something so horrible that nothing will go near you for weeks.â€ù Which of these jobs the mask did for Sinosauropteryx remains a matter of speculationâ€”though its gracile body suggests dismembering things was not its strong suit.

economist,Oct 26th 2017,Gene editing takes another step forward," Base editing was invented last year, by David Liu of Harvard University and his colleagues. DNA is composed of four sorts of bases, each attached to one of two molecular backbones that twist together to form the moleculeâ€™s famous double helix. The bases are often referred to as A, C, G and T, the initials of their full chemical names, adenine, cytosine, guanine and thymine. The shapes of these molecules mean that a C on one strand of the double helix is always paired with a G on the opposite strand, and an A with a T. Dr Liuâ€™s base editor combined CRISPR-Cas9 with an enzyme called cytidine deaminase. It also employed a deactivated version of Cas9, meaning that enzyme binds to, but no longer cuts, DNA. The resulting molecular construction was able to find specific G-C base pairs in a cell and convert them to T-A. One of this weekâ€™s papers, published inÂ Nature, describes how to extend the technique to convert A-T pairs into G-C ones, extending the range of genetic errors that can be corrected. Creating this second base editor was harder than the first because an equivalent to the cytidine deaminase used by Dr Liu, which would be needed to pull it off, does not exist in nature. Instead, one member of the group, Nicole Gaudelli of Harvard University, set about creating it. The enzyme needed is an adenine deaminase that works on DNA. Versions of this enzyme do exist, but they act on RNA, a similar but not identical molecule. Dr Gaudelli, though, thought she could tweak an RNA-specific version for use on DNA. To do so, she started with a bacterium calledÂ Escherichia coli, which is much beloved by biologists. TheÂ E. coliÂ she used had defective antibiotic-resistance genes. Crucially, the mutations that had broken these genes could in principle be fixed with an adenine deaminase that worked on DNA. She therefore created a vast range of variants of the RNA version of the gene, hoping that some might instead work on DNAâ€”and manifest that fact by saving bacteria that would otherwise die when they were exposed to antibiotics. By picking the most promising variants, mutating them again, and repeating the process, she eventually arrived at an enzyme that could be attached to CRISPR-Cas9 in order to accomplish the conversion of A-T base pairs into G-C. And it works. The combined base-editing tools have the desired effect more than half the time. Using CRISPR-Cas9 alone for such point-mutation work is only 4% effective. Moreover, CRISPR-Cas9 often creates unwanted insertions or deletions of DNA. Base editing creates almost none. Bases for progress The second paper, published inÂ Science, involves RNA more directly. One of RNAâ€™s most important jobs in a cell is carrying information from genes in the nucleus to the protein-making machinery in the cytoplasm, to tell that machinery what to make. In the paper Feng Zhang, of the Broad Institute, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who was one of the pioneers of the CRISPR-Cas9 technique, describes a base editor made from Cas13, an enzyme that cuts RNA in the way that Cas9 cuts DNA, and a second enzyme that can reverse the effect of G-to-A mutations. Though Dr Zhangâ€™s editor works on RNA rather than DNA its effect, at least temporarily, is the same. By substituting one base for another it changes the compositionâ€”and therefore the activityâ€”of a protein. Though the papers are different, together they demonstrate a wider point, which is that the toolkit of genetic engineering is expanding quickly. In particular, variants of Cas9 are being tested to see if the CRISPR-Cas9 approach can be improved. And another enzyme, Cpf1, is growing rapidly in popularity as a substitute for Cas9 in conjunction with CRISPR. The researchers who have developed base editing even dream of reaching into the epigenome. This is the system by which some genes are switched off by a chemical process called methylation. It is part of the mechanism that determines what type of cell a given cell is. Until recently, epigenomic editing would have seemed a distant prospect. But the speed with which new gene-editing techniques are being invented suggests it would be risky to bet against it happening. For genetic engineering at the moment, the possibilities seem limitless.

economist,Oct 21st 2017,Gravitational-wave astronomy starts in earnest," The difference between the fifth gravitational wave and the other four is its origin. The others were the results of two black holes merging. This one was caused by two neutron stars colliding. Neutron stars are the remnants of supernova explosions. They are, as the name suggests, made almost entirely of neutronsâ€”particles that can pack closely together. Neutron stars are thus small and dense. They are just a few kilometres across even though, typically, they weigh more than the sun. Because normal stars (some of which will end up as neutron stars) are frequently found orbiting each other as pairs in binary systems, astronomers think that binary neutron stars should also be common. Rotating binary neutron stars emit energy and gradually spiral inward towards each other, eventually merging. When they collide, a burst of gravitational waves is produced. Such a merger will also emit energy all across the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves to gamma rays. That is not true of a merger between black holes, the strong gravity of which prevents any electromagnetic radiation escaping. Though announced on October 16th, the latest gravitational wave was actually observed on August 17th. LIGO, and also Virgo, a detector in Italy, both saw a wave consistent with the merger of neutron stars with masses 1.1 and 1.6 times that of the sun. Those in charge soon found out that another telescopeâ€”the Gamma Ray Burst Monitor, aboard a satellite called the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescopeâ€”had picked up a short-lived burst of gamma rays from the same part of the sky two seconds later. Astronomers around the world then got to work, training other telescopes on the part of the sky the gamma-ray burst had come from and poring through data that had already been collected. Sure enough, optical telescopes pinned the event down within an hour to a galaxy called NGC 4993 (the fuzzy blob in the picture above), which is about 130m light-years away. A campaign over the next two weeks produced more observations in visible, ultraviolet and infrared light through a network of ground-based telescopes. X-ray and radio telescopes also saw the merger. The events in NGC 4993 were not, however, visible through every astronomical windowâ€”and that, in itself, is significant. Astronomers looked for the merger signal in two neutrino telescopes, IceCube (at the South Pole) and ANTARES (in the Mediterranean Sea), and in the Pierre Auger Observatory (in Argentina), which records the arrival of cosmic rays. None of these observatories saw anything. That, according to Szabolcs and Zsuzsanna Marka of Columbia University, in New York, two of the physicists involved in LIGO, could be because the merger just observed is at the weak end of gravitational-wave-producing events. Neutrinos (a type of extremely light, electrically neutral subatomic particle) would be produced in bulk only by more energetic collisions, as might cosmic rays, most of which are high-energy protons. The Drs Marka hope, though, that in the future LIGO will indeed detect such events, permitting them to be observed in four different ways, namely electromagnetically, gravitationally, and by their emissions of neutrinos and protons. For those behind LIGO, Virgo and other detectors now under construction, these are exciting times. In particular, neutron-star mergers are thought to be an important source of the heaviest chemical elements, such as gold, platinum and uranium. These are formed by the addition of neutrons (some of which then decay into protons) to lighter atomic nuclei. An explosive collision between neutron-rich bodies promotes this process. The arrival of gravitational-wave astronomy also shows the virtues of patience. Einstein, when he published general relativity, said that he did not expect that such waves would ever actually be detected. Many modern-day physicists make similarly pessimistic noises about some current ideas, such as string theory, saying these will remain forever in the realm of the hypothetical. Perhaps another century will prove them wrong, too.

economist,Oct 12th 2017,Offshore wind farms will change life in the sea," This will have consequences. Mussels eat plankton that they filter from the surrounding water. Dr Slavikâ€™s computer modelling suggests plankton numbers around wind farms could fall by as much as 10%. Since plankton are at the start of most marine food chains, that will mean less of them for other animals, such as anemones, scallops and jellyfish, and thus less of those species and others that in turn depend on them. It will, however, mean more food for species that eat mussels, of which there are manyâ€”starfish, seagulls, seals and, not least, people, especially Belgians, who have already set up an experimental mussel farm on one of their wind farms. Wind-farm piles may even increase the North Seaâ€™s biodiversity, by providing homes for species that do not currently live there. One such is the marine splash midge, a fly originally from Australia. After hitching a ride to Europe on ship hulls, it has been found flourishing just above sea level on the piles of Danish and Swedish wind farms. Whether local ecosystems will benefit from a new midge joining them remains to be seen. People, though, are unlikely to be inconvenienced. Unlike the midges that terrorise the Scottish Highlands, marine splash midges do not bite.

economist,Oct 12th 2017,One of the worldâ€™s oldest products faces the digital future," Gorilla Glassâ€™s unique selling point is not that it is tough, but that it stays tough when formed into sheets thin enough to protect the surfaces of the touchscreens of todayâ€™s increasingly skinny mobile devices without affecting those screensâ€™ function. That means permitting the circuits within a screen to locate the position of a finger placed on the surface. In many portable devices that is done by detecting a tiny change in an electrical charge across the screen at the point where the finger touches. Too thick a screen can make this change harder to detect. Since its launch, Gorilla Glass has been getting thinner and tougher still. According to Corning, a sheet less than 1mm thick, made of the fifth generation of the stuff (the latest iteration, released last year), can survive four times out of five if dropped facedown from a height of 1.6 metres (63 inches) onto a rough surface. As a consequence, Jobsâ€™ job was but the first of many. Gorilla Glass is now found in some 5bn smartphones, tablet computers, laptops and other devices produced by electronics companies around the world. It is beginning to appear in other things, too, including carsâ€”an ironic development, as the motor industry, one putative destination of the original version from the 1960s, had rejected it back then. Two tricks give Gorilla Glass its strength. One is its compositionâ€”or, rather, the way that composition is modified in the middle of the manufacturing process. The other is a detail of this process itself. The material starts off as a mixture of silica, aluminium oxide (a standard strengthening agent) and sodium oxide. This mix, once molten, is turned into a sheet using the â€œfusion drawâ€ù process, a technique pioneered by Corning. Fusion drawing involves pouring molten glass into a V-shaped trough and letting it overflow down the sides of that trough, clinging to them and running down them as treacle might cling to and run down the outside of a bowl. As the two streams of glass meet at the bottom of the V their inner surfaces fuse into a single, thin sheet. Because the outside surface of each stream has had no contact with a production surface, those surfaces do not pick up any contamination or other damage, and emerge flat and devoid of defects. Materials break at their weakest point. For a sheet of glass that is often an impurity, crack or scratch on its surface. Fusion drawing eliminates such weakness. The next stage, modifying the glassâ€™s composition to impart strength throughout its volume, involves immersing the fusion-drawn sheet in a hot bath of potassium salts. This results in a process called ion exchange, in which sodium ions within the glass are forced out and replaced by potassium ions from the bathing solution. Sodium and potassium are chemically similar, which is what permits this to happen. But potassium ions have about two-and-a-half times the volume of sodium ions. When the glass cools, this extra ionic volume compresses the material from the inside. That makes it more resilient to knocks and scrapes. Gorilla Glass dominates the market for cover glass for electronic equipment, but it faces rivals, including Dragontrail, a chemically toughened glass manufactured by Asahi Glass in Japan. This is made using the float-glass system, in which molten glass is floated onto a bed of molten metal. (The technique was invented in the 1950s by Pilkington, a British glassmaker which is now owned by NSG, a rival Japanese glassmaker.) Another potential competitor is sapphire glass, which is not really a glass at all, but rather a crystalline material that is a synthetic version of the eponymous gemstone. Sapphire glass is extremely hard and is used in some high-end watches, but it can be heavy and is more expensive than Gorilla Glassâ€”though researchers are trying to reduce both its weight and its cost. Corning, meanwhile, is pushing Gorilla Glass, and other specialist glasses made by fusion drawing, into more areas. According to Jeffrey Evenson, the firmâ€™s chief strategy officer, tough, lightweight glass opens up new possibilities for giant display screens and for use as part of the architecture of buildings. Entire walls and tabletops could become displays with touch-sensitive surfaces. Windows, too, will contain electronic layers, allowing their transparency to be tweaked as desiredâ€”and perhaps even permitting them to gather solar energy from non-visible frequencies, to generate electricity. Other types of glass will become more flexible, enabling portable devices to be bendable, or even foldable. One of the biggest areas for growth, Mr Evenson reckons, will be in cars. Already, instruments and switches on the dashboards of new cars are being replaced with touchscreens. As glass can be formed into different shapes, these screens can be curved into the contours of a vehicleâ€™s interior. But Gorilla Glass, or something like it, could also be employed to make car windows. These, being thinner than existing windows, would be lighter and thus save fuel (or, in a battery-powered car, electricity). A version of Gorilla Glass is already being used for the windscreen of Fordâ€™s GT sports car. Ford reckons the new glass is about 30% lighter than what it is replacing. It is also stronger, and scratch-resistant. Further ahead, electronics could be incorporated into the glass, to project images onto the windscreen, to assist drivers. Perhaps, one day, one of Gorilla Glassâ€™s descendants will be strong and tough enough to abolish the windscreen altogether, and replace it, the other windows and the roof with a single, transparent canopy. For drivers, while drivers there continue to be, that will improve visibility. And, if cars of the future really do become driverless, it will let everyone on board relax and enjoy the scenery.

economist,Oct 7th 2017,Researchers who change country produce more influential work," Dr Sugimotoâ€™s analysis does not, admittedly, show whether high citation is a result of moving country or merely a consequence of only the brightest and best making such moves. But the second paper, by Caroline Wagner of Ohio State University, in Columbus, and Koen Jonkers of the European Commissionâ€™s Joint Research Centre, in Brussels, suggests that these peripatetic individuals certainly do benefit the countries that host them. <img alt="""" class=""component-image__img blog-post-article-image blog-post-article-image__slim"" data-reactid=""480"" sizes=""(min-width: 600px) 640px, calc(100vw - 20px)"" src=""https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20171007_STC841.png"" srcset=""//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/200-width/20171007_STC841.png 200w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/300-width/20171007_STC841.png 300w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/400-width/20171007_STC841.png 400w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/640-width/20171007_STC841.png 640w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/800-width/20171007_STC841.png 800w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/1000-width/20171007_STC841.png 1000w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/1200-width/20171007_STC841.png 1200w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/1280-width/20171007_STC841.png 1280w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/1600-width/20171007_STC841.png 1600w""/> Dr Wagner and Dr Jonkers used regression analysis, a statistical technique, to look for correlations between a countryâ€™s spending on research and development (R&amp;D), the flow of scientists in and out of it, and the quality of the science produced by its researchers (as indicated by the number of citations they received). The pair discovered that places with large numbers of scientists coming and going did indeed produce papers that were more highly cited (see chart). They found no such relationship between a countryâ€™s R&amp;D spending and its scientific impact. High-spending countries produced more papers, but proportionately no more of the highly cited ones than countries which spent less. One notable outlier, the United States, was ranked highly for scientific impact by the analysis, despite scoring poorly on openness. But, compared with the others on the list, the United States is both huge and has a large home-grown scientific workforce that is mobile between the member states of the union. The best analogy to this that Dr Wagner and Dr Jonkers could come up with was the European Union. This has more people than the United States (510m compared with 320m), also permits unfettered travel between its members and, like the American federal government, has research programmes that provide cash for scientists from different institutions to collaborate. According to Dr Wagner and Dr Jonkers, EU scientists published around 40% of the top tenth of the worldâ€™s most-cited papers in 2014, while America produced around 35%. Per head, that is a victory for the Yankees. But the EUâ€™s share of those highly cited papers has risen since 2000, while Americaâ€™s is in decline. Many politicians have done a good deal of head-scratching over how to get the best scientific bang for their buck.

economist,Oct 7th 2017,Pollution from ships is changing maritime weather," Particle accelerator The most likely explanation is particulate pollution emitted by the ships using the shipping lanes. Marine diesel burned offshore is generally high in sulphur, and its combustion produces soluble oxides of that element which act as nuclei for the condensation of cloud-forming droplets. Typical marine clouds in unpolluted areas are composed of large droplets and do not rise to high altitude, but Dr Thornton and his team reckon that smaller droplets, of the sort that condense around oxides of sulphur, might more easily be carried upward by convectionâ€”forming, as they rose, into towering storm clouds that would act as nurseries of lightning bolts. As to what can be done about this extra lightning, change may already be in hand. At the moment, standard â€œbunkerâ€ù fuel has an average sulphur content of 2.7%. From 2020 that should fall to 0.5% if refiners and shipowners obey rules being introduced by the International Maritime Organisation, the body responsible for trying to impose order on the worldâ€™s shipping. Ships are also being sailed more efficiently, often by slowing them down, which reduces the amount of fuel consumed per nautical mile. That is how Maersk Lineâ€”one of the worldâ€™s biggest container-ship operatorsâ€”has cut its fleetâ€™s fuel consumption by 42% since 2007. On top of this, ship propulsion is becoming more efficient, as heat-recycling systems and new types of engine are introduced. In a few decades, therefore, the storminess of shipping lanes may have returned to normal. In the meantime, for any who may doubt humanityâ€™s ability to affect the weather, Dr Thorntonâ€™s work provides strong evidence that it can.

economist,Oct 26th 2017,Chinaâ€™s Communist Party has blessed the power of its leader," More yes-men If so, this would make a big difference to policy. Mr Xi has made influential enemies since his first term in office began in 2012, notably the allies and clients of the hundreds of thousands of influential officials he has punished or had arrested for corruption. He has complained repeatedly that lower-level officials are not following orders. Having oneâ€™s own Thought with a capital T should make it easier to override resistance because to go against Mr Xi would be to go against the partyâ€™s charter. But it raises the risk that underlings will tell Mr Xi only what they think he wants to hear. That could lead to bad decisions. Some will argue that revising the constitution this way does not add much to Mr Xiâ€™s power. Communists are supposed to toe the party line anyway. Deng had no need of a Thought or, as he posthumously ended up with, a Theory, in order to rule. Having a Thought named after him may perhaps help Mr Xi in his battles to come, rather than signal that he has won a war. At first glance, the composition of the new Standing Committee looks consistent with that interpretation. Only one of the five new members is a close ally of Mr Xi. Four of them are linked with organisations or factions usually regarded as his rivals. And Mr Xiâ€™s closest political friend, Wang Qishan, who served as his chief graft-buster, has retired (he is 69). Two members, Mr Li and Wang Yang (bottom row, left), a vice-premier, began their careers in the Communist Youth League. The league was once a route to higher things for many officials, including Mr Xiâ€™s immediate predecessor, Hu Jintao. But Mr Xi has called it arrogant and out of touch and closed down its school. So the inclusion of two former officials of the league is surprising. Wang Yangâ€™s background is especially intriguing. As party chief in Guangdong from 2007 to 2012, he was part of the great â€œcake debateâ€ù. He argued that market reforms should be used to make the economic cake bigger for everyone, a poke at statists who emphasised dividing the cake more fairly. Two other new members began their careers in Shanghai and are usually thought of as allies of Mr Huâ€™s predecessor, Jiang Zemin, who was party leader between 1989 and 2002, and before that the partyâ€™s boss in Shanghai. They are Han Zheng (bottom row, right), recently the cityâ€™s party chief, and Wang Huning (bottom, second from left), Mr Xiâ€™s speechwriter who is largely responsible not only for Xi Thought, but also for Mr Jiangâ€™s and Mr Huâ€™s ideological contributions (the â€œThree Representsâ€ù of Mr Jiang and Mr Huâ€™s â€œScientific Developmentâ€ù). Wang Huning will become the propaganda chiefâ€”the first person to do that job who has studied in America (Berkeley). The factional background of one new member, Zhao Leji (bottom, third from left), who will take over as head of the partyâ€™s anti-corruption agency, is unknown. That leaves only one new man who is known to be closely linked to Mr Xi. He is Li Zhanshu (top, right) the presidentâ€™s chief of staff. Mr Li and Mr Xi met in the 1980s when they were both county-level party chiefs in Hebei province near Beijing. In 2011, just before he became party leader, Mr Xi visited Guizhou, a south-western province which was then run by Mr Li. The two men are thought to have grown close during that trip. At the highest level, therefore, Mr Xi seems to have given sops to other groups. But that is not the whole story. Over the past few years, the president has built up a system of â€œleading small groupsâ€ùâ€”informal committees that link together the party and government bureaucracies. In practice Mr Xi exercises much power through these groups, which limit the authority of the Politburo Standing Committee. Four new members of the inner sanctum are members of such groups. That suggests they owe more to Mr Xi than might appear. Here they all are One level down, among the 18 other members of the Politburo, Mr Xiâ€™s allies and influence are clearly in evidence. Over half of them now have ties to the party leader, including two new members: Cai Qi, the capitalâ€™s party boss, and Chen Minâ€™er, the party leader of Chongqing, both of whom have enjoyed stellar careers under Mr Xi. <img alt="""" class=""component-image__img blog-post-article-image"" data-reactid=""487"" sizes=""(min-width: 600px) 640px, calc(100vw - 20px)"" src=""https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20171028_CNC089.png"" srcset=""//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/200-width/images/print-edition/20171028_CNC089.png 200w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/300-width/images/print-edition/20171028_CNC089.png 300w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/400-width/images/print-edition/20171028_CNC089.png 400w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/640-width/images/print-edition/20171028_CNC089.png 640w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/800-width/images/print-edition/20171028_CNC089.png 800w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/1000-width/images/print-edition/20171028_CNC089.png 1000w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/1200-width/images/print-edition/20171028_CNC089.png 1200w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/1280-width/images/print-edition/20171028_CNC089.png 1280w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/1600-width/images/print-edition/20171028_CNC089.png 1600w""/> The absence from the Standing Committee of any obvious successor to Mr Xi is striking. As president he is limited to two terms, ending in 2023. His job as party leader has no fixed duration, but according to precedent it should also end after two terms, in 2022. At this congress, Mr Xi would have been expected to signal a choice of someone to take over from him. Such a person would have had to be young enough to hold the party chiefdom until 2032, ie, by convention, someone born no earlier than 1960. But there is no one who qualifies in the new line-up. The youngest is Mr Zhao, the new anti-corruption chief, who was born in 1957. That does not preclude Mr Xi from naming a younger successor later in his term. But for now, there is no leader-in-waiting. The conclusion must be that even if Mr Xiâ€™s rivals remain influential in the Standing Committee, the president feels empowered to ignore precedent with impunity. The succession system had constrained his predecessors by forcing them to stick with choices made long before they stepped down. Mr Hu and Mr Jiang had to work with successors who had been foisted on them by party elders. By insisting on keeping the job open, Mr Xi has shown that he alone calls the shots. He may decide not to retire at all in 2022. With his name in the constitution, Mr Xi will be the final arbiter whether he has a formal position or not, since heâ€”along with Marx, Lenin, Mao and Dengâ€”now defines what it is to be a Communist. The congress has consolidated his authority not just for five years but, in effect, for life. Xi Thought updates the Theory invented by Deng, namely â€œSocialism with Chinese Characteristicsâ€ù. But it is clear that Mr Xi is no Dengist. In 1980 Deng argued that China should have a collective leadership, that too much power held by one person was bad for the country and that the party needed predictability in choosing its leaders. Deng was also the source of other party norms that have been followed for many years, such as those relating to retirement (Politburo members cannot have their five-year terms renewed if they are 68 or older) and a foreign-policy dictum that says China should â€œhide its capacities, bide its time and never take the lead.â€ù All but one of these precepts have been thrown out. The exception is that Mr Xi respected the rule on retirement ages in the Standing Committee. But ideas about collective leadership and predictability in succession are toast. The notion of hiding oneâ€™s capacities has taken another knock. A commentary published online by Peopleâ€™s Daily, the partyâ€™s flagship newspaper, said Mr Xiâ€™s thinking merited â€œthe attention of the entire worldâ€ù. Xinhua contrasted the vigour of Mr Xiâ€™s ideas with the problems of â€œdoddering democraciesâ€ù. So far, however, Mr Xi has offered few clues as to how his next five years (or more) in power will differ, if at all, from his first term. â€œGovernment, military, society and schools, north, south, east and westâ€”the party is the leader of all,â€ù Mr Xi told the congress. Ensuring it remains so is certain to remain an overwhelming priority.

economist,Oct 21st 2017,Chinaâ€™s leader Xi Jinping declares the start of a â€œnew eraâ€ù," Zero hour, Xi time Mr Xi stuck to a formulaic style, repeating oft-used phraseology. But there were significant differences, such as in the unlovely title of one section: â€œThoughts on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Eraâ€ù. Deng Xiaoping coined the clunky term â€œsocialism with Chinese characteristicsâ€ù in the 1980s. Mr Xiâ€™s contribution is the catchier bit, â€œnew eraâ€ù. China, he said, was at a â€œnew historic junctureâ€ù. The coming era would see it â€œmoving closer to centre stage and making greater contributions to mankindâ€ù. But achieving what he called the â€œChinese dreamâ€ùâ€”another of his catchphrasesâ€”would be â€œno walk in the parkâ€ù. He said it would â€œtake more than drum-beating and gong-clanging to get thereâ€ù. Mr Xi talked in some detail about a â€œtwo-stage development planâ€ù that will make China a â€œgreat modern socialist countryâ€ù in the era between now and 2050. According to this, China will become a global leader in innovation by 2035, with â€œrule of lawâ€ù in place and much greater â€œsoft powerâ€ù globally. In the 15 years after that, it will become â€œprosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced, harmonious and beautifulâ€ù. (Mr Xi does not mean democratic in the normal sense: he gave no hint that there would be any erosion whatever of the partyâ€™s control.) It is clear that Mr Xi wants to be seen as the founder of this new era. He mentioned the term 36 times in his speech. Even if it is not entirely clear what the new era will entail, the phrase has a better chance of taking off than the now largely forgotten contributions made by Mr Xiâ€™s two immediate predecessors to the partyâ€™s ideological lexicon: the â€œscientific outlook on developmentâ€ù of Hu Jintao, and the oddly named â€œThree Representsâ€ù of Jiang Zemin. Mr Xi described his new-era thoughts as â€œa compass for the party and peopleâ€ù. Peopleâ€™s Daily, the partyâ€™s main mouthpiece, hailed them as â€œthe latest achievement in adapting Marxism to the Chinese contextâ€ù. This implies that the term will be written into the partyâ€™s constitution during the congress. There is much speculation that Mr Xiâ€™s name will be attached to it, making him the first leader since Deng to be named in the document. Should the revised charter refer to â€œXi Jinping Thoughtâ€ù, then Mr Xi will become an ideologue on a par with Mao. The party has a hierarchy of words describing systems of ideas, with â€œthoughtâ€ù (sixiang) nearly at the top, â€œtheoryâ€ù (lilun) in the middle and â€œviewâ€ù or â€œperspectiveâ€ù (guan) at the bottom. Which word is used depends on how important the originator of the idea is considered to be. Mr Huâ€™s scientific development is a view. Even Dengâ€™s Chinese characteristics are just a theory. Only Mao, so far, has achieved thought. Messrs Hu and Jiang were sitting on either side of Mr Xi in the hall, applauding. But Mr Xiâ€™s new-era idea clearly eclipses any musings of theirs. The words for new era, xin shidai, come first when joined together with Dengâ€™s formulation. Old whine in new waffle Though Mr Xi talked about a new era, the next five years sound, from his speech, to be much like the past fiveâ€”only more so. To loud applause, he declared that the momentum behind his anti-corruption campaign was unstoppable. He talked about â€œstrengthening the partyâ€™s long-term governance capacityâ€ù (ie, involving it in more decisions) and boosting party organisations in companies, schools and villages. He stressed the need to â€œcorrect and resist various erroneous viewpointsâ€ù. It does not sound as if his persistent efforts to crush civil society will ease. As he has done in the past, he sent mixed signals on the economy. He talked about ensuring the â€œmarket-based allocationâ€ù of resources and â€œbusiness survival determined by competitionâ€ù. He spoke in similar terms in 2013, a year after he came to power. This time he also promised to â€œsupport state capital in becoming strongerâ€ù, just as he has been doing since then. Perhaps most important, he suggested there would be no let-up in his more assertive foreign policy. In his speech to the previous congress in 2012, Mr Hu had said the armyâ€™s job was â€œto win a local war in an information ageâ€ù. Mr Xi dropped the word local. He toughened up the language on Taiwan. Where Mr Hu had talked of opposing Taiwanese independence, Mr Xi threatened to destroy it. If he is under pressure to concentrate more on domestic matters, he has resisted it in his rhetoric. Attention now will focus on the people Mr Xi will put in place at the end of the congress to help him lead China into the new era he envisages. But whereas, after previous congresses, observers tried to work out the balance between reformers and conservatives in the new line-ups that emerged, few will be wasting much effort on such calculations this time. The central message of this event will be that Mr Xi is in absolute command; the new era will be his. That is a risky assertion in a country where many are prospering but many feel left out. In effect, Mr Xi has assumed responsibility for the way the coming era turns out.

economist,Oct 19th 2017,Chinaâ€™s food-delivery business is booming. So is waste," Most hotly debated of late is the impact the business is having on the environment. Each day about 65m meal-containers are discarded, by one estimate. Campaigners object to the unwanted cutlery, napkins and chopsticks that restaurants selling through online platforms habitually bundle with orders. The Green Volunteer League of Chongqing, a Chinese NGO, says that food-delivery sites have not made it easy enough for customers to refuse such sundries (the big companies deny this). In September a court in Beijing agreed to examine whether they have violated consumersâ€™ rights. There would be much less reason to worry about the mountains of waste if households and local governments did a better job of keeping recyclables separate from gunk. This year the central government ordered 46 cities to come up with new systems for sorting rubbish, which it talks of making mandatory by 2020. That is progress, but only if it is unwavering: over the years officials have found several similar campaigns all too easy to throw out.

economist,Oct 19th 2017,"If you think protest is finished in Hong Kong, think again"," Many Hong Kongers with democratic leanings think that, by antagonising the party, the protests harmed Hong Kongâ€™s interests. A return to the street gridlock of three years ago would certainly anger many ordinary people trying to go about their daily lives. There is considerable public disdain for the growing stridency of some pro-democracy campaigners. Before he went to jail, even one of the student organisers, Joshua Wong, told The Economist that Hong Kong was suffering from protest fatigue. Yet this is not the end of the matter. For one thing, the central government appears blind to the effect its hard line is having in Hong Kong. The growth in pro-independence feeling appears to be a reaction to Hong Kongâ€™s constricted political space, and to a sense that the territoryâ€™s own uniqueness is being undermined. The authorities should worry that the generation of Hong Kongers with the strongest sense of â€œlocalismâ€ù is the one that has grown up only under Chinese rule. The polling is thin, but suggests that perhaps more than half of university students believe that democracy is impossible under â€œone country, two systemsâ€ù, Chinaâ€™s formula for Hong Kong. They see independence as the solution. Banners calling for it appeared on campuses at the start of the university term in September. Football fans boo when the national anthem is played at matches in Hong Kong. It is therefore only a matter of time before there is another clash of wills between the party and Hong Kongâ€™s people. Already there are rumblings of one: when the pro-independence banners were removed from campuses, many students complained about infringement of their right to free speech. Ms Lam, perhaps sensibly, steered clear of sensitive political issues in her first policy address on October 11th. Ominously, parts of the mainlandâ€™s state-run media are calling for Hong Kong to enact anti-sedition laws, as the territoryâ€™s government is required to under Article 23 of the post-colonial constitution. When it tried to do so in 2003, hundreds of thousands took to the streets in protest, leading to the laws being shelved and to the early departure of the then chief executive. Then, the lawsâ€™ opponents were branded in Beijing as pesky democrats. Were Ms Lam to revive such attempts, opponents would be condemned not simply as democrats but as dangerous separatists. The scene would be set for an ugly stand-off. During the Occupy unrest Chinaâ€™s leader, Xi Jinping, declared the protests â€œillegalâ€ù, but left Hong Kong to deal with them. Next time, with the stakes higher, he may take a more aggressive approach. The golden thread Chinese officials urge Hong Kong to return to being an â€œeconomicâ€ù city. Whatever that means: the idea of an apathetic populace interested only in material gain is fanciful. A long and admirable history shows Hong Kongers persistently demanding more say in their affairsâ€”starting under colonial rule in the 1960s and 1970s when they organised against poor living conditions, inferior education and rampant corruption. Stephen Vines, a local commentator, speaks of a â€œgolden threadâ€ù that runs through these early protests to the more recent ones. Mr Xi hasnâ€™t heard the last of Hong Kong. Those who were politically baptised during the Occupy movement will be around longer than he will.

economist,Oct 12th 2017,"Despite its reputation, Chinese aid is quite effective"," Previous AidData studies of Chinese aid have been controversial. In 2013 the researchers reckoned that aid to Africa alone (which accounts for half of Chinaâ€™s total foreign aid) was $75bn between 2000 and 2011. Deborah Brautigam of Johns Hopkins University in Maryland said their calculation was â€œway offâ€ù. She criticised what she described as its excessive reliance on unreliable news reports. AidDataâ€™s new estimate appears to be better grounded. It is based more on official announcements from Chinese commercial offices abroad and from the finance and planning ministries of recipient countries. The authors use their new numbers to look at whether Chinese aid worksâ€”an equally controversial subject. In a study published along with the data set, researchers including Bradley Parks of the College of William and Mary find that the grant kind does. They reckon a doubling of Chinese grant aid is associated with a 0.4-point increase in the rate of GDP growth of the recipients after two years. That is more than can be said for Chinaâ€™s no-strings-attached concessional lending, which, according to AidData, has no effect on the receiving countryâ€™s GDP. It appears to be tantamount to an export subsidy to Chinese firms, with a side order of backhanders for local elites. On a happier note, the study looks at whether Chinese aid damages Western assistance. The researchers do this by calculating whether aid effectiveness declines in countries that receive Western aid and then get an influx of Chinese cash. It finds no decline, implying Chinese aid does not harm efforts by other donors. Three conclusions can be drawn from AidDataâ€™s findings. First, Chinese aid could do more good in poor countries if more of it came in the form of grants, rather than cheap loans. Next, Western aid agencies should not be so wary of co-operating with the Chinese. Co-ordination is important in aid-giving because otherwise you might find, say, three aid agencies each building a hospital in the same city. Because China is regarded as a rogue, it is not roped into the co-ordination efforts among Western donors. That should change. Lastly, the paucity of information about Chinaâ€™s aid (despite AidDataâ€™s efforts) is caused by the opacity of Chinaâ€™s government. Perhaps it might consider being more open about a programme that appears, for all its flaws, to be moderately effective.

economist,Oct 12th 2017,Chinaâ€™s yuppies want schools to be more laid-back," Another fad is for education that is directly inspired by ancient Chinese culture, often delivered by small schools in the countryside that offer instruction in subjects such as archery, traditional medicine and Confucianism. Some have only a handful of full-time students, but also run popular workshops and summer schools. (Not all their patrons want touchy-feely education: at the far fringes of this movement are schools that require students to do little besides memorising classical literary and philosophical texts, as their ancestors might once have done.) A few parents who want to free their children from the state systemâ€™s stifling constraints, but who can find no handy alternative, are trying home schooling instead. A survey published this year by the 21st Century Education Research Institute, a think-tank in China, found only about 6,000 families educating their children exclusively at homeâ€”still a tiny number, but one that is rising by around one-third each year, the institute reckons. Rules bent and broken The national curriculum, which is compulsory for children in the first nine years of school (ie, aged between six and 15), allows some room for experimentation. Primary schools can usually find time to supplement mandatory material with some of their own choosing, says Jiang Xueqin, a researcher and consultant. Motivated teachers can deliver the obligatory stuff in unconventional ways. But some of the progressive schools pay only lip service to the stateâ€™s curriculum. Some of them obtain government approval to operate as schools. But others affiliate themselves with licensed schools to avoid the tricky process of having to get their own permits. Many smaller institutions get by without official blessing. Better-off parents appear unfazed by the lack of proper paperwork for some progressive schools (the Waldorf in Chengdu has licences for its nursery and primary schools, but the authorities want it to find a bigger campus before they will issue a permit for its secondary school). However, some worry about the later years of their childrenâ€™s schooling. Parents who want their offspring to study abroad can safely keep them in progressive schools. Those who want them to cram for the national entrance exam for universities in China, or gaokao, often choose to move them back into conventional schools for that period of study. Few parents want to take risks with a potentially life-changing test. The government itself sees benefit in having well-educated youngsters who are self-starting and creativeâ€”the kind of people needed to build a more innovative economy. In the early 2000s it began encouraging schools to make lessons more lively and textbooks more varied. Yet the gaokao system continues to give schools a strong incentive to stuff their students with stodgy facts. Parents deplore the pressure that the gaokao imposes. But they also distrust less objective types of assessment, which may be prone to corruption. The Communist Party has reservations about non-mainstream schooling. It frets that some unlicensed schools may be peddling unsavoury ideologies or religions, such as Christianity or Islam. A government circular issued in February reminded parents that taking lessons at home or attending traditional-culture schools was no substitute for attendance at state-approved institutions during the period of compulsory education. It is highly unlikely that the government will ban progressive schools. Too many wealthy parents want them, and keeping the middle class happy is one of the partyâ€™s priorities. But officials are wary of giving schools too much latitude. This year they imposed limits on the number of translated childrenâ€™s books by foreign authors that are published in China. They are also trying harder to ensure that private schools have active party committees. If such efforts discourage experimentation, Chinese children will be the losers.

economist,Oct 28th 2017,Time for Japanâ€™s prime minister to change the constitution," Mr Abe has taken his win as a mandate to press ahead with his long-standing plan to revise Japanâ€™s pacifist constitution. This is a sensible goal. As it stands, the document is impossible to take literally. Imposed on Japan by the victorious Americans after the second world war, it says, in Article 9, that â€œthe Japanese people forever renounce...the threat or use of force as a means of settling international disputes.â€ù For this reason, â€œland, sea and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained.â€ù For more than seven decades Japan has flagrantly violated its own constitution by maintaining land, sea and air forces. Its military budget is the eighth-largest in the world. Its 300,000 troops are superbly equipped. Successive governments have clung to the fiction that this is somehow constitutional by using the label of â€œself-defence forcesâ€ù. As legal camouflage goes, this is like trying to hide a tank by sticking a Post-it note on it. Mr Abe is right to want to make clear in the constitution that Japan may, in fact, maintain armed forces. The rule of law matters, and is undermined when the government nakedly disobeys its principles. What is more, decades of double-talk over Article 9 have muddled the debate that Japan ought to be having over what role it should play in maintaining regional and global security. Every time a Japanese government tries to do more to help its allies, or to contribute more to UN peacekeeping operations, pacifists cry â€œunconstitutionalâ€ù. Most of the time they are right, and even if they are overruled, they usually delay things. Until last year Japanâ€™s military forces were barred from helping allies who came under attack in its backyard. Japanâ€™s UN peacekeeping forays are a joke. Its troops in Iraq had to be protected by Australian forces, because they were not allowed to shoot back at militants who attacked their base. This year Japanese UN peacekeepers pulled out of South Sudan after it was revealed that the war-ravaged African country was, yes, a bit dangerous. In July Mr Abeâ€™s defence minister had to resign for allegedly covering up this well-known fact. Changing Article 9 will not be easy. First, Mr Abe must come up with wording that can gain a two-thirds majority in both houses of the Diet, which means winning over several of his more doveish colleagues. The revision must then win a simple majority in a referendum, which may be a struggle. China and North and South Korea will protest loudly if Japan revises Article 9, claiming that this is a step back towards the Japanese militarism that devastated East Asia in the 1930s and 1940s. This is bunk. Like any state, Japan has a right to defend itself. As a rich, mature democracy, it should also be doing its bit to keep the world safer. With its elderly, shrinking population and ingrained pacifism, Japan is no threat to anyone. Alas, Mr Abe himself often creates the opposite impression. If he wants constitutional change and to reduce opposition abroad, he should stop visiting the Yasukuni shrine, where war criminals are worshipped; denounce the atrocities of the past; and distance himself from his grandfather, a post-war prime minister and colonial administrator who forced thousands of Chinese to work as slaves. For Japan truly to become a normal power, it needs to come to terms with its history.

economist,Oct 26th 2017,The Bank of England should wait before raising rates," One reason is that the Brexit threat is not yet over. Theresa May, the prime minister, wants a transitional arrangement which seeks to preserve the status quo while a formal deal is thrashed out. But getting one may be harder than she thinks (see article). Crunch time is the European Unionâ€™s December summit. It would be needlessly risky for the bank to shake up monetary policy beforehand. Better to wait until January, when it will be clearer whether Mrs Mayâ€™s hopes are well-founded. Another reason is that the British economy is not exactly overheating. True, consumer-price inflation has exceeded the bankâ€™s target for months. Yet higher inflation is largely a consequence of sterlingâ€™s depreciation following last yearâ€™s referendum. Even if the bank did nothing, inflation would be down again before long, as exchange-rate effects faded. Inflation hawks point out that the rate of GDP growth is above the economyâ€™s potential and that, at 4.3%, unemployment is low by historical standards even as the employment rate is near a historical high. However, though wage growth is edging up, it remains about 2% a year, suggesting that either a surprising amount of slack remains in the labour market or low unemployment does not produce as much inflationary pressure as it used to. Some hawks also argue that higher interest rates will benefit households by dissuading them from borrowing imprudently. Although householdsâ€™ balance-sheets look fairly healthy on aggregate, a large number of Britons, especially poorer ones, do indeed have high levels of debt. However, the bank can deal with that more effectively using macroprudential tools, rules to reduce financial instability by ensuring that lending is judicious. And the British economy is highly sensitive to increases in interest rates (see article). Roughly 40% of mortgages have a variable interest rate, so they are heavily influenced by the base rate. Even fixed-rate mortgages typically need frequent refinancing. Compare that with America, where over eight in ten mortgages are fixed-rate, generally for a lot longer. Many householdsâ€™ finances may be able to afford higher rates. But there is uncertainty about how they would react to the first interest-rate rise in a decade. Even if the MPC tried to reassure Britons that monetary policy would remain loose, many might behave as if rates were likely to rise further. If they cut spending sharply, the economy would suffer. The problem facing the MPC is that, having talked up the possibility of rate rises, its members have boxed themselves in. If the bank does keep rates on hold on November 2nd, it is sure to face criticism for having given out mixed messages. So be it. Waiting a bit too long before tightening will do little damage; tightening too early could do a lot.

economist,Oct 26th 2017,A bad election is worse than a delayed one," Start with the bad loser. Mr Odinga withdrew from the race on October 10th. He has been careful not to call for violence, but nor has he dispelled the view that the only way to prevent it would be to offer him unreasonable concessions. He has rejected seeking further redress in the courts, arguing that the crisis is a political one and requires a political solution. Mr Kenyatta has been more irresponsible still. Parliament has passed laws to restrict the powers of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) and the courts. Before the election on August 8th, it deported foreign experts hired by the opposition to monitor the electronic-vote count. The government argues that it is constitutionally bound to press ahead with the vote; postponing it would be illegal and reward the menacing actions of Mr Odingaâ€™s supporters. But in pushing for the re-run, Mr Kenyattaâ€™s supporters appear to be doing some menacing of their own. Barely a week before the vote, Roselyn Akombe, an IEBC commissioner, fled to America saying her life was in danger. Her boss, Wafula Chebukati, said that the commission had degenerated into warring factions and that candidates were intimidating his staff. â€œUnder such conditions, it is difficult to guarantee free, fair and credible elections,â€ù he said. Given the chaos, the courts would surely order a postponement. But when the petition to do just that was put before the Supreme Court, only two of the seven judges turned up. One had an excuse: the night before the hearing Ms Mwiluâ€™s bodyguard was shot. Another justice said she had missed her flight to Nairobi. Denied a quorum, the court could not hear the case. The worst part is that the crisis is self-defeating. Mr Kenyatta would probably win a proper election. Instead this weekâ€™s pyrrhic victory will come at the price of his legitimacy. For the sake of his country, and to assuage his seething opponents, he should promise to run a credible election, perhaps early next year. If he wins fairly, Mr Kenyatta could yet become the proud president of an improving democracy. Right now, he is fast leading the country back to autocracy.

economist,Oct 26th 2017,The age of Amazon and Alibaba is just beginning," Through one lens, this is a boon for competition. The e-commerce sites of Amazon and Alibaba lower barriers to entry by providing a simpler, cheaper way for small manufacturers to distribute goods and find potential buyers. Local manufacturers are challenging multinational giants. Consumers benefit, as they can choose from more and better products than ever. Yet as the giant e-commerce platforms grow, so does unease about their might. With access to cheap, patient capital, Amazon can make big investments, including in warehouses, artificial intelligence and other firms such as Whole Foods, a grocer it bought for $13.7bn this year. Those investments, combined with the vast amounts of data on the consumers and businesses on its platform, mean that competitors struggle to keep up. Amazonâ€™s challengers should learn from China, where Alibabaâ€™s rivals are teaming up. Tencent began as a gaming and messaging company. It now has a thriving digital-payments business and is the biggest shareholder in JD.com, Alibabaâ€™s closest e-commerce competitor. JD is working with other retailers and tech firms, too. In August it announced that shoppers could buy through Baidu, Chinaâ€™s leading search engine. Amazonâ€™s would-be competitors might follow a similar path, by forging partnerships. Walmart (another investor in JD), for example, seems to be adopting JDâ€™s tactics, making its products available through Googleâ€™s voice assistant to counter Amazonâ€™s Alexa. Facebook wants to make it easier for customers to buy goods featured in its ads. And Google, to the horror of some privacy advocates, is tracking consumers to help bricks-and-mortar shops see which online ads work. American firms may yet catch up with their Chinese counterparts. Will that be enough to guarantee competition? Regulators must be vigilant. More mergers are now likely among both makers of consumer goods and retailers, as they seek the heft to battle Amazon. Deals between retailers and tech firms will complicate matters further. Watch the giants In antitrust cases Americaâ€™s courts have tended to assume that new entrepreneurs would challenge profitable incumbents. But in America venture-capital funding for e-commerce firms is dropping, in part because investors think Amazon will be dominant. This newspaper has argued that regulators should weigh the effect of mergers on the control of data as well as market shareâ€”especially for Amazon, given its existing power and range. Antitrust rules, as with so much else in the Amazon era, look as if they will need updating.

economist,Oct 26th 2017,A tsar is born," Mr Putin is hardly the worldâ€™s only autocrat. Personalised authoritarian rule has spread across the world over the past 15 yearsâ€”often, as with Mr Putin, built on the fragile base of a manipulated, winner-takes-all democracy. It is a rebuke to the liberal triumphalism which followed the collapse of the Soviet Union. Leaders such as Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey (see article), the late Hugo ChÃ¡vez of Venezuela and even Narendra Modi, Indiaâ€™s prime minister, have behaved as if they enjoy a special authority derived directly from the popular will. In China Xi Jinping this week formalised his absolute command of the Communist Party (see article). Mr Putinâ€™s brand of authoritarianism blazed the trail. It evokes Russiaâ€™s imperial history (see Briefing), offering a vivid picture of how power works and how it might go wrong. Like a tsar, Mr Putin surmounts a pyramid of patronage. Since he moved against the oligarchs in 2001, taking control first of the media and then of the oil and gas giants, all access to power and money has been through him. These days the boyars serve at his pleasure, just as those beneath them serve at their pleasure and so on all the way down. He wraps his power in legal procedure, but everyone knows that the prosecutors and courts answer to him. He enjoys an approval rating of over 80% partly because he has persuaded Russians that, as an aide says, â€œIf there is no Putin, there is no Russia.â€ù Like a tsar, too, he has faced the question that has plagued Russiaâ€™s rulers since Peter the Greatâ€”and which acutely confronted Alexander III and Nicholas II in the run-up to the revolution. Should Russia modernise by following the Western path towards civil rights and representative government, or should it try to lock in stability by holding fast against them? Mr Putinâ€™s answer has been to entrust the economy to liberal-minded technocrats and politics to former KGB officers. Inevitably, politics has dominated economics and Russia is paying the price. However well administered during sanctions and a rouble devaluation, the economy still depends too heavily on natural resources. It can manage annual GDP growth of only around 2%, a far cry from 2000-08, which achieved an oil-fired 5-10%. In the long run, this will cramp Russiaâ€™s ambitions. And like a tsar, Mr Putin has buttressed his power through repression and military conflict. At home, in the name of stability, tradition and the Orthodox religion, he has suppressed political opposition and social liberals, including feminists, NGOs and gays. Abroad, his annexation of Crimea and the campaigns in Syria and Ukraine have been burnished for the evening news by a captive, triumphalist media. However justified, the Westâ€™s outrage at his actions underlined to Russians how Mr Putin was once again asserting their countryâ€™s strength after the humiliations of the 1990s. What does this post-modern tsar mean for the world? One lesson is about the Russian threat. Since the interference in Ukraine, the West has worried about Russian revanchism elsewhere, especially in the Baltic states. But Mr Putin cannot afford large numbers of casualties without also losing legitimacy, as happened to Nicholas II in the Russo-Japanese war of 1904-05 and in the first world war. Because todayâ€™s tsar knows history, he is likely to be opportunistic abroad, shadowboxing rather than risking a genuine confrontation. The situation at home is different. In his time in power Mr Putin has shown little appetite for harsh repression. But Russiaâ€™s record of terrible suffering suggests that, whereas dithering undermines the rulerâ€™s legitimacy, mass repression can strengthen itâ€”at least for a time. The Russian people still have something to fear. Mother Russiaâ€™s offspring The other lesson is about succession. The October revolution is just the most extreme recent case of power in Russia passing from ruler to ruler through a time of troubles. Mr Putin cannot arrange his succession using his bloodline or the Communist Party apparatus. Perhaps he will anoint a successor. But he would need someone weak enough for him to control and strong enough to see off rivalsâ€”an unlikely combination. Perhaps he will try to cling to power, as Deng Xiaoping did behind the scenes as head of the China Bridge Association, and Mr Xi may intend to overtly, having conspicuously avoided naming a successor after this weekâ€™s party congress. Yet, even if Mr Putin became the Ã©minence grise of the Russian Judo Federation, it would only delay the fatal moment. Without the mechanism of a real democracy to legitimise someone new, the next ruler is likely to emerge from a power struggle that could start to tear Russia apart. In a state with nuclear weapons, that is alarming. The stronger Mr Putin is today, the harder he will find it to manage his succession. As the world tries to live with that paradox, it should remember that nothing is set in stone. A century ago the Bolshevik revolution was seen as an endorsement of Marxâ€™s determinism. In the event, it proved that nothing is certain and that history has its own tragic irony.",https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21730645-world-marks-centenary-october-revolution-russia-once-again-under-rule
economist,Oct 21st 2017,Not nearly enough is being done for the Rohingyas fleeing Myanmar," And even supposing that the government is sincere in its offer to bring the Rohingyas home, and that the army allows it to do so, the process will clearly take some time. Bangladesh and Myanmar are already arguing about whether the UN should be involved. After a bout of violence sent hundreds of thousands of Rohingyas to Bangladesh in 1991-92, it took five years to repatriate even a portion of those who wished to return. Myanmarâ€™s shame All this suggests that there will be huge numbers of Rohingyas in Bangladesh for a long time to come. Outsiders should exert whatever pressure they can on the Burmese army and government to stop the atrocities and allow the Rohingyas home. So far, the rebukes have been absurdly mild. This week, for example, the EU ruled out future visits to Europe by senior Burmese officers, and delayed a trade mission. Meanwhile, a concerted effort to make the refugeesâ€™ lives more bearable will also be needed. Donors should funnel more money and aid workers to the camps. The government of Bangladesh should give Rohingyas more freedom to make a better life for themselves in exile. They should be allowed to take formal work, for example, and to study at local schools and universities. It would be heaping one injustice on another to ignore the refugeesâ€™ long-term needs in the almost certainly forlorn hope that they will soon be back where they belong.

economist,Oct 21st 2017,Breaking the spell of Peronism," Mr Macri has made mistakes. He dealt ineptly with allegations that, thanks to his influence, his father got a sweetheart deal to repay a debt to the government. But the economic medicine is beginning to work. After a recession last year, growth has recovered and inflation has fallen by nearly 15 percentage points from its peak of almost 40%. The poverty rate has dropped from 32% last year to 29%. Letâ€™s not change In primaries held in August, a guide to partiesâ€™ popularity, Cambiemos soundly beat parties allied to Ms FernÃ¡ndez. If it repeats that performance it will gain seats in both houses of congress, though it will have a majority in neither. Mr Macri will then be better able to strike deals with Peronists who are more moderate than Ms FernÃ¡ndez. This would be a result worth celebrating. It would show that voters will back tough decisions if they deliver results. That would help Mr Macri proceed with plans to cut the budget deficit, liberalise labour laws and clean up the courts. It would break the spell of Ms FernÃ¡ndezâ€™s ruinous Peronism. That may be the biggest prize of all.

economist,Oct 21st 2017,The right way to help declining places," Divergence is the result of big forces. In the modern economy scale is increasingly important. The companies with the biggest hoards of data can train their machines most effectively; the social network that everyone else is on is most attractive to new users; the stock exchange with the deepest pool of investors is best for raising capital. These returns to scale create fewer, superstar firms clustered in fewer, superstar places. Everywhere else is left behind. Even as regional disparities widen, people are becoming less mobile. The percentage of Americans who move across state lines each year has fallen by half since the 1990s. The typical American is more footloose than the average European, yet lives less than 30 kilometres from his parents. Demographic shifts help explain this, including the rise in two-earner households and the need to care for ageing family members. But the bigger culprit is poor policies. Soaring housing costs in prosperous cities keep newcomers out. In Europe a scarcity of social housing leads people to hang on to cheap flats. In America the spread of state-specific occupational licensing and government benefits punishes those who move. The pension of a teacher who stays in the same state could be twice as big as that of a teacher who moves mid-career. Perversely, policies to help the poor unintentionally exacerbate the plight of left-behind places. Unemployment and health benefits enable the least employable people to survive in struggling places when once they would have had no choice but to move. Welfare makes capitalism less brutal for individuals, but it perpetuates the problems where they live. Welcome to the place age What to do? One answer is to help people move. Thriving places could do more to build the housing and infrastructure to accommodate newcomers. Accelerating the reciprocal recognition of credentials across state or national borders would help people move to where they can be most productive. But greater mobility also has a perverse side-effect. By draining moribund places of talented workers, it exacerbates their troubles. The local tax-base erodes as productive workers leave, even as welfare and pension obligations mount. To avoid these outcomes, politicians have long tried to bolster left-behind places with subsidies. But such â€œregional policiesâ€ù have a patchy record, at best. South Carolina lured BMW to the state in 1992 and from it built a thriving automotive cluster. But the EUâ€™s structural funds raise output and reduce unemployment only so long as funding continues. California has 42 enterprise zones. None has raised employment. Better for politicians to focus on speeding up the diffusion of technology and business practices from high-performing places. A beefed-up competition policy could reduce industrial concentration, which saps the economy of dynamism while focusing the gains from growth in fewer firms and places. Fostering clusters by encouraging the creation of private investment funds targeted on particular regions might help. Bolder still would be to expand the mission of local colleges. In the 19th century America created lots of public technical universities. They were supposed to teach best practice to farmers and factory managers in small towns and rural areas. They could play that role again today for new technologies, much as Germany already has a network of applied-research institutions. Politicians might even learn from Amazon, whose search for a home for a second headquarters has set off a scramble among cities hoping to lure the giant etailer. Governments could award public research centresâ€”in the mould of Americaâ€™s National Institutes of Health or Europeâ€™s CERNâ€”to cities which prepare the best plans for policy reform and public investment. This would aid the diffusion of new ideas and create an incentive for struggling places to help themselves. Perhaps most of all, politicians need a different mindset. For progressives, alleviating poverty has demanded welfare; for libertarians, freeing up the economy. Both have focused on people. But the complex interaction of demography, welfare and globalisation means that is insufficient. Assuaging the anger of the left-behind means realising that places matter, too.

economist,Oct 21st 2017,"As Donald Trump blusters, Iran is reshaping the Arab world"," The Kurds deserve much sympathy. Denied a state in the carve-up of the Middle East, and massacred with poison gas by Saddam Hussein, they consolidated their autonomous region after America toppled Saddam in 2003. When the Iraqi army collapsed before the IS onslaught in 2014, the Kurds fought back valiantly with Western help, and occupied Kirkuk. Of late, though, Masoud Barzani, the Kurdish leader, has proved to be contemptuous of democracy (his mandate expired two years ago), and the fall in oil prices has bankrupted his government. His referendum was a reckless gamble to fend off dissatisfaction with his Kurdistan Democratic Party. Many Kurds, particularly in the other big faction, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, were wary. Iraqâ€™s prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, demanded that the referendum result be reversed. Iran and Turkey joined him in squeezing the Kurds. America, the Kurdsâ€™ protector, opposed the referendum, and American-trained units helped recapture Kirkukâ€”to the fury of congressmen who believe the operation was orchestrated by Iran. America has to step in to stop a new conflict in Iraq, between Shia Arabs and Kurds, taking root amid the rubble of the old one between Shia and Sunni Arabs. It will need great skill to help resolve the dispute over lands claimed by the governments in Erbil and Baghdad, and more broadly, to settle the question about how Iraq should be run. This will set a precedent for ending the war in Syria, determine the chances of jihadists returning and affect the regional power balance. To a degree, America needs Mr Abadi to be a strong Iraqi nationalist, the better to resist Iranian influence. But an over-mighty government in Baghdad would risk repeating the oppression of the Saddam era. Iraq needs a decentralised state that gives its minorities safety, and a fair share of power and resources. A thriving Kurdistan is the first step. America stands back Mr Trumpâ€™s preference for bluster over complex diplomacy or, worse, â€œnation-buildingâ€ù, adds to the perils. On October 13th he pledged to confront â€œthe rogue regime in Iranâ€ù, blaming Barack Obamaâ€™s nuclear deal for strengthening it. In fact, Iran derives its power mostly from the regionâ€™s chaos. Granted, confronting Iran on the ground is risky; it knows how to use proxy militias to bleed American troops. But Mr Trumpâ€™s blowhard talk risks provoking Iranian hardliners anyway. Right now, having done much to crush the jihadists in Iraq and Syria, America is letting Iran reshape the Arab world to its liking.

economist,Oct 21st 2017,The capitalist case against sexual harassment," Such dismissiveness is rarer now (see article). Most men and women agree that demanding sexual favours in return for a job or promotion is harassment; likewise groping and other physical assaults. But disturbingly many men are still blind to the way that personal remarks, lewd jokes and the like can make a workplace hostile. Though most rich countries ban sexual harassment at work, half of all women and a tenth of men say they have suffered it at some point; hardly any make formal complaints. In poor countries, the rate is surely higher, since women whose children are hungry cannot plausibly quit a job with an abusive boss. No industry is immune. The key elements are power, misused by predatory men; impunity, as those who could call a halt do not; and silence, as witnesses look away and victims fear that speaking up will harm their careers. If firms are serious about stopping harassment, they will need to tackle all three. The allegations against Mr Weinstein are unusual only in degree, not kind. Power in Hollywood is held by big-name producers and directors; their ability to turn a script into a blockbuster buys the complicity of their entourage. The unknowns desperate for their big break are easy prey. In Silicon Valley investors and boards have a huge incentive to overlook bad behaviour by men whose ideas can be worth billions. Star professors attract research funding and help universities rise in global rankings; graduate students rely on their references when scrambling for a job. The internships and staff jobs that can launch a career in Washington or Westminster are in the gift of politicians. Their only check is voters, who may neither know nor care how badly they act behind closed doors. Women in manual jobs are also vulnerable. When a hotel cleaner or waitress is grabbed by a customer, her boss may look away rather than lose a client. Multinationals that require their suppliers to keep premises safe and root out slave labour are generally silent on sexual harassment. The victims often suffer depression, anger and humiliation. Firms where harassment happens are eventually harmed, too. Mr Weinsteinâ€™s studio may be sued (see article). The company could even be destroyed by the scandal. Even if one leaves aside all moral argumentsâ€”which one should notâ€”failing to deal with harassment is usually bad for business. Firms that tolerate it will lose female talent to rivals that do not, and the market will punish them. The costs of decency are trivial; the rewards to shareholders are large. Granted, there will always be star employees who wish to abuse their power. But that power need not go unchecked. Firms should ask about harassment in anonymous â€œclimate surveysâ€ù to ensure that they get early notice of problems. Making a complaint should be straightforward. It should be handled quickly and proportionately. A first complaint about unwelcome remarks or a creepily tactile style merits a warning. A man who meant no harm will be mortified, and stop. For the most serious cases, the law will be needed. Some are not fit for purpose. British employment tribunals take a dim view of a woman who waits more than three months to complain, and regard cordial communications with her alleged harasser as undermining her case. But neither delay nor politeness at work mean she is lying: it is rational to worry about retaliation, and anyone who wants to keep her job cannot sulk. Such obstacles to justice should be removed. Firms need to take care that, in their zeal, they do not make matters worse. The no-dating policies common in America are intrusive, useless and have perverse consequences. People sometimes fall in love with colleagues. When firms require one half of an office couple to quit, it is usually the woman, who is typically younger and earns less. That is unfair. Likewise, an atmosphere in which senior men are wary of mentoring young women for fear of being misunderstood hurts womenâ€™s careers. Perfunctory anti-harassment training, which is also common, can put employeesâ€™ backs up and, if it uses absurd examples, can even make them less sympathetic towards victims and less likely to see borderline cases as wrong. Dinosaur-free zone Until surprisingly recently, racist and homophobic remarks were rife in the workplace. Now they are rare, and likely to be challenged by anyone who hears them. If sexual harassment is to be stopped, it needs to be called out in the same wayâ€”not just by the victims, but by all those who witness it.

economist,Oct 14th 2017,Theresa May should clear out her cabinet," That chaos has been encouraged by Boris Johnson, who published his own 4,000-word Brexit manifesto in a newspaper days before a big speech last month by the prime minister, and drew up â€œred linesâ€ù in an interview afterwards which flatly contradicted the governmentâ€™s position. The foreign secretaryâ€™s disloyalty is hardly offset by his skills as a diplomat. He is ridiculed abroad and disliked in the Foreign Office. Until recently he gave the impression of wanting to be sacked, the better to mount a leadership bid. But now even Brexiteer Tory MPs have tired of him. Mrs May should cut him loose. She should not stop there. The cabinet is stuffed with has-beens and never-weres, who achieved little even when the government had a majority. Chris Grayling, Andrea Leadsom and Priti Patel are among those ripe for relegation to the backbenches. Purging ministers who voted for Brexit would provoke calls to even things up by sacking some Remainers. A campaign is being waged to unseat Philip Hammond, the competent chancellor, who favours a softer Brexit. A better idea would be to promote a new generation of Tory MPs, many of whom happen to be enthusiastic Brexiteers. The likes of Rishi Sunak, Kwasi Kwarteng and Nusrat Ghani would bring talent to the cabinet, and diversityâ€”not least in terms of age, the biggest divide in British politics. Reshuffling her ministers will not solve all Mrs Mayâ€™s problems. The Tories will still be irreparably split on the most important issue facing Britain. But promoting some new faces with new ideas and a dash of competence would give the government a better shot at dealing with it. It would also prepare the ground for Mrs Mayâ€™s eventual handover to a new leader. The next generation of MPs offers an embarrassment of riches. Too many of the current cabinet are just an embarrassment.

economist,Oct 12th 2017,Cambodiaâ€™s prime minister has wrecked a 25-year push for democracy," It was the first time the UN had ever taken over the administration of a whole country. It was supposed to be a demonstration of the great things that the organisation could achieve in the new, post-cold-war world. Sadly, it now looks like a cautionary tale. Although Mr Hun Sen professed to accept the UNâ€™s agenda, in practice he worked to frustrate it. He threatened to reignite the civil war unless he was allowed to stay on as â€œsecond prime ministerâ€ù, even though he lost the election that the UN oversaw. He later launched a coup against the â€œfirst prime ministerâ€ù. Although he has continued to hold regular elections, every time an opposition party looks strong enough to challenge him, he finds a way to hobble it, not least by telling voters that the choice is him or war. All this is a terrible wasteâ€”most obviously of money. The UNâ€™s 20-month administration in 1992-93 cost $1.6bn (equivalent to $2.5bn today and enough to give every Cambodian 66% of the average income per person at the time). Western donors have since spent billions more to help strengthen Cambodiaâ€™s democracy. Mr Hun Sen has left them little to show for it. Can-bodia It is also a missed opportunity. Unlike Afghanistan, say, where international efforts at nation-building have foundered in part because the country is racked by insurgency, Cambodia is at peace. It also has few ethnic or sectarian rifts to polarise national politics. And Cambodia, although poor, has booming garment and tourism industries, which have helped the economy to grow rapidly in recent years. A functioning democracy does not seem like a pipe dream. Western governments have found it harder to get Mr Hun Senâ€™s attention since he struck up a close friendship with China, which is now both the biggest donor to Cambodia and its biggest source of investment. But Western aid is still important to the government, as are the Western firms that buy much of the output of Cambodiaâ€™s garment factories and the Western tourists who visit its temples. Mr Hun Sen would be vulnerable, in other words, to a vigorous international campaign to induce him to restore democracyâ€”he just does not expect one. That may be the most depressing development of all.

economist,Oct 12th 2017,How to judge whether deregulation is going too far," This newspaper laments Republicansâ€™ shameful denial of scientific facts, and despairs at the unwillingness of Congress to act to address climate change. Yet the argument that Mr Obama stretched the boundaries of his legal authority has merit. Neither the CPP nor Mr Obamaâ€™s other flagship environmental rule, which concerns the regulation of waterways, has ever come into effect, because each was stayed by the courts. Either or both could yet be struck down completely. Mr Trump, who wants to change Senate rules to force through his agenda, is an unlikely guardian of Americaâ€™s constitution. The true test of whether he is committed to limiting executive rule-making will come when Congress refuses to comply with his agenda on, say, trade policy. After all, Mr Obama came to office determined to pare back the powers of the presidency, but then changed course when Congress frustrated him. And the early signs are not good. Having failed to repeal Obamacare, Mr Trump promised this week to â€œ[use] the power of the penâ€ù to implement health reform. The second supposed advance is towards more rigorous analysis of the effects of regulations. The Obama administration tended to take too rosy a view of the benefits of government intervention. For example, it tried to boost wages by greatly expanding the number of workers eligible for overtime pay. This defies economic logic; it is a bit like raising the minimum wage, but only on Fridays. Under Mr Trump, such folly is less likely. That is partly because there is less regulation happening to begin with. It is also because the office in the White House responsible for vetting agenciesâ€™ analyses, whose career staff are more cautious than other bureaucrats, has gained influence. That is welcome. The Treasuryâ€™s proposals regarding Dodd-Frank, Mr Obamaâ€™s flagship financial reform, have been encouragingly thoughtful. It is the third part of Mr Trumpâ€™s regulatory agenda that is worrying. The administration is measuring its success by how much it can reduce regulatory costs to firms, while seeming to ignore the benefits to consumers and citizens that might be lost along the way. Republicansâ€™ use of Congressâ€™s right of review to repeal 14 rules issued late in Mr Obamaâ€™s presidency was not based on a careful consideration of costs and benefits, so much as on an insistence that the rules were too burdensome for businesses. That attitude could wreak havoc with environmental regulation, which imposes the biggest costs but also brings the biggest rewards. Even diehard libertarians should worry when the administration weakens rules governing the leaching of coal ash into groundwater, or permits the use of pesticides that may impair childrenâ€™s brain development. Rules for regulators Maximising benefits to society is too lofty a goal for regulators. Yet the goal must not simply be to please firms, either. Instead, regulators should identify and correct obvious market failures, and promote competition. With that in mind, we propose a litmus test for Mr Trumpâ€™s regulatory overhaul: his approach to antitrust policy. This is one area in which regulators have been too lax, allowing many firms to gain market power. If Mr Trump beefs up antitrust enforcement, ignoring the complaints of bosses, it will signal that his administration is implementing a considered regulatory philosophy. If, however, he weakens it, it will be a sign that his real goal is to govern in the name of business.

economist,Oct 12th 2017,The failure to rebuild Mosul could let Islamic State return," The reconquest of Mosul has been a long and brutal business. Life has swiftly resumed in the newer, eastern half of the city. But the western half, especially the old city, is a dangerous and toxic heap of rubble. Americans who see it are reminded of the Allied bombing of Dresden. Others recall the sack of Nineveh, the ancient Assyrian capital that once stood on modern Mosulâ€™s outskirts. Mr Abadi, a Shia Arab, pays lip service to reconstruction and reconciliation with Sunnis. He has promoted some Sunni generals. But he is showing little haste in making the western part of the city habitable once more (see article). Parts of Fallujah, another big Sunni town that was damaged when it was recaptured from jihadists in June 2016, are still in ruins. Granted, the Iraqi army is still fighting to clear IS from its last enclaves. Of late, it has advanced on the town of Hawija and the pockets of land the jihadists still control along the border with Syria. Americaâ€™s generals have turned their attention to the fight for Raqqa. Its diplomats are consumed by efforts to avert another civil war in Iraq, this time between Shias and the Kurds, who voted last month in favour of independence in a referendum that was opposed by Mr Abadi. The outside world is not showing much concern about Mosul. A date has yet to be fixed for an international conference in Kuwait on reconstruction. Officials say the government does not have the money to rebuild the city. But the real issue is not the meansâ€”this year Iraqâ€™s government will raise some $70bn in revenue, most of it from oil salesâ€”but the will. Mr Abadi and other politicians, preparing for a general election in April, prefer to direct any money towards their clients and constituents. Moreover, some Shias seem to think that the ruins of Mosul should stand as a reminder to Sunnis, and a warning to Kurds, of the costs of revolt. Certainly many Sunnis see a deliberate Shia plot to destroy them. Iraqâ€™s Shia rulers thus risk repeating the misrule of Saddam Hussein, the late Sunni dictator: his suppression and displacement of Iraqâ€™s Kurds fuelled their desire for independence, and his repression of Shias helped fan sectarian hatred. The marginalisation of Sunnis by Shia governments pushed them into the arms of ISâ€”a process encouraged by the jihadists themselves. Mr Abadi must find effective governors for Sunni areas, provide them with funds for reconstruction and give them more autonomy in running their affairs, not least in policing. As the war winds down, he should start demobilising Shia militias and absorbing some into Iraqi units. Gulf states, having started to talk to Mr Abadi, should provide aid and help Iraq integrate into the region, thereby encouraging non-sectarian policies. A concerted effort to rebuild Mosul, an ancient multi-ethnic city, should be a common project to help bind Iraqâ€™s wounds. It would signal to Kurds that they have more to gain by staying within Iraq than in breaking awayâ€”particularly if they got a share of the contracts. Ultimately IS feeds on Arab Sunnisâ€™ sense of dispossession, not just in Iraq but also in Syria, where mostly Sunni cities have been devastated in the civil war. Success in Mosul, and a political settlement that gives Sunnis their proper place, is vital to winning the peace in Iraq, and may set an example to help end the war in Syria.

economist,Oct 28th 2017,Kenyaâ€™s fresh election is preposterously flawed," When Mr Odinga withdrew, it seemed like a last roll of the dice. Although the IEBC made plenty of errors in the tallying and transmission of votes, there is little proof that the election in August was rigged, as Mr Odinga claims. Short of the cash needed to continue campaigning, Mr Odingaâ€™s boycott seems to have been a desperate attempt to avoid an election he would probably have lost anyway. Yet since he left the race, his stated reasons for doing so have been vindicated. On October 18th Roselyn Akombe, one of the IEBCâ€™s commissioners, fled to America claiming to have been threatened for advocating reforms. Later that day Wafula Chebukati, the chairman of the commission, said that he could not guarantee credible elections in an atmosphere of intimidation. Compounding the sense of an organisation under siege, its chief executive officer, Ezra Chiloba, left suddenly to take a three-week holiday. On October 25th this supposed exercise in democracy became more farcical still when only two of seven Supreme Court judges arrived at work to hear a last-ditch plea to postpone the election yet again. With the court deprived of a quorum, it could not rule. One judge, Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu, stayed away after her bodyguard was shot and injured on a Nairobi street the night before the hearing. The other judges offered a variety of excuses. One was abroad; another said she had missed her flight to Nairobi. Many Kenyans, even those who do not support Mr Odinga, worry that Mr Kenyatta is determined to push ahead with an election, no matter how preposterously flawed. Kenyaâ€™s economy has slowed sharply this year as businesses have held back investment until after the election: a contested poll in 2007 led to violence that cost more than 1,000 lives and plunged the economy into crisis. Some argue that with Kenyaâ€™s budget deficit forecast to reach 12% of GDP , funded almost entirely by inflows of foreign investment, the country can ill afford another few months of uncertainty. And Mr Kenyattaâ€™s supporters feel, not unreasonably, that Mr Odinga is holding the country hostage in an attempt to win concessions or a power-sharing agreement. Yet the election, even if it proceeds without violence, will not produce the legitimacy that Mr Kenyatta needs. If the Supreme Court were to apply the same standard that it did to the poll in August, it could hardly endorse this one. And even if the judges are cowed, Mr Kenyatta will have to contend with continuing protests. In Nairobi on October 25th Mr Odinga called for â€œnational resistanceâ€ù, including boycotts, strikes and other economic disruption. Some of his closest allies even talk about secession. â€œIf a government subverts the sovereignty of the peopleâ€_ people are entitled to rebelâ€ù, says Peter Anyangâ€™ Nyongâ€™o, the governor of Kisumu county. In Nairobiâ€™s slums, where people of dozens of different tribes live side by side in crude tenements and tin shacks, anger could overflow into ethnic violence. In Mathare, a particularly mixed slum near the city centre, Kikuyu residents say that they have sent their children to the countryside until they feel safe again. The Luo residents of Kisumu do not feel safe either. â€œHe is killing our childrenâ€ù, shouts Yvonne Onyango, a housewife, of Mr Kenyatta. â€œBut he does not have enough bullets to kill all us Luos. We will keep fighting.â€ù This article appeared in the Middle East and Africa section of the print edition under the headline ""Strong man redux""",https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21730657-it-will-do-little-improve-presidents-legitimacy-kenyas-fresh-election
economist,Oct 26th 2017,The Balfour Declaration still offers lessons to Israel and the Palestinians," By then, however, the Jewish community had organised itself, forming militias, a parliament and a nascent government. When the UN voted in 1947 to partition Palestine, the Jews already had the trappings of their state. â€œWhat matters is not what the goyim [gentiles] say, but what the Jews do,â€ù said David Ben-Gurion, the first prime minister. That history is still relevant. An ascendant Israeli right wants more settlements in the lands that Israel occupied in 1967, more restrictions on left-wing NGOs, more efforts to limit â€œliberalâ€ù institutions like the courts and the media. It claims not to care about the worldâ€™s opinionâ€”and to be fair, much of the world does not have one. Israelâ€™s emerging allies in Africa and Latin America see a vibrant high-tech sector and useful military co-operation. In July Mr Netanyahu welcomed Narendra Modi to Jerusalem, the first-ever visit by an Indian prime minister. Though only Egypt and Jordan have recognised Israel, other Arab states, particularly in the Gulf, now have quiet alliances with their one-time foe. Despite Ben-Gurionâ€™s maxim, the celebrations in London and Jerusalem will be a reminder that Israel still craves moral affirmation. The then Lord Balfour saw Israel in emotional terms, a state owed to the Jews because of â€œage-old traditions and present needs.â€ù That sentiment still looms large. Palestinians, for their part, call his letter the first of many betrayals by the world. Last year Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, threatened to sue Britain unless it recognised Palestine and apologised for the declaration. He has spent much of this decade trying to win international recognition; in a sense, he has become an unlikely heir to Mr Weizmannâ€™s brand of Zionism. Palestine won observer status at the UN in 2012, and most countries in the world now recognise it as a state. Yet it is no closer to independence than it was in 1967. Mr Abbasâ€™s corrupt, sclerotic government has spent much of the past decade feuding not with Israel but with its own people. Perhaps the Balfour Declaration has a lesson for the Palestinians as well: Britain did not create Israelâ€”and nor will another foreign power create Palestine. If there is to be an end to a century of conflict, it will have to come from within.

economist,Oct 26th 2017,Saudi Arabia launches a futuristic economic zone," Sceptics can point to plans elsewhere for â€œsmart citiesâ€ù (such as Masdar in the United Arab Emirates) that are launched with much fanfare but fail to live up to the hype. In Saudi Arabia itself, the King Abdullah Financial District in Riyadh is a $10bn white camel. Will NEOM be different? It starts, at least, with the credibility that comes from its big-name supporters. At the launch were an ebullient Masayoshi Son, the Japanese head of a $100bn â€œVision Fundâ€ù, and Stephen Schwarzman, head of Blackstone, a private-equity giant. Klaus Kleinfeld, a former boss of Arconic, Alcoa and Siemens, is to be NEOMâ€™s chief executive. The prospect of creating a dynamic zone without the barriers to enterprise found elsewhere in the country has such people genuinely enthused. Still, three big questions stand in the way of the NEOM dream becoming a reality. The first is timing. Can the project come together fast enough to maintain momentum? So far, the details remain sketchy, and the timing vague. The government says the $500bn will arrive â€œover the coming yearsâ€ù. Yet a fall in oil prices since 2014 has already squeezed public finances: this year Saudi Arabiaâ€™s government will probably run a fiscal deficit of 9% of GDP and the economy has ground to a halt. Second, can NEOM generate bottom-up creativity to match the top-down vision and planning? A little â€œchaosâ€ù is needed, said the man dressed in Silicon Valley casual next to Mr Kleinfeld at the launch: Marc Raibert, the boss of Boston Dynamics, a robotics company. Whether Saudis are prepared to sit back and let such creative chaos happen will also help to answer the third, and perhaps most important, question: will NEOM attract the sort of international talent (including women) it will need to achieve its ambitions? To do so, it will have to be a much more relaxed, open place than the kingdom is today. True, it is starting to change, as MBSâ€™s comments this week made clear. Thanks to his influence, women will at last be allowed to drive next year. Maybe NEOM can accelerate such progress. But there is a long way to go. Unless it becomes a truly desirable place in which to live and work, NEOM will risk realising one of its goals, but not in the way intended. It hopes to be the first city where robots outnumber people.

economist,Oct 26th 2017,Israelâ€™s â€œNew Labourâ€ù party," The Labour party last won an election in 1999 and has since changed leaders eight times. Party members who voted for a very different kind of leader this time are willing to give him a chance. â€œPeople on the left still think what happened is just an aberration and the reins of power will soon be handed back to us,â€ù says Emilie Moatti, a Labour member who is planning to run for a seat in the Knesset at the next election. She laments that Mr Netanyahu has successfully â€œtainted us all as unpatriotic haters of Israel.â€ù Labour, which ruled Israel for its first three decades after the stateâ€™s establishment in 1948, is not the only opposition party undergoing an identity crisis. Meretz, a fiercely secularist party that describes itself as â€œIsraelâ€™s Left,â€ù has suffered a series of electoral defeats that almost wiped the party out. On October 18th the partyâ€™s leader, Zehava Galon, said she was resigning from the Knesset in the hope of sparking â€œopen primariesâ€ù for its next leaders. â€œThere is a deep frustration on the left over having drifted away from positions of influence for so long,â€ù says Nitzan Horowitz, a former member of the Knesset for Meretz. â€œMoving to the right or changing selection procedures wonâ€™t change that.â€ù The anomaly of Israeli politics is that a majority of voters supports the leftâ€™s two-state solution but continues to vote for right-wing leaders. Perhaps that will change if Labour is led by a right-winger.

In August Muhammadu Buhari, Nigeriaâ€™s president and a stern former military dictator, said that â€œNigeriaâ€™s unity is settled and not negotiable.â€ù In September the government sent in the army on â€œOperation Python Dance IIâ€ù, which sought to tackle â€œviolent agitations by secessionist groups, among other crimesâ€ù. One of its first acts was to attack an office in Abia belonging to the Nigerian Union of Journalists and to smash reportersâ€™ equipment. The government also declared IPOB a terrorist organisation. The group says it is not violent. The governmentâ€™s response may, however, be feeding the resentment that first led to an upsurge of support for IPOB among Nigeriaâ€™s Igbo. â€œIt was as if the approach of the government labelled every Igbo man a member of IPOB,â€ù says Sam Hart, an adviser to Abiaâ€™s governor (who is from the main opposition party). The perception of the army as a northern institution, and the fact Mr Buhari is from the north (there has not been an Igbo head of state since the military government of Major-General Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi in 1966), has compounded many Igbosâ€™ feelings of alienation. Many also refer to comments made by Mr Buhari in 2015, when he said that constituencies that gave him 5% of the vote (mainly those in the south-east) cannot expect the same treatment as those that gave him 97%. The army may have cut off the head of the Biafran separatist snake for now. But until Nigeria cleans up its public finances so that its various ethnic groups can see how much money it raises, and where it is spent, resentments will simmer and the appeal of Biafra will remain.

A few Kurds took up arms in Kirkuk, vainly shooting their rifles. But most Peshmerga fled for the hills, together with some 60,000 civilians, past the unseeing eyes of a 21-metre-high statue of a Kurdish fighter that was recently erected on Kirkukâ€™s northern edge. With them went the prospects of statehood. The Kurdish region was already broke. Without Kirkukâ€™s 300,000 barrels of oil per day (providing roughly half of the Kurdish governmentâ€™s revenues), it cannot hope to be viable. Militarily, the Kurds look a shambles. And politically their institutions are hollow. When his term in office expired in 2015, Mr Barzani suspended parliament and ruled like an autocrat. In the wake of the rout, Mr Barzaniâ€™s men put elections on hold, indefinitely. With no democratic means of replacing Mr Barzani, the Kurdish enclave is at risk of dissolving once more into competing fiefs, as it did during a civil war in the 1990s. Rival clan leaders accuse each other of betrayal. The Barzanis â€œfought for oil; we fought for soil,â€ù says Lahur Talabani, the head of one of the enclaveâ€™s two intelligence agencies and a contender to succeed his uncle as leader of the eastern fief. The Talabanis committed â€œa great and historic treason against Kurdistanâ€ù, retorts Nechirvan Barzani, Masoud Barzaniâ€™s nephew and the Kurdish prime minister. A plague on both your houses, say many Kurds. Whereas the Kurdish government is in tatters, Iraqâ€™s Shia-led one has revived. In quick succession it has crushed one group of separatists (the barbaric IS) and hobbled another (the Kurds). Its army is battle-hardened. The northern oilfields it now controls will allow it to boost production and raise more cash. Thanks to the military victories, Haider al-Abadi, the Iraqi prime minister, looks well-placed to win a second term in 2018. His American backers hope that he will build a pluralist, non-sectarian Iraq. Certainly, Iraqâ€™s Shia leaders have refrained from triumphalist bombast. They talk of inclusion, not liberation, and say they will halt their advance at the borders of the original Kurdish region. They are proposing a joint administration in the territories from which the Kurds have been ousted. In Kirkuk, they will leave the local police, led by a Kurd, in charge. There have been few reports of revenge killings or looting. Turkomans in Kirkuk even rallied to protect Kurdish homes. Most Kurds who fled have returned home, says the UN. Yet the ethnic goodwill could fray again. To Kurdish chagrin, some Arabs and Turkomans cheered the arrival of Iraqi tanks as they filed past Kirkukâ€™s ancient citadel. Footage of government troops pinning Shia flags to government buildings in Khanaqin makes them shiver. And though broken for now, the Kurds might yet rally, should Baghdadâ€™s authorities seek to impose direct rule on the reduced Kurdish enclave. Kurds have governed themselves since 1991. Two generations have grown up without bowing to Baghdad or even bothering to learn Arabic. Mr Abadiâ€™s armed Shia rivals also hope to profit from victory. The Shia Popular Mobilisation, or hashd, feels emboldened. Two of its leaders stood alongside army generals as they raised Iraqâ€™s flag over Kirkuk. Some urge Mr Abadi to demobilise them before he loses control, but Mr Abadi shies away from confrontation. â€œAfter the election,â€ù suggests a minister. Iran also looks stronger. Qassem Suleimani, the head of the Quds Force, the foreign operations arm of Iranâ€™s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, shuttled between Sulaymaniyah and Baghdad mediating Kurdish capitulation and advising Iraqi commanders on their assault. Remarkably, given that it arms and trains both Iraqâ€™s army and Kurdish forces, America kept silent. For all his grandiose promises to roll back Iran, Donald Trump looked like a bystander. In Kirkuk, Iran called the shots.

economist,Oct 21st 2017,"Syriaâ€™s Kurds led the advance on Raqqa, but now may fracture"," It is also intent on moulding young minds. Schools in Raqqa, most of whose inhabitants are Arab, are still using official Syrian textbooksâ€”though with photos of the ruling Assad family ripped out. However, some local Kurdish officials have suggested a new curriculum much like the one the PYD has introduced in other areas under its control. The new one is very political, promotes the PYDâ€™s left-wing view of the world, and is not accredited by any official standards authority. Arab teachers in Hasaka, in the north-east of Syria, protested in August against the switch. But apart from sporadic protests, there has been no serious internal opposition to the PYD. The Asayish are ruthlessly effective, and the population is exhausted by war. In the long run, though, the PYDâ€™s oppressive rule will fuel the same Sunni Arab alienation that gave rise to the Islamic State. â€œThe Kurds didnâ€™t read their history well,â€ù says an activist. â€œTheir acts will just allow other extremists to come back.â€ù It may also splinter the SDF. Thousands of Arab rebels have already defected to other groups. Because of its American backing, the SDF has enjoyed a degree of immunity from pro-regime forces and Russian warplanes. But with Raqqa liberated, America will probably pull back its special forces. Even without further desertions, the SDFâ€™s 50,000 troops are stretched too thin to defend all of its territory, some of which is also important for the regime since the east holds much of Syriaâ€™s oil reserves. Rather than fight the regime, some SDF commanders are open to negotiating with it. The SDF has accepted pro-regime militias into its ranks and has been arresting vocal anti-Assad activists. It will be harder to cut a deal with Turkey. The PYD is affiliated with the Kurdistan Workersâ€™ Party, which has fought a decades-long insurgency against the Turkish government. Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkeyâ€™s president, calls the PYD a terrorist organisation, and his warplanes have already bombed camps belonging to the PYDâ€™s armed wing in both Syria and Iraq. In October he deployed troops to Idlib province, ostensibly to fight jihadist groups. The real target may be the Kurds. Just as Iraqâ€™s Kurds may fail to realise their dreams of an independent state (see previous article), so their Syrian brethren could find that their own autonomy is even shorter-lived.

economist,Oct 19th 2017,The boycott of Qatar is hurting its enforcers," South of Dubaiâ€™s glittering skyscrapers lies Jebel Ali, the busiest port in the region.Â It handles more than a third of cargoes in the Gulf and, beforeÂ theÂ boycott, 85% of shipborne cargo for Qatar.Â Neighbours have long wanted to grab its market share. In September QatarÂ opened a new $7.4bn port,Â years in the making, that allows shippersÂ to bypassÂ the UAEÂ altogether.Â Saudi Arabia is building aÂ portÂ on its west coast, near Jeddah,Â just south of the Suez canal.Â The blockade will accelerate this shift from Dubai.Â Qatar Navigation, a shipping conglomerate, is moving its regional hub from the UAE to Oman, which has not joined the boycott.Â Its trade with QatarÂ grew by 2,000% this summer. Traffic at its port, Salalah, is up 29%. The blockade is also weakening the six-country Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC), of which Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE are members. Although it was never much of a political union, it had at least allowed goods and people to move freely across borders. But the boycott has upendedÂ that. It is also, ironically, rewarding the GCCâ€™s biggest rival. Trade between Qatar and Iran was $98m last year. Iranian exports to Qatar grew by about 60% this summer.Â With Saudi airspace closed, scores of Qatar Airways flights now arc over Iran each day.

economist,May 11th 2013,"To the brainy, the spoils"," Companies are reluctant to talk about their use of consultants, and consultancies are relentlessly tight-lipped. Bain is said to use code-names for clients even in internal discussions. Such secrecy makes this a hard industry to analyse. It also lets stereotypes flourish. McKinseyites are said to be â€œvainiesâ€ù (who come and lecture clients on the McKinsey way). BCG people are â€œbrainiesâ€ù (who spout academic theory). And the â€œBainiesâ€ù have a reputation for throwing bodies at delivering quick bottom-line results for clients. In fact, the big three all learn from each other. All three now use their alumni networks to gather intelligence and generate businessâ€”something McKinsey is famous for. All three stake some of their fees on the success of their projects, a practice once associated with Bain. And all three show off their big ideas to the wider public, as BCGâ€™s founder was once among the few to do. Consulting is no licence to make easy money. Cynics sneer that clients spend millions on consultants only to give the boss an excuse to do what he planned to do anyway. But that would be implausibly wasteful in these days of tight budgets. Consultants today cannot just deliver a slideshow and pocket fat fees. Even the elite three now make most of their revenue from implementing ideas, from finding ways to improve clientsâ€™ internal processes and from other tasks not traditionally considered â€œstrategy consultingâ€ù. As the elite firms move down into implementation and operations, they are meeting big new rivals hoping to move up into the loftier realms of strategy. Over the weekend of May 4th-5th partners at Roland Berger, a mid-tier consultancy, met to discuss a possible buyer for their firm. The most likely candidates are thought to be PwC, Deloitte and Ernst &amp; Young, three of the â€œBig Fourâ€ù accounting firms (the other is KPMG). The big accountancy firms now do more consulting than McKinsey, BCG and Bain. Much of this involves manpower-intensive tasks such as technology integration. But their strategy and operations practices are ambitious, too. In January Deloitte bought Monitor, a brainy strategy firm, out of bankruptcy. In 2011 PwC bought PTRM, a respected operations consultancy. All four have scooped up smaller firms too. A successful Big Four bid for Roland Berger would reopen an old question: can the Big Four crack the elite tier? It is too early to know whether the brainboxes of Monitor will fit comfortably into the Deloitte juggernaut. When EDS, a computer-equipment and services provider, bought A.T. Kearney, a midsized strategy firm, cultures clashed calamitously. A.T. Kearney bought itself free in 2006. Nonetheless, Mike Canning, the head of Deloitteâ€™s strategy consulting in America, says the Monitor integration is going smoothly, and that clients are showing new interest in Deloitte. Is Deloitte competing with McKinsey, Bain and BCG for work? â€œDay in, day out, on a regular basis,â€ù says Mr Canning. Dana McIlwain of PwC echoes that: â€œWe are definitely competing today, and only more so in the future.â€ù Bob Bechek, Bainâ€™s boss, puts it differently: competition with the Big Four is up â€œvery slightly in the past few years, but I mean like a couple of percentage pointsâ€ù. He salutes the Big Four: they do what they do well and profitably. But he argues that the heavy-lift, repeatable work at which they excel is a different kind of business. Strategy consultants concoct novel solutions to unique problems, which is hard. Rich Lesser, BCGâ€™s boss, acknowledges the challenge from the Big Four, but is confident. Having new rivals is nothing new, he says. Tom Rodenhauser of Kennedy Information reckons that the Big Four â€œare cracking the C-suite, but theyâ€™re not first on the speed-dial for strategy workâ€ù. The elite firms are keen not to seem complacent. While boasting about opening offices in BogotÃ¡ or Addis Ababa they acknowledge that emerging-world bosses are not blown away by flashy names. The consultants aim to win trust with quick projects that show bottom-line results, before looking to book longer engagements. Clients in the rich world are changing, too. Fifteen years ago Indra Nooyi, then the head of strategy (now the boss) at PepsiCo, was a demanding client for consultants, having been one herself at BCG. She was a rarity at the time. No longer: the consultancies have seen many of their alumni go on to fill senior positions at big companies. Some, such as McKinsey, make it easy for big firms to poach their people, by putting potential employers directly in touch with consultants who tick the right boxes for a vacancy. The idea is that this outplacement service makes McKinsey a more attractive place to work. It also keeps the talent churning, constantly refreshing the firmâ€™s intellectual capital.

economist,Oct 12th 2017,Why McKinsey is under attack in South Africa," As an international firm requiring a local partner, McKinsey had previously worked with a related company called Regiments. The consulting firm says that after Trillian emerged from Regiments in late 2015, it carried out a due diligence review and cut its ties with Trillian a few months later. McKinsey says it never entered into a formal contract with Trillian or made payments to the company, and there are letters to show that McKinsey warned Eskom about the risks of doing business with Trillian. But that has not put a stop to questions about the relationship. A former executive of Trillian, Bianca Goodson, has alleged that Trillian acted as a gatekeeper, using Mr Essaâ€™s connections to land contracts and then passing the work over to â€œinternationally recognised companiesâ€ù including McKinsey. The firm stands behind its work for Eskom, says Steve John, global director of communications at McKinsey. Neither the Gupta family nor any company publicly linked to the Guptas has ever been a client of the firm, he notes. It has hired a law firm, Norton Rose Fulbright, to carry out a detailed internal investigation. It is an embarrassing situation for a group that prides itself on operating as â€œOne Firmâ€ù across its local offices, says Tom Rodenhauser of ALM Intelligence, a market-research firm that monitors the consulting industry. McKinsey has weathered damage to its reputation before; in 2010 one of its consultants pleaded guilty to passing inside information to a New York-based hedge fund, Galleon Group. McKinseyâ€™s close links with Enron also meant that its reputation was tarnished by the energy companyâ€™s collapse in 2001. Politiciansâ€™ scrutiny may drag on. The DA party says it will push for the firmâ€™s executives to appear before a parliamentary inquiry into Eskom this month. The party has also gone to the police to file a complaint of fraud and racketeering against McKinsey, and written to Americaâ€™s Securities and Exchange Commission and Britainâ€™s Serious Fraud Office (the firm had no comment about the DAâ€™s complaints). Public anger has also focused on the fees charged by McKinsey to Eskom, a public entity. According to a report by Eskom and G9 Forensic, an anti-corruption consulting firm, McKinsey and Trillian earned 1.6bn rand ($117m) for work done in 2015 and 2016, and expected to make another 7.8bn rand. A second review commissioned by Eskom from Oliver Wyman, another consulting firm, into its contracts with McKinsey, found a â€œvery unusualâ€ù fee structure that resulted in costs above industry norms. On October 5th Eskom demanded that McKinsey pay back 1bn rand. (McKinsey said it would support a high court review of the contract and repay its fees if the deal were found to be illegal). Standard Bank, Africaâ€™s biggest lender by assets, is reviewing its relationship with McKinsey. The publicity is likely to test the loyalty of many other African clients.

economist,Sep 21st 2013,The future of the Firm," McKinseyâ€™s success depends above all on an unimpeachable reputation for integrity. It cannot continue to serve most of the worldâ€™s leading companies (including working simultaneously for competitors) if its consultants are willing to spill secrets. Mr McDonald argues that the firmâ€™s size makes it impossible to avoid repeats of the Kumar problem. It is now a giant factory with 1,200 consultants rather than the cosy club of old. The firm has to keep growing, not least to provide its partners with the $1.5m or so a year that they earn. But every time it grows it puts its most important asset at risk. McKinseyâ€™s success also depends on its ability to remain at the cutting edge of business. But in recent years it has seemed to be on the wrong cutting edge. Mr McDonald points out that whereas McKinsey has led the â€œfinancialisationâ€ù of basic industries such as oil and gas, it has had little if any role in shaping the giants of the internet economy, such as Apple and Google. The new lords of business are engineers in hoodies, not MBAs in pinstripes. Mr Christensen focuses on a bigger subject: how the forces that have disrupted so many other businesses, from steel to publishing, are disrupting consulting. The big three strategy consultantsâ€”the other two are the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) and Bainâ€”are masters of opacity. But Mr Christensen argues that light is being let in on the magic. Companies are getting better at measuring results and demanding value for money. They also have access to more business expertise than ever before: the big three have more than 50,000 living alumni. The big three have been masters at bundling lots of different services into a single, high-priced package. But clients no longer want to pay fat fees for a bit of strategic advice from a senior partner and a lot of humdrum work from neophytes. Mr Christensen says low-priced competitors are beginning to dismember the consultantsâ€™ business. Eden McCallum cuts costs by deploying freelancers, most of whom once worked for the big three. BeyondCore replaces overpriced junior analysts with Big Data, crunching vast amounts of information to identify trends. McKinsey clearly faces a more difficult market than it is used to. But it has overcome serious challenges beforeâ€”such as in the 1980s, when it lost the intellectual high ground to BCG and then Bain before regaining it. The firm is fixing some of the problems from the Gupta era. It has elected two successive managing directors, Ian Davis and Dominic Barton, who have worked hard to restore its professional ethos. Mr Barton urges companies to embrace â€œlong-term capitalismâ€ù rather than â€œquarterly capitalismâ€ù and corporate responsibility rather than financial engineering: the very opposite of the Enron-era McKinseyâ€™s gospel. Old boys (and girls) everywhere McKinsey also has two huge assets: talent and knowledge. It retains an unrivalled ability to recruit hundreds of clever young people and turn them into an army of problem-solving worker ants. It also has an enviable network of alumni, many of whom are happy to hire their old employer: in 2011 more than 150 ex-McKinseyites were running companies with more than $1 billion in annual sales. The firm has also invested heavily in knowledge for decades: perhaps no other organisation has as much interesting data on global capitalism. Though lesser firms may be facing disruption, McKinsey dispenses a special sort of consultorial fairy-dust that is hard to replicate, and as much in demand as ever. The global ruling class is seized with a toxic combination of status-obsession and status-insecurity. Decision-makers also fear being swept away by one of Mr Christensenâ€™s disruptive forces. They seek constant reassurance and reaffirmation from prestigious institutions. McKinsey knows better than almost anyone how to exploit this peculiar mindset. That will guarantee the Firm a solid future, even if no one can prove that its advice actually does any good.

economist,May 17th 2014,From advising to doing," For similar reasons, management consultants have also expanded beyond their roots in strategy. When the financial crisis took hold in 2008, dragging hundreds of companies into distress, the strategy firms found themselves poorly placed to help. â€œIf a client was going into bankruptcy, we couldnâ€™t walk through that valley of darkness with them,â€ù says McKinseyâ€™s Jon Garcia. So in 2010 the company set up a Recovery and Transformation Services (RTS) practice, which Mr Garcia heads. Stepping into the limelight For McKinsey, the turnaround business is unfamiliar turf. For 80 years the firm merely sold advice, which clients were free to ignoreâ€”shielding the consultants from blame whenever things went awry. In contrast, RTS offers direct interim management: for example, in 2011 a McKinsey partner became temporary chief financial officer at CHC Helicopter, a Canadian aviation company. Moreover, whereas McKinsey has always sought to keep a low profile, RTS operates in the public eye, since payments by insolvent companies require a judgeâ€™s approval. So far, RTS has already scored one big bankrupt client in American Airlines, and worked on the restructurings of AMF, which owns bowling alleys, and Harry &amp; David, a seller of gift baskets. The incumbents say their competitive position is safe. â€œThis is not the kind of work you can do with newly minted MBAs,â€ù says Jay Marshall of AlixPartners. â€œThe stakes are much higher in restructuring, and having someone whoâ€™s been through that before is critical.â€ù Mr Garcia agrees. But that, of course, is why he has been hiring their staff: McKinseyâ€™s RTS division had already lured six experts from AlixPartners before Mr Thompson and Mr Naumann. Especially if AlixPartners loses its lawsuit, it risks losing more of its staff to its big, new rival.",https://www.economist.com/news/business/21602240-mckinsey-tries-its-hand-restructuring-business-advising-doing
economist,Aug 31st 2012,A bail-out for Romney?," According to the article, the FDIC-run bank was due $30.6m from Bain &amp; Co. If the consulting firm went into bankruptcy, the bank could expect as little as $3m, since consulting firms have few tangible assets (office equipment and the like) to sell in a bankruptcy. Because Bain &amp; Company's odd agreements with the bank would allow the firm to pay out bonuses before creditors could grab its assets, the Bain people (led by Mr Romney) were holding all the cards. Indeed, Mr Romney made good on his threat: senior executives at Bain &amp; Company did start getting big bonuses as the negotiations were ongoing in the early 1990s. In the end, says Mr Dickinson, ""The FDIC agreed to accept nearly $5 million in cash to retire $15 million in Bain's debtâ€”an immediate government bailout of $10 million."" <img alt="""" class=""component-image__img blog-post-article-image"" data-reactid=""485"" sizes=""(min-width: 600px) 640px, calc(100vw - 20px)"" src=""https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2012/08/blogs/democracy-america/bain2_foia.jpg"" srcset=""//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/200-width/images/2012/08/blogs/democracy-america/bain2_foia.jpg 200w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/300-width/images/2012/08/blogs/democracy-america/bain2_foia.jpg 300w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/400-width/images/2012/08/blogs/democracy-america/bain2_foia.jpg 400w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/640-width/images/2012/08/blogs/democracy-america/bain2_foia.jpg 640w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/800-width/images/2012/08/blogs/democracy-america/bain2_foia.jpg 800w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/1000-width/images/2012/08/blogs/democracy-america/bain2_foia.jpg 1000w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/1200-width/images/2012/08/blogs/democracy-america/bain2_foia.jpg 1200w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/1280-width/images/2012/08/blogs/democracy-america/bain2_foia.jpg 1280w,//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/1600-width/images/2012/08/blogs/democracy-america/bain2_foia.jpg 1600w""/> At the heart of this story is a strange fact: that banks lent Bain &amp; Company money with a provision that would allow Bain's top people to raid the cash-kitty before any liquidation forced by bankruptcy. But the FDIC document (see image) seems to confirm that this is the case. If the story is not fatally undercut by subsequent reporting or the Romney campaign's explanations, it should harm the Romney campaign. The fact that the taxpayer was not directly on the hook (the FDIC is funded by member banks) softens the story's stingâ€”and probably makes the word ""bailout"" a stretch. Â But the FDIC's job is shoring up banks, not consulting firms. Mr Romney thought that Detroit carmakers should be allowed to go bust rather than getting federal help. Paul Ryan said this week ""We will not spend four years blaming others; we will take responsibility."" The tea-party movement began in 2009 when Rick Santelli, a financial reporter, decried ""losers"" getting money from hard-working Americans because those losers had overextended themselves on their home purchases. If Bain &amp; Company was just such a ""loser"" with too big an appetite, and got a handout to keep its loans above water, Mr Romney has some awkward explaining to do. And ""it was perfectly legal"" will not do the trick. ""Legal but stomach-turning"" is all too common in American finance these days. Mitt Romney can ill afford to be more closely associated with dealings like that. Update: Â The Romney campaign has responded to say that Mitt Romney rescued Bain and Co without a single taxpayer dollar, by bringing everyone - the founders and the creditors - together to take tough steps to save the firm. A campaign source notes that Mr Romney had nothing to do with writing the original loan covenants that allowed paying staff before creditors. Mr Romney was at Bain Capital when the agreements were made, before he returned to Bain &amp; Company. It's also worth noting that Bain &amp; Company remains a prestigious and successful consulting firm to this day. In other words, running into a cash crunch didn't necessarily make Bain a ""loser"". This leaves the political question of how to distinguish (beforehand, with imperfect knowledge) a loser from a troubled entity worth saving. Had Bain &amp; Company gone into bankruptcy, it's unclear whether it would have re-emerged. Mr Romney's hard bargaining kept Bain from having to face that question. And perhaps only time will tell whether the Making Home Affordable programme or the GM bail-out were more like the Bain example (keeping worthy but troubled borrowers alive), or were cases of temporarily resuscitating terminal cases that should better have been left to the bankruptcy system.

economist,May 11th 2013,"To the brainy, the spoils"," Companies are reluctant to talk about their use of consultants, and consultancies are relentlessly tight-lipped. Bain is said to use code-names for clients even in internal discussions. Such secrecy makes this a hard industry to analyse. It also lets stereotypes flourish. McKinseyites are said to be â€œvainiesâ€ù (who come and lecture clients on the McKinsey way). BCG people are â€œbrainiesâ€ù (who spout academic theory). And the â€œBainiesâ€ù have a reputation for throwing bodies at delivering quick bottom-line results for clients. In fact, the big three all learn from each other. All three now use their alumni networks to gather intelligence and generate businessâ€”something McKinsey is famous for. All three stake some of their fees on the success of their projects, a practice once associated with Bain. And all three show off their big ideas to the wider public, as BCGâ€™s founder was once among the few to do. Consulting is no licence to make easy money. Cynics sneer that clients spend millions on consultants only to give the boss an excuse to do what he planned to do anyway. But that would be implausibly wasteful in these days of tight budgets. Consultants today cannot just deliver a slideshow and pocket fat fees. Even the elite three now make most of their revenue from implementing ideas, from finding ways to improve clientsâ€™ internal processes and from other tasks not traditionally considered â€œstrategy consultingâ€ù. As the elite firms move down into implementation and operations, they are meeting big new rivals hoping to move up into the loftier realms of strategy. Over the weekend of May 4th-5th partners at Roland Berger, a mid-tier consultancy, met to discuss a possible buyer for their firm. The most likely candidates are thought to be PwC, Deloitte and Ernst &amp; Young, three of the â€œBig Fourâ€ù accounting firms (the other is KPMG). The big accountancy firms now do more consulting than McKinsey, BCG and Bain. Much of this involves manpower-intensive tasks such as technology integration. But their strategy and operations practices are ambitious, too. In January Deloitte bought Monitor, a brainy strategy firm, out of bankruptcy. In 2011 PwC bought PTRM, a respected operations consultancy. All four have scooped up smaller firms too. A successful Big Four bid for Roland Berger would reopen an old question: can the Big Four crack the elite tier? It is too early to know whether the brainboxes of Monitor will fit comfortably into the Deloitte juggernaut. When EDS, a computer-equipment and services provider, bought A.T. Kearney, a midsized strategy firm, cultures clashed calamitously. A.T. Kearney bought itself free in 2006. Nonetheless, Mike Canning, the head of Deloitteâ€™s strategy consulting in America, says the Monitor integration is going smoothly, and that clients are showing new interest in Deloitte. Is Deloitte competing with McKinsey, Bain and BCG for work? â€œDay in, day out, on a regular basis,â€ù says Mr Canning. Dana McIlwain of PwC echoes that: â€œWe are definitely competing today, and only more so in the future.â€ù Bob Bechek, Bainâ€™s boss, puts it differently: competition with the Big Four is up â€œvery slightly in the past few years, but I mean like a couple of percentage pointsâ€ù. He salutes the Big Four: they do what they do well and profitably. But he argues that the heavy-lift, repeatable work at which they excel is a different kind of business. Strategy consultants concoct novel solutions to unique problems, which is hard. Rich Lesser, BCGâ€™s boss, acknowledges the challenge from the Big Four, but is confident. Having new rivals is nothing new, he says. Tom Rodenhauser of Kennedy Information reckons that the Big Four â€œare cracking the C-suite, but theyâ€™re not first on the speed-dial for strategy workâ€ù. The elite firms are keen not to seem complacent. While boasting about opening offices in BogotÃ¡ or Addis Ababa they acknowledge that emerging-world bosses are not blown away by flashy names.

But once the economy recovered, the climate for the Big Four started to resemble the 1990s. They began to rush back into consultancy, encouraged by its high margins and double-digit annual growth rates at a time when revenue growth from auditing and tax work had slowed. In particular, Deloitte and PwC began gobbling up operations consultancies as they sparred for the top spot. For years the strategy firms remained beyond the Big Fourâ€™s grasp. During the 2000s they had mostly prospered on their own, and their partners shuddered at the thought of being subsumed into giant bureaucracies. After the financial crisis, however, midsized strategy consultants hit hard times. Cost-conscious companies with globalising businesses wanted either to hire boutiques with deep knowledge of their industries, or to benefit from the scale of generalist firms with offices everywhere. Too big for some clients and too small for others, Monitor went under, and Boozâ€”a spin-off from Booz Allen Hamilton, which now focuses on operations work for governmentsâ€”went on the block. Both Booz and PwC say that the two sides of consulting are converging, and that more clients want a one-stop shop that can both devise a strategy and execute it. Deloitte and Monitor claim their integration is already bearing fruit. â€œThereâ€™s been a very healthy two-way cross-selling opportunity,â€ù says Mike Canning of Deloitte. Nonetheless, Boozâ€™s leadership still faces a hard sell to get the deal passed. In 2010 the companyâ€™s partners voted down a proposed merger with AT Kearney, another midsized strategy firm. This marriage involves far more risks. A significant number of Boozâ€™s clients would immediately be in doubt because PwC audits themâ€”strategy consulting for audit clients is banned in many countries, and even where it is legal it is frowned upon (not least in America). Since the Big Four are structured as associations of national partnerships, Boozâ€™s staff would probably end up being divided by country, hindering the global co-operation that many big clients seek. Most important, each of Boozâ€™s 300 partners would have to trade meaningful sway over the direction of a highly profitable firm for a minuscule stake in a diversified, lower-margin empire. If the sale is approved, the test of its success will come in a few years, after Boozâ€™s partners receive their full payout and can head off. An exodus would leave PwC empty-handed. The Big Four are also running a risk far greater than the cost of their purchases. A decade ago they placated regulators by retreating from advisory work. High-profile deals like the Booz-PwC tie-up put the conflict of interest between auditing and consulting back in the spotlight: after it was announced, Arthur Levitt, a former head of Americaâ€™s Securities and Exchange Commission, warned that the firms were â€œslipping backâ€ù towards old, bad habits. Any gains from pushing into strategy work might end up being outweighed by the cost of another regulatory crackdown.",https://www.economist.com/news/business/21589435-big-consulting-and-accounting-firms-are-making-risky-move-strategy-work-strategic-moves
economist,Oct 16th 2017,Why Ivanka Trump wants to extend the child tax credit," More importantly, expanding the child tax credit might be the only way Mr Trump gives some middle-class Americans the tax cut he has promised them. Other features of his draft planâ€”chiefly the loss of personal exemptionsâ€”suggest that families with children could otherwise end up being worse off. An expanded child tax credit could make up the difference, but only if it is big enough. According to a study by the Tax Policy Center, a non-partisan think-tank, a $500-a-child increase to the existing child tax credit could (subject to a number of other assumptions) lead to an overall tax increase on 17% of households with children by 2018 and 44% by 2027. That is why Marco Rubio, a senator from Florida, says it should be doubled, to $2,000-a-child, and made fully refundable. In other words, poor families who do not pay federal income tax could claim the credit in the form of a cash payout from the Internal Revenue Service. Mr Trump's current plan would not make any increase refundable. And because doubling the size of the credit would be expensive, it is unlikely to pass. But, ""any extension would be seen as a big win for Ivanka Trump"", says Aparna Mathur,Â a resident scholar in economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute.

Herman Cain, the warm-up act, delivered the standard denunciation of the media (liars) and the polls (rigged), before introducing Ivanka and Tiffany. Ivanka spoke only briefly, not mentioning the ideas for childcare credits and maternity leave that have bolstered her fatherâ€™s pitch to women. Tiffany was even briefer. The crowd didnâ€™t seem to mind. â€œYouâ€™re amazing,â€ù a devotee yelled; â€œWe love youâ€ù shouted another. Then the Trumps got down to the serious business of the afternoon, namely posing for their supportersâ€™ selfies, before moving on to a meeting with local businesswomen.Â  Political rallies are like violence: to those in the thick of them, they feel all-consuming, the centre of the world, even if from a distance they turn out to be insignificant. The views of diehard Trump supporters are unrepresentative, a fact that may prove more than usually disorienting for some of them on November 9th. But events such as this are revealing all the same, about both the priorities of the campaignâ€”in this case, its last-gasp struggle to win back women votersâ€”and its semiotics. In the embrace of the Trump family there is hint of a submerged yen for monarchy which, in America, seems to have cross-fertilised with a worship of celebrityâ€”and helped to propel Mr Trumpâ€™s candidacy.

economist,Jul 15th 2017,The Trump family demonstrates why America shuns hereditary rule," In contrast, any hint of disrespect for a Trump child provokes indignation from the president, so that few Republicans in Congress care to exercise robust oversight of his daughter, Ivanka, or her husband, Jared Kushner, who both serve as senior advisers, with Mr Kushner wielding influence over dossiers from domestic economics to peace in the Middle East. In February Mr Trump attacked Nordstrom, a clothing chain, for dropping a fashion line branded by Ivanka, complaining on both his personal and government Twitter accounts that she had been â€œtreated so unfairlyâ€ù. The president took to Twitter again this week to defend his daughter, enraged by scoffing in the world press after he asked her to fill his seat briefly at the G20 summit. A press secretary for Mr Trump felt obliged to denounce such questioning of his daughterâ€™s role as an â€œoutrageous attack against a White House senior adviserâ€ù. Congress has been feeble in policing potential conflicts of interest involving the Trump Organisation, headed by Donald junior and his brother Eric, as foreign governments book rooms or receptions at Trump properties, including a hotel a few minutes from the White House. Struggling to engage with a nationalist, America First president with a limited attention-span, foreign governments are learning to use his family to sway him. Angela Merkel of Germany invited Ivanka Trump to a summit on womenâ€™s empowerment. Arab delegations in Washington enthuse that dealing with Mr Kushner is a great comfort, as talking to rulersâ€™ relations is the Arab way. As for Asia, â€œbecause China is not remotely interested in the democratic health of the United Statesâ€ù, its leaders and tycoons are happy to flatter Mr Trump or do business deals with his family, giving China an advantage over more squeamish Western powers, sighs a diplomat who sees this process up close. The father, the son and the holey Russia defence In private, envoys to Washington compare the Trump children to princes and princesses in a royal court. That is a bit unfair to princes: such modern examples as William and Harry in Britain talk of duty, of humility and of shunning politics precisely because they are unelected. The Trump children are more self-congratulatory, praising their father for selflessly giving up a life that was â€œthe epitome of the American dreamâ€ù to serve as president. Donald junior bragged to the Republican National Convention about youthful visits to construction sites: â€œweâ€™re the only children of billionairesâ€ù as happy in a bulldozer as in a car, he said. Many grassroots conservatives cheer along. Last October Lexington watched Donald junior tell Republican campaign volunteers in Reno, Nevada, that his family was â€œsickâ€ù of â€œdisgustingâ€ù media attacks, prompting one to reassure him: â€œIâ€™d like to thank your family for going through the hell you are going through.â€ù Americaâ€™s founders recoiled from the hereditary principle.

economist,Oct 13th 2016,Hacked off," Predictably in this age of canyon-deep political divisions, the actual content of the hacked e-mails is now being overshadowed by partisan squabbling about the motives of those who stole them and made them public, and about the honesty of the news organisations sifting through them and assessing their importance. In July WikiLeaks released almost 20,000 e-mails from the accounts of officials at the Democratic National Committee, showing that the supposedly neutral party headquarters was rooting for Mrs Clinton to beat Mr Sandersâ€”a not-very-startling revelation that led to the resignation of the DNC chairman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Hackers linked to Russian intelligence agencies were quickly accused of involvement. On October 7th the Department of Homeland Security and the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, issued a remarkable statement declaring their confidence that the Russian government directed â€œrecent compromises of e-mailsâ€ù of individuals and political organisations in order to â€œinterfere with the US election processâ€ù. Mr Trump has pushed back on such findings, including in his most recent TV debate with Mrs Clinton, when he said that his opponent â€œdoesnâ€™t know if itâ€™s the Russians doing the hacking,â€ù and speculated: â€œMaybe there is no hacking.â€ù Mr Podesta, in his airborne press briefing two days after that debate, said that the FBI is investigating a â€œcriminal hackâ€ù of his account, adding: â€œRussian interference in this election and apparently on behalf of Trump is, I think, of the utmost concern to all Americans, whether youâ€™re a Democrat or independent or Republican.â€ù That vision of cross-party consensus is a trifle optimistic. In a campaign rally in Florida, Mr Trump denounced Mrs Clintonâ€™s leaked daydreaming about a common market of the Americas, declaring: â€œAmerican soldiers have fought and died to win and keep Americaâ€™s freedom, and now Hillary Clinton wants to surrender that freedom to these open borders, open trade, and a world government.â€ù Warming to his theme, he decided that the leaked e-mails confirm that Mrs Clinton is the â€œvesselâ€ù of a â€œcriminal government cartel [that] doesnâ€™t recognise borders but believes in global governance, unlimited immigration and rule by corporations.â€ù Later, in an angry tweet, the Republican nominee accused news outlets of burying the story, grumbling: â€œVery little pick-up by the dishonest media of incredible information provided by WikiLeaks. So dishonest! Rigged system!â€ù To simplify, Mr Trump has two main goals in these final weeks. First, to bring home unhappy voters who voted Republican in previous presidential contests but who loathe him: a group that notably includes educated white women in suburbia. Second, to depress Mrs Clintonâ€™s support among Democrats and swing voters. Mr Trumpâ€™s rhetoric about hacked e-mails may help him with the second task, but does almost nothing to help with the first.

economist,Jul 29th 2016,The Democratsâ€™ orchestral finale," Mrs Clintonâ€™s task was complicated by the persistence, inside the hall, of heckling from a few Sandernistasâ€”a startling self-indulgence given that, on the eve of the convention, their partyâ€™s now-official nominee trailed Mr Trump in some opinion polls. Earlier they had heckled John Allen, a stentorian retired general, and even a combat veteran who was maimed in a suicide bombing, with chants of â€œno more warâ€ù. Those were drowned out by much louder cries of â€œU-S-Aâ€ù; together with a profuse waving of the Stars-and-Stripes, the chants contributed to what often felt like a pageant of patriotismâ€”one which, to many observers, seemed to befit a Republican gathering more than a traditional Democratic one. Most television viewers will have seen the flag-waving but missed the childish antics of the hecklers. Earlier, the themes of national security and tolerance were bridged in an astonishing appearance by Khizr Khan, the father of a Muslim-American soldier killed in Iraq. There had been numerous heartwrenching cameos during this well-choreographed convention, notably from the mothers of Sandra Bland, a black woman who died in police custody, and of Christopher Leinonen, a victim of the Orlando massacre. But the moment Mr Khan produced a copy of Americaâ€™s constitution and waved it reprovingly at Donald Trump was the most memorable.Â  That anticipated the best parts of Mrs Clintonâ€™s own speech, which were her attacks on her opponent. Mr Trump, she observed, invoking Ronald Reagan, had â€œtaken the Republican Party a long way: from morning in America to midnight in America.â€ù She rebuked his pessimism with Franklin Rooseveltâ€™s dictum about â€œfear itself. â€œAmerica is great,â€ù she declared, in a twofer that took on both Mr Trumpâ€™s gloom and his bigotry, â€œbecause America is good.â€ù As Mr Obama had, she portrayed Mr Trumpâ€™sÂ egotism as fundamentally un-American. Her countrymen, she said, â€œdonâ€™t say â€˜I aloneÂ can fix itâ€™. We say â€˜weâ€™ll fix it togetherâ€™.â€ù In one of her slickest zingers she noted that â€œa man you can bait with a tweet is not a man you can trust with nuclear weapons.â€ù Over the course of the convention, the enthusiasm for Mrs Clinton in the hall had progressed from dutifulness to something more authentic. The tipping point was the speech given by her husband Bill, who amid his rambling folksiness managed to portray her as a woman of principle and a real-life human being. Most of the Sandernistas were silenced if not entirely won over. How far she can yet extend that appeal remains to be seen, however. Too many of the speeches focused on virtues of the candidate that are not much in dispute: her brains, her political consistency, her hard work, experience and so on. It is unclear whether the most damaging perceptionâ€”that she is untrustworthyâ€”can be salved. Another attribute that was often touted was the candidateâ€™s toughness. Chelsea Clinton reverted to that mantra in her insistence that her mother was â€œa fighter who never, ever gives up.â€ù The reason for that emphasis may in part be because of the salient threat of terrorism, in part a tacit recognition of the bare-knuckle dust-up that American politics has becomeâ€”and in part because Mrs Clinton is a woman. To historians her achievement in becoming the first female presidential candidate for a major party may be the most important aspect of this convention; it mattered hugely to many of her supporters in the room. But it can sometimes seem that, in the broader electorate, this momentous breakthrough has not garnered quite the notice or accolades it deserves. That may be precisely because it seems so belated, or because Mrs Clintonâ€™s candidacy seemed inevitable for so long. Or because she is Mrs Clinton.

economist,Nov 2nd 2016,Hillary Clinton targets Arizona in the final stretch," A growing Hispanic population will also play a part in any shift towards the Democrats. Hispanics make up nearly 31% of the stateâ€™s population, up from 19% in 1990. It is an article of faith among Arizona Democrats that this will move the stateâ€™s political currents in their favour, but Ms Tameron insists that Mr Trump â€œhelps kind of jump our timeline.â€ù On November 3rd, Tim Kaine, Mrs Clinton's running mate, will hold rallies in Phoenix and in Tucson, the stateâ€™s second-largest city. In Phoenix, he will speak entirely in Spanish. Â  Indeed, with Arizona and its 11 electoral votes apparently up for grabs, the Clinton campaign has started pushing hard. On October 17th, it announced that it was committing $2m to the state, much of which is being used for a barrage of television advertising. Over the following three days, Bernie Sanders, Chelsea Clinton and Michelle Obama, the popular first lady, were sent to Arizona to stump for Mrs Clinton. Most activity from both campaigns has centered on the greater Phoenix area, a sprawling desert metropolis that is home to more than 60% of Arizonaâ€™s population.Â  By making a play for Arizona, Mrs Clinton is chasing history. It has been twenty years since a Democratic presidential candidate won the state. The last was Bill Clinton, who won a plurality, though not a majority of the stateâ€™s votes in 1996 thanks to two factors: a lacklustre Republican opponent and a vigorous independent candidate. At the time, Arizona had gone longer without favouring a Democrat for president than any other state in history. Not since Harry Trumanâ€™s surprise win in 1948 had Arizona jilted a Republican presidential nominee. Arizona voters havenâ€™t elected a Democrat to a major state-wide office in a decade, and Republicans have controlled the stateâ€™s legislature almost uninterrupted since the late 1960s. There is another factor that may work in Mrs Clinton's favour. Arizona is one of 34 states that offer some form of early voting, and though Democrats trail slightly in getting their voters to mail in their ballots, the Republican Party may be underperforming. Chris DeRose, a Republican running for a city council seat in northern Phoenix, said the difference in the early ballot returns in his district between 2016 and four years ago is stark. â€œIn 2012 Republicans had a 13% early ballot advantage in early voting in my district. So far itâ€™s 5%,â€ù Mr DeRose said. If that is a sign that some Republican voters have decided to simply sit out the election rather than cast their ballots for Mr Trump, a historic win may be in reach for Mrs Clinton.

economist,Jan 26th 2012,The joy of e-giving," Mr Schmidt was at his most interesting on the subject of the next generation of Silicon Valley rich, who he says are more concerned about society's problems and much more generous than his own Baby Boom generation. The ""one percent rule"", whereby a firm gives away 1% of annual profits, 1% of its equity and 1% of its employees' time, pioneered by Salesforce.com and adopted by Google, is now the norm for Silicon Valley start-ups, said Mr Schmidt. Alas, he was not asked what went wrong with Google.org, which was launched with much fanfare as the future of corporate philanthropy, but has since sunk almost without trace. Mr Schmidt predicts that the mobile phone will be the most philanthropic (in the broadest sense) of all the new technologies, especially once its cost in the developing world falls to around $70. One of the striking things about mobile telephony is that it is already delivering huge social benefits even though it is largely commercially driven, rather than relying on charitable donations or government aid.Â  Mr Ross agreed, highlighting how money had been raised cheaply by text to help in Haiti after the earthquake in 2010. He talked excitedly about the benefits of a mobile app that has been developed to let Masai warriors more effectively monitor the menstrual cycles of dairy cows, and thereby greatly increase their productivity. As he rightly pointed out, this is not something that would ever be thought of by government or ""in Davos"". Perhaps the most interesting new idea came from the audience where, this being Davos, sat Tim Berners Lee. The inventor of the internet suggested a radical approach to improving the effectiveness of philanthropy through extreme charity: it should become a routine activity, he suggested, that anyone receiving a donation should publish in cyberspace exactly what they do with it, all the way along the line until the money reaches its ultimate charitable destination.

economist,Jan 26th 2013,Davos Man and his defects," What can be done? Much of the answer lies in giving the little guys better tools to keep Davos Man in check: stricter accountability for government leaders, sounder regulations to curb corporate abuses. But there is also a case for reforming the global-leadership industry. The people who run it need to think hard about what they mean by both globalisation and leadership. People whose jobs require constant whizzing through airports often overestimate the extent of globalisation. Most other folk live in the same country all their lives. Most trade occurs within national borders. Nearly all politics is local. Company bosses who fail to notice this may underestimate political risks or ignore cultural differences, and such errors may prove disastrous. The best global leaders need to immerse themselves in local cultures. Leadership has always been a slippery concept, and is getting slipperier by the day. In the West, as deference collapses and knowledge workers rise, companies have flattened their management hierarchies. But many non-Western companies continue to believe in hierarchy. In India and China, leaders are often lofty figures and companies have lots of rungs to be climbed. And disruptive innovation can put a premium on command-and-control. Apple thrived as a dictatorship under Steve Jobs; Nokiaâ€™s consensus-seeking leaders let the firm crumble. Global-leadership gurus also need to think more carefully about the relationship between business and the wider world. It sounds noble to promise, as practically every boss in Davos does, that your company will solve all manner of problems unrelated to its core business. For companies in emerging markets, this may make sense: if they do not build a road to their mine in a remote area, no one else will. In rich countries, however, governments leave fewer gaps that so obviously need filling. Talk of social responsibility needs to be realistic: it is more dangerous to promise too much than too little. There are signs that the global-leadership industry is trying to shape up. Harvard Business School obliges its students to spend time in other countries. Companies increasingly expect their high-flyers to spend time running far-flung subsidiaries. Henkel, a German chemical-maker, insists that executives live in at least two different countries before being considered for promotion. NestlÃ©, a Swiss food company, boasts executive board members from eight different countries. The WEF urges charities to learn from businesses and vice versa. Management gurus are producing new measuring devices: the Global Leadership and Organisational Behaviour Effectiveness (GLOBE) project has surveyed more than 17,000 managers in 62 countries to identify cultural differences that leaders ought to know about. Americans are unusually assertive, apparently, and Brazilians surprisingly unconcerned about the future. World leaders with wings of wax But there is still a flaw with the very notion of global leadership. Abraham Lincoln observed that â€œnearly all men can stand adversity but if you want to test a manâ€™s character, give him power.â€ù Similar temptations afflict those who are given the title of â€œyoung global leaderâ€ù. Clever businesspeople have a tendency to be arrogant at the best of the times; telling them that they are masters of the universe can only magnify it. Arrogance breeds mistakes: look at all the empire-building bosses who attempt ambitious mergers despite ample evidence that such mergers usually fail. If leadership has a secret sauce, it may well be humility. A humble boss understands that there are things he doesnâ€™t know. He listens: not only to the other bigwigs in Davos, but also to the kind of people who donâ€™t get invited, such as his customers.

economist,Jan 21st 2017,Xi Jinping portrays China as a rock of stability," The timing of Mr Xiâ€™s trip was fortuitousâ€”according to the Financial Times his aides were working on it before Britain voted to leave the European Union and well before Mr Trumpâ€™s election victory. But he must have relished the points that those events enabled him to score at Davos. Mr Xi faces political battles of his own as he prepares for a five-yearly Communist Party congress in the autumn and a reshuffle right after it. He wants to install more of his allies in key positions. Standing tall on the world stage could help (and attending Davos will have reinforced the point to his colleagues that he is in charge of Chinaâ€™s economy, as he clearly is of every other main portfolio). Mr Xi would have relished the occasion even had the predictions of many in the global elite a year ago proved accurateâ€”that Britain would vote to stay in the EU and that Mr Trump would not win. The forum is one where embarrassing questions about Chinaâ€™s politics are seldom raised openly. Mr Xi could talk airily of Chinaâ€™s openness, with little fear of being asked why he is clamping down on dissent and tightening controls on the internet (last year this newspaperâ€™s website joined the many foreign ones that are blocked). On January 14th Chinaâ€™s most senior judge condemned judicial independence as a â€œfalse Western idealâ€ù. Previously, the highest-ranking Chinese attendees had been prime ministers. In 2016 the vice-president, Li Yuanchao, who ranks lower than the prime minister in the party hierarchy, led the team. So why has Mr Xi waited until his fifth year as president to turn up? He may well have winced at the thought of doing so last year, when discussions were dominated by questions about Chinaâ€™s management of its slowing economy in the wake of a stockmarket crash and a sudden devaluation of the yuan. Many analysts still worry about Chinaâ€™s economy (not least its growing debt), but the Westâ€™s problems have loomed larger over the Swiss Alps this week. And for all his uplifting talk, Mr Xi shows no signs of wanting to take over as the worldâ€™s chief troubleshooter, even if Mr Trump shuns that role. Mr Xi is preoccupied with managing affairs at home and asserting control in seas nearby (see article). â€œNothing is perfect in the world,â€ù the new Davos man sagely informed the delegates.
