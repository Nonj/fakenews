economist,Nov 2nd 2017,A lot to like and a lot to dislike in the Republican tax bill," A DEBATE has raged this year about whether the Republican effort on taxes should be described as “tax reform”—which implies improving efficiency and fairness–or just “tax cuts”. Parts of the tax bill released, at long last, by House Republicans on November 2nd are worthy of the first title. The tax bill aggressively takes on deductions in the individual income tax code, and channels the proceeds towards across-the-board cuts in income tax.  Unfortunately, that good work is undone by expensive giveaways to the owners of firms, and unnecessary windfalls to the heirs of the rich. As a result, the bill would saddle the economy with more debt, and could end up being a drag on growth.

The National Rifle Association endorsed him, as did the Club for Growth, a low-tax advocacy group. But he not only declined to endorse President Donald Trump last year, he wrote a book condemning Mr Trump’s influence on conservatism. For someone as indifferent to policy and demanding of personal loyalty as Mr Trump, that proved unacceptable. The president repeatedly lambasted Mr Flake and praised Kelli Ward, his highest-profile primary challenger, whom Stephen Bannon, Mr Trump’s former chief strategist, has endorsed. That augured a bruising campaign that Mr Flake decided was best avoided.

A year away from his departure from the Oval Office, Mr Obama now has one more chance to persuade a court to give his immigration policy the green light. FOR THE third straight year, the Supreme Court will ask whether Barack Obama overstepped his executive authority under the constitution. In 2014, the justices slapped Mr Obama on the wrist for taking liberties in making unilateral appointments to federal agencies while the Senate (which is supposed to give its “advice and consent”) was in session. Last year, they evened the score, siding with the White House in a tussle with Congress over who gets to recognise foreign governments.

economist,Dec 8th 2015,Why it is nearly impossible for America to pass gun-control laws," ONE day after 14 people died and 21 were injured in a mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, America's Senate defeated a bill that would have prevented people on the terror watch list from buying guns. Making things a bit more difficult for people bent on killing Americans might sound like a rather moderate reform. But 54 conservative senators determined that such a rule might impinge on the gun rights of innocent Americans who were mistakenly placed on the watch-list—a risk assessment that is hard to square with the calculus used by many of the same lawmakers who oppose resettling Syrian refugees lest one of them turn into a terrorist. In the wake of the school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut that killed 20 children and 6 staff members in 2012, a bipartisan bill to enhance background checks for gun purchasers came up a few votes short. It was voted down last week as well. It seems even the mildest measure to curb guns in America is doomed to fail.

economist,May 12th 2016,Restrictive laws do not necessarily lower abortion rates," TRACKING abortion rates is a hard task. Some countries under-report them, and many do not report them at all. A new paper published in the Lancet, led by Gilda Sedgh of the Guttmacher Institute, and the World Health Organisation, is only the fourth such study, and supersedes previous estimates that are considered too conservative. The authors (who also produced the last study four years ago) estimate that the global rate fell slightly from 40 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15-44 in 1990, to 35 in 2014. But this masks a wide variation by income and by region. In the developed world, rates declined dramatically from 46 to 27 as better family planning and education became available to women to prevent unintended pregnancies. The steepest drop was seen in eastern Europe following the break-up of the Soviet Union, as women gained access to family planning and modern contraception. By contrast, the abortion rate has stayed relatively unchanged in developing regions and the share of pregnancies ending in abortion has nudged up from 21% to 24%. This matters: 50m of the 56m abortions every year are in developing countries. In Latin America, which has restrictive abortion laws and the highest abortion rates, one in three pregnancies ended in abortion in 2014, higher than any other region. Restrictive laws do not appear to lower the number of procedures, but do increase the likelihood of health risks to women who must seek unsafe procedures. Around $300m a year is spent treating an estimated 7m women who suffer complications after unsafe abortions.",https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2016/05/new-global-abortion-study

economist,Oct 18th 2017,Donald Trump’s latest travel ban is blocked by two federal judges," SEVEN months ago, Derrick Watson, a federal judge in Hawaii, blocked Donald Trump’s second ban on travel from Muslim countries before it could go into effect.

On October 17th, Judge Watson (pictured above) struck again, freezing Mr Trump’s latest travel ban, which would have taken effect at 12:01am on October 18th. The judge said the new order—which removes Sudan but adds Chad, North Korea and Venezuelan government officials to the forbidden list, and makes the ban permanent—“suffers from precisely the same maladies as its predecessor”.

Twice a year an official visits his office and talks to his boss. Sometimes, when foreign dignitaries are visiting, he is not allowed to leave his house. In 2015 he was brutally beaten up by a group of thugs. The authorities regularly break up the practice sessions of a football team that includes him and other dissidents. Yet even he is surprised by the recent crackdown on dissent, with around 25 people arrested or exiled this year alone. The government’s “heavy campaign” is puzzling, he says.

It was also Mr Abe’s fifth successive electoral victory. If he remains four more years at the country’s helm, as is likely, halfway into his term he will become Japan’s longest-serving prime minister since the second world war.

Mark Sykes, a British diplomat, rushed out to share the good news: “Weizmann, it’s a boy!” But the 67-word declaration was vague. It offered a Jewish “homeland”, not a state. Nor did Britain explain how it would be created, promising only “best endeavours” to do so. The Zionist leader’s first reaction was disappointment.

economist,Dec 11th 2016,The alarming response to Russian meddling in American democracy," WHY is it unsettling to see Republicans and Democrats squabbling, afresh, about Russian meddling in last month’s presidential election? After all, the basic allegation being debated has been out there for months: namely, that in 2015 and again in 2016 at least two groups of hackers with known links to Russian intelligence broke into the computer systems of the Democratic National Committee, as that party’s national headquarters is known, and into the private e-mail system of such figures as John Podesta, the chairman of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, then released a slew of embarrassing e-mails to Wikileaks. Before the election a joint public statement by the director of national intelligence and secretary of homeland security said that intelligence agencies are “confident” that the Russian government directed the hacking. That statement did little to sway supporters of Donald Trump, who heard their candidate cast doubt on that intelligence finding, and instead revel in the contents of the stolen e-mails as they hit the press. This, Mr Trump, suggested, was just more evidence that his opponent deserved the soubriquet “Crooked Hillary”.

A millennium and a half old, its ruined palace still features the world’s largest unsupported brick arch.

economist,Aug 12th 2017,A referendum on Kurdish independence from Iraq carries grave risks," THE enormous new statue of a peshmerga soldier, overlooking the Baba Gurgur oilfield, just outside Kirkuk, is a stark indication of the Iraqi Kurds’ aspirations to establish an independent state with borders that stretch beyond their historic homeland to encompass some of Iraq’s richest oilfields. A referendum on independence scheduled for September 25th will probably move the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) further down that path. But the timing of the poll has been questioned, not least because it is unclear what will come after. Some fear that a vote for independence will elicit violent responses from the government in Baghdad and from neighbouring countries.

economist,Aug 3rd 2017,Lessons for Brexit from the invasion of Iraq," ONE of the striking things about the Brexiteers is how keen they are on history. Many studied it at university, usually Oxford: Bill Cash, John Redwood and Chris Grayling from the older generation and Daniel Hannan, Dominic Cummings and Douglas Carswell from the younger. They rest their argument for Brexit as much on historical exceptionalism as on economic logic. Britain is simply too different from continental European powers, with their Napoleonic codes and Verfassungspatriotismus, to fit in. And they relish historical parallels: between Brexit and Henry VIII’s break with Rome; between the Brexiteers and the anti-Corn Law activists who destroyed 19th-century England’s equivalent of the Common Agricultural Policy; and between the legislation that will translate European law into British law and the 1832 Great Reform Act. Nigel Farage, the least cerebral of the Brexiteers, has encouraged young Britons to see “Dunkirk”, a new film, to stiffen their spines for the struggle ahead.

economist,Jun 30th 2017,Iraq claims a slightly premature victory over Islamic State," IRAQ’S prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, has claimed victory over Islamic State (IS), after his army captured the ruins of Mosul’s 12th-century al-Nuri mosque, where IS’s leader declared his “caliphate”. It has been an arduous campaign. Previous battles for the city have been short-lived. In 1918 and 2003, opposition melted away when British and American forces marched into the city. But IS’s defence of Iraq’s second city against an overwhelmingly more powerful coalition has lasted for over eight months. Obstacles and trenches have cut up the approach roads into and all over the city. Even now two small pockets in the city remain, including several main streets in the heart of the Old City adjoining the Tigris River. Some 75,000 in the city, military sources say, remain under IS control.

Three years of turmoil in the region, on the back of unpopular American-led wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, have benefited extreme Islamists, none more so than the Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria (ISIS), a group that outdoes even al-Qaeda in brutality and fanaticism. In the past year or so, as borders and government control have frayed across the region, ISIS has made gains across a swathe of territory encompassing much of eastern and northern Syria and western and northern Iraq. On June 10th it achieved its biggest prize to date by capturing Mosul, Iraq’s second city, and most of the surrounding province of Nineveh. The next day it advanced south towards Baghdad, the capital, taking several towns on the way. Ministers in Iraq’s government admitted that a catastrophe was in the making.
